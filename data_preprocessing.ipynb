I’m here to represent the interests of the America people and affirm America’s friendship and partnership in building a better world.     Like all nations represented at this great forum, America hopes for a future which everyone can prosper and every child can grow up free from violence, poverty, and fear. Over the past year, we have made extraordinary strides in the U.S. We’re lifting up forgotten communities, creating exciting new opportunities, and helping every American find their path to the American dream. The dream of a great job, a safe home and a better life for their children.          After years stagnation the nights is once again experiencing strong economic growth. The stock market is smashing one record after another, and has added more than $7 trillion in new wealth since my election. Consumer confidence, business confidence, and manufacturing confidence are the highest that they have been in many decades.          Since my election we’ve created 2.4 million jobs and that number is going up very, very substantially. Small business optimism is at an all-time high. New unemployment claims are near the lowest we’ve seen in almost half a century. African-American unemployment reached the lowest rate ever recorded in the United States and so has unemployment among Hispanic-Americans.          The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America. I’m here to deliver a simple message. There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the united States. America is open for business and we are competitive once again. The American economy is by far the largest in the world and we’ve just enacted the most significant tax cuts and reform in American history. We’ve massively cut taxes for the middle class, and small businesses to let working families keep more of their hard earned money.          We lowered our corporate tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent. As a result, millions of workers have received tax cut bonuses from their employers in amounts as large as $3,000. The tax cut bill is expected to raise the average American’s household income by more than $4,000. The world’s largest company, apple, announced it plans to bring $245 billion in overseas profits home to America. Their total investment into the United States economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years. Now is the perfect time to bring your business, your jobs, and your investments to the United States.          This is especially true because we have undertaken the most extensively regulatory reduction ever conceived. Regulation is stealth taxation. The U.S. Like many other countries unelected bureaucrats, we have, believe me, we have them all over the place, and they have imposed crushing and anti-business and anti-worker regulations on our citizens with no vote, no legislative debate, and no real accountability. In America those days are over. I pledged to eliminate two unnecessary regulations for everyone new regulation. We have succeeded beyond our highest expectations. Instead of two for one, we have cut 22 burdensome regulations for everyone new rule. We are freeing our businesses and workers so they can thrive and flourish as never before. We are creating an environment that attracts capital, invites investment, and rewards production. America is the place to do business, so come to America where you can innovate, create and build.          I believe in America. As president of the United States I will always put America first just like the leaders of other countries should put their country first also. But America first does not mean America alone. When the United States grows, so does the world. American prosperity has created countless jobs all around the globe and the drive for excellence, creativity, and innovation in the U.S. Has led to important discoveries that help people everywhere live more prosperous and far healthier lives.          As the United States pursues domestic reforms to unleash jobs and growth, we are also working to reform the international trading system so that it promotes broadly-shared prosperity and rewards to those who pray -- play by the rules. We cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others. We support free trade but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal because in the end unfair trade undermines us all. The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices including massive intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive state-led economic planning.          These and other predatory behaviors are distorting the global markets and harming businesses and workers not just in the U.S. But around the globe. Just like we expect the leaders of other countries to protect their interests, as president of the United States, I will always protect the interests of our country, our companies, and our workers. We will enforce our trade laws and restore integrity to our trading system. Only by insisting on fair and reciprocal trade can we create a system that works not just for the U.S., but for all nations.               As I have said, the United States is prepared to negotiate mutually beneficial, bilateral trade agreements with all countries. This will include the countries within TPP, which are very important. We have agreements with several of them already. We would consider negotiating with the rest either individually or perhaps as a group if it is in the interests of all. My administration is also taking swift action in other ways to restore American confidence and independent. We are lifting self-imposed restrictions on energy production to provide affordable power to our citizens and businesses and to promote energy security for our friend all around the world. No country should be held hostage to a single provider of energy. America is roaring back and now is the time to invest in the future of America.                We have dramatically cut taxes it make America competitive. We are eliminating burdensome regulations at a record pace. We are reforming the bureaucracy to make it lean, responsive and accountable and we are insuring our laws are enforced fairly. We have the best colleges and universities in the world and we have the best workers in the world. Energy is an abundant and affordable. There is never been a better time to do business in America. We are also making historic investments in the American military because we cannot have prosperity without security. To make the world safer from rogue regimes, terrorism and revisionist powers, we’re asking our friend and allies to invest in their own defenses and to meet their financial obligations. Our common security requires everyone to contribute their fair share.          My administration is proud to have led historic efforts at the united nations security council and all around the world to unite all civilized nations in our campaign of maximum pressure to de-nuke the Korean peninsula. We continue to call on partners to confront Iran’s support for terrorists and block Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon. We’re also working with allies and partners to destroy jihad it terrorist organizations such as ISIS and very successfully so. The nights is leading a very, very broad coalition to deny terrorists control of their territory and populations, to cut off their funding and to discredit their wicked ideology. I am pleased to the support that the coalition to defeat ISIS has retaken almost 100% of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria. There is still more fighting and worked to be done. And to consolidate our gains. We are committed to insuring that Afghanistan never again become as safe haven for terrorists who want to commit mass murder to our civilian populations.          I want to thank those nations represented here today that have joined in these crucial efforts. You are not just securing your own citizens but saving lives and restoring hope for millions and millions of people. When it comes to terrorism we will do whatever is necessary to protect our nation. We will defend our citizens and our borders. We are also securing our immigration system as a matter of both national and economic security. America is a cutting-edge economy but our immigration system is stuck in the past.          We must replace our current system of extended family chain migration with a merit-based system of admissions that selects new arrivals based on their ability to contribute to our economy, to support themselves financially, and to strengthen our country.          In rebuilding America we are also fully committed to developing our workforce. We are lifting people from dependence to Independence because we know the single-best anti-poverty program is a very simple and very beautiful paycheck. To be successful it is not enough to invest in our economy.               We must invest in our people. When people are forgotten the world becomes fractured. Only by hearing and responding to the voices of the forgotten can we create a bright future that is truly shared by all. The nation’s greatness is more than the sum of its production and a nation’s greatness is the sum of its citizens, the values, pride, love, devotion and character of the people who call that nation home.          From my first international G-7 summit to the g20, to the U.N. General assembly, to APEC, to the world trade organization and today at the world economic forum my administration has not only been present but has driven our message that we are all stronger when free, sovereign nations cooperate towards shared goals and they cooperate toward shared dreams. Represented in this room are shared dreams.          Represented in this room are some of the remarkable citizens from all over the worlds. You are national leaders, business titans, industry giants and many of the brightest mind in many fields. Each of you has the power to change hearts transform lives and shape your country’s destinies. With this power comes an obligation however, a duty of loyalty to the people, workers, customers, who made you who you are.          Together let us resolve it use our power, our resources and our voices, not just for ourselves but for our people, to lift their burdens, to raise their hopes and to empower their dreams. To protect their families, their communities, their histories and their futures. That’s what we’re doing in America, and the results are totally unmistakable. It’s why new businesses and investment are flooding in. It’s why our unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been in so many decades. It’s why America’s future has negative been brighter.          Today, I am inviting all of you to become part of this incredible future we are building together. Thank you to our hosts, thank you to the leaders and innovators in the audience but most importantly, thank you, to all of the hard-working men and women who do their duty each and every day, making this a better world for everyone. Together let us send our love and our gratitude to make them because they really make our countries run. They make our countries great. Thank you and god bless you all. Thank you very much.\"\n",

            "  \"Text\": \"Friends, delegates, and distinguished guests: I stand before you tonight honored by your support; proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four years; and brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build for America over the NEXT four years!     As we begin this evening, our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura. We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi, sparing no effort to save lives. While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago. This is due to the great work of FEMA, law enforcement, and the individual states. I will be going this weekend. We are one national family, and we will always protect, love and care for each other.          Here tonight are the people who have made my journey possible, and filled my life with so much joy.          For her incredible service to our nation and its children, I want to thank our magnificent First Lady. I also want to thank my amazing daughter Ivanka for that introduction, and to all of my children and grandchildren – I love you more than words can express. I know my brother Robert is looking down on us right now from Heaven. He was a great brother and was very proud of the job we are doing. Let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side, and stood up for our values – a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction: Vice President Mike Pence. Mike is joined by his beloved wife, a teacher and military mom, Karen Pence.          My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States.          The Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, goes forward united, determined, and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, Independents, and anyone who believes in the GREATNESS of America and the righteous heart of the American People.          In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history – quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and RECORD prosperity! We will DEFEND AMERICA against all threats, and protect America against all dangers. We will LEAD AMERICA into new frontiers of ambition and discovery, and we will reach for new heights of national achievement. We will rekindle new faith in our values, new pride in our history, and a new spirit of unity that can ONLY be realized through love for our country. Because we understand that America is NOT a land cloaked in darkness, America is the torch that enlightens the entire world.          Gathered here at our beautiful and majestic White House – known all over the world as the People’s House – we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our Great American Story. This has been the home of larger-than-life figures like Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future. Within these walls lived tenacious generals like Presidents Grant and Eisenhower who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom. From these grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark on a daring expedition to cross a wild and uncharted continent. In the depths of a bloody Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed Washington Monument – and asked God, in His Providence, to save our union. Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt welcomed Winston Churchill, and just inside, they set our people on a course to victory in the Second World War.          In recent months, our nation, and the entire planet, has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy. Like those brave Americans before us, we are meeting this challenge. We are delivering lifesaving therapies, and will produce a vaccine BEFORE the end of the year, or maybe even sooner! We will defeat THE VIRUS, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before.          What united generations past was an unshakable confidence in America’s destiny, and an unbreakable faith in the American People. They knew that our country is blessed by God, and has a special purpose in this world. It is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union, our westward expansion, the abolition of slavery, the passage of civil rights, the space program, and the overthrow of fascism, tyranny and communism.          This towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge, and lifted us to the summit of human endeavor.          And yet, despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now endangered. This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas.          This election will decide whether we SAVE the American Dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to DEMOLISH our cherished destiny.          It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades.          Your vote will decide whether we protect law abiding Americans, or whether we give free reign to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten our citizens.          And this election will decide whether we will defend the American Way of Life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it.          At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice. So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?          In the left’s backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins.          Our opponents say that redemption for YOU can only come from giving power to THEM. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history.          But in this country, we don’t look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we don’t turn to government to restore our souls – we put our faith in Almighty God.          Joe Biden is not the savior of America’s soul – he is the destroyer of America’s Jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American Greatness.          For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain – and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands. Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars.          Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defense. Our NATO partners, as an example, were far behind in their defense payments. But at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year. This will ultimately go to $400 billion. Secretary General Stoltenberg, who heads NATO, was amazed, and said that President Trump did what no one else was able to do.          From the moment I left my former life behind, and a good life it was, I have done nothing but fight for YOU.          I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington Politics. I KEPT MY PROMISES.          Together, we have ended the rule of the failed political class – and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. They are angry at me because instead of putting THEM FIRST, I put AMERICA FIRST!          Days after taking office, we shocked the Washington Establishment and withdrew from the last Administration’s job-killing Trans Pacific Partnership. I then approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines, ended the unfair and costly Paris Climate Accord, and secured, for the first time, American Energy Independence. We passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts, at a rate nobody had ever seen before. Within three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world.          Washington insiders asked me NOT to stand up to China – they pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind. But I kept my word to the American People. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest hitting action against China in American History.          They said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace NAFTA – but again, they were wrong. Earlier this year, I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement into law. Now auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in America, not firing their employees and deserting us.          In perhaps no area did the Washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-American immigration. But I refused to back down – and today America’s borders are more secure than EVER before. We ENDED catch-and-release, stopped asylum fraud, took down human traffickers who prey on women and children, and we have deported 20,000 Gang Members and 500,000 Criminal Aliens. We have already built 300 miles of Border Wall – and we are adding 10 new miles every single week. The Wall will soon be complete, and it is working beyond our wildest expectations.          We are joined this evening by members of the Border Patrol union, representing our country’s courageous border agents. Thank you all.          When I learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority laid off hundreds of American Workers and forced them to train their lower-paid foreign replacements, I promptly removed the Chairman of the Board. And now, those talented American Workers have been RE-HIRED and are back providing power to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia. They have their old jobs back, and some are here with us this evening. Please stand.          Last month, I took on Big Pharma and signed orders that will massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs, and to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed the decades long-awaited RIGHT TO TRY legislation. We also passed VA Accountability and VA Choice.          By the end of my first term, we will have approved more than 300 federal judges, including two great new Supreme Court Justices. To bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, the long-term funding of historically black colleges and universities, and, before the China Virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans ever recorded. I have done more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president. I have done more in three years for the black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years—and when I’m reelected, the best is yet to come!          When I took office, the Middle East was in total chaos. ISIS was rampaging, Iran was on the rise, and the war in Afghanistan had no end in sight. I withdrew from the terrible, one-sided Iran Nuclear Deal. Unlike many presidents before me, I kept my promise, recognized Israel’s true capital and moved our Embassy to Jerusalem. But not only did we talk about it as a future site, we got it built. Rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned, we took an already owned existing building in a better location, and opened it at a cost of less than $500,000. We also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and this month we achieved the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years. In addition, we obliterated 100 percent of the ISIS Caliphate, and killed its founder and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Then, in a separate operation, we eliminated the world’s number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani.          Unlike previous administrations, I have kept America OUT of new wars – and our troops are coming home. We have spent nearly $2.5 trillion on completely rebuilding our military, which was very badly depleted when I took office. This includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors. We also launched the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States military since the Air Force was created almost 75 years ago.          We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years.          Biden’s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs. The laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other states didn’t want Joe Biden’s hollow words of empathy, they wanted their jobs back!          As Vice President, he supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the U.S. Auto Industry; he backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted FOR the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as “a positive development” for America and the world. That’s why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win.          China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused.          In recent months, our nation, and the rest of the world, has been hit with a once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders – please stand and accept our profound thanks. Many Americans have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease. As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives so tragically taken. In their honor, we will unite. In their memory, we will overcome.          When the China Virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Invoking the Defense Production Act, we produced the world’s largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. We shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves and gowns to our front line healthcare workers. To protect our nation’s seniors, we rushed supplies, testing kits, and personnel to nursing homes and long term care facilities. The Army Corps of Engineers built field hospitals, and the Navy deployed our great hospital ships.          We developed, from scratch, the largest and most advanced testing system in the world. America has tested more than every country in Europe put together, and more than every nation in the Western Hemisphere COMBINED. We have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation.          We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful anti-body treatment known as Convalescent Plasma that will save thousands of lives. Thanks to advances we have pioneered, the fatality rate has been reduced by 80 percent since April.          The United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. The European Union’s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30 percent greater increase in excess mortality than the United States.          We enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history. Thanks to our Paycheck Protection Program, we have saved or supported more than 50 million American jobs. As a result, we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation, and we are recovering much faster. Over the past three months, we have gained over 9 million jobs, a new record.          Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize. When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died.          Instead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation’s children, families, and citizens of all backgrounds.          The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation and more. Joe Biden’s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather a surrender.          My Administration has a different approach. To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk – especially the elderly – while allowing lower-risk Americans to safely return to work and school.          Most importantly, we are marshalling America’s scientific genius to produce a vaccine in RECORD TIME. Under Operation Warp Speed, we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now, years ahead of what has been achieved before. We are producing them in advance, so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available.          We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year, and together we will crush the virus.          At the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda. But that’s not because they don’t have one. It’s because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee. Joe Biden may claim he is an “ally of the Light,” but when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep you completely in the dark.          He has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families, which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy and once again record stock markets. On the other hand, just as I did in my first term, I will cut taxes even further for hardworking moms and dads, not raise them. We will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China BACK to America – and we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. We’ll make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country, as I’ve already been doing. Joe Biden’s agenda is Made in China. My agenda is MADE IN THE USA.          Biden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas – laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico. Millions of jobs will be lost, and energy prices will soar. These same policies led to crippling power outages in California just last week. How can Joe Biden claim to be an “ally of the Light” when his own party can’t even keep the lights on?          Joe Biden’s campaign has even published a 110-page policy platform co-authored with Far-Left Senator Bernie Sanders. The Biden-Bernie Manifesto calls for suspending ALL removals of illegal aliens, implementing nationwide Catch-and-Release; and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer-funded lawyers. Joe Biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage and promised to give away YOUR healthcare dollars to illegal immigrants. He also supports deadly Sanctuary Cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from Jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. The Biden Plan would eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a global pandemic.          Biden also vowed to oppose School Choice and close down Charter Schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for Black and Hispanic children.          In a second term, I will EXPAND charter schools and provide SCHOOL CHOICE to every family in America. And we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect they deserve.          Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable – yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up to the moment of BIRTH. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby’s beating heart in the 9th month of pregnancy.          Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America’s soul? Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a GOD-GIVEN RIGHT TO LIFE.          During the Democrat Convention, the words “Under God” were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance – not once, but twice. The fact is, this is where they are coming from.          If the left gains power, they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns, and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other Constitutional freedoms.          Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism. If Joe Biden doesn’t have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, then how is he ever going to stand up FOR you?          The most dangerous aspect of the Biden Platform is the attack on public safety. The Biden-Bernie Manifesto calls for Abolishing cash bail, immediately releasing 400,000 criminals onto your streets and into your neighborhoods.          When asked if he supports cutting police funding, Joe Biden replied, “Yes, absolutely.” When Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called the Minneapolis police department a cancer that is “rotten to the root,” Biden wouldn’t disavow her support and reject her endorsement – he proudly displayed it on his website.          Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will Defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden’s America.          My administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. Every day, police officers risk their lives to keep us safe, and every year, many sacrifice their lives in the line of duty.          One of these incredible Americans was Detective Miosotis Familia. She was part of a team of American Heroes called the NYPD or New York’s Finest. Three years ago on Fourth of July weekend, Detective Familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge.          Detective Familia was a single mom – she’d recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids. Two years ago, I stood in front of the U.S. Capitol alongside those children, and held their Grandmother’s hand as they mourned their terrible loss and we honored Detective Familia’s extraordinary life.          Detective Familia’s three children are with us this evening. Genesis, Peter, and Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. I promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever.          We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country are noble, courageous and honorable. We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. They are afraid to act. They are afraid to lose their pension. They are afraid to lose their jobs, and by being afraid they are not able to do their jobs. And those who suffer most are the great people who they want so desperately to protect.          When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will. But what we can never have in America – and must never allow – is MOB RULE. In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York.          There is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America. This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to. We must always have law and order. All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted, and punished to the fullest extent of the law.          When the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments, I signed an order, ten years in prison, and it all stopped.          During their convention, Joe Biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-Run Cities. In the face of left-wing anarchy and mayhem in Minneapolis, Chicago, and other cities, Joe Biden’s campaign did not condemn it – they DONATED to it. At least 13 members of Joe Biden’s campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals, arsonists, looters, and rioters from jail.          Here tonight is the grieving family of retired police Captain David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters. We are honored to be joined tonight by his wife Ann and beloved family members: Brian and Kielen. To each of you: we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain David Dorn.          As long as I am President, I will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity, and peace.          If the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag-burners, that is up to them, but I, as your President, will not be a part of it. The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America Safe.          Last year, over 1,000 African-Americans were murdered as result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats, and have been for decades. Thousands more African-Americans are victims of violent crime in these communities Joe Biden and the left ignore these American Victims. I NEVER WILL.          If the Radical Left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every city, town, and suburb in America.          Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the U.S. Government.          Liberal politicians claim to be concerned about the strength of American institutions. But who, exactly, is attacking them? Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement, and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent? In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by the radical left.          Always Remember: they are coming after ME, because I am fighting for YOU.          We must reclaim our independence from the left’s repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases, and the ever-more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far-left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be FALSE, and scare you out of saying what you know to be TRUE.          But on November 3rd, you can send them a thundering message they will never forget!          Joe Biden is weak. He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage. These same liberals want to eliminate school choice, while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land. They want to open our borders while living in walled-off compounds and communities. They want to defund the police, while they have armed guards for themselves.          This November, we must turn the page FOREVER on this failed political class. The fact is, I’m here, and they’re not – and that’s because of YOU. Together, we will write the next chapter of the Great American Story.          Over the next four years, we will make America into the Manufacturing Superpower of the World. We will expand Opportunity Zones, bring home our medical supply chains, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all.          We will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before.          We will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months.          We will hire MORE police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities.          We will BAN deadly Sanctuary Cities, and ensure that federal healthcare is protected for American Citizens – not illegal aliens.          We will have strong borders, strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America OUT of endless and costly foreign wars.          We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the LAW – not their own political agenda.          We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed.          We will uphold your religious liberty, and defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.          We will protect Medicare and Social Security.          We will always, and very strongly, protect patients with pre-existing conditions, and that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party.          We will END surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums.          We will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain number one in the world, and keep America Energy Independent.          We will win the race to 5G, and build the world’s best cyber and missile defense.          We will fully restore patriotic education to our schools, and always protect free speech on college campuses.          We will launch a new age of American Ambition in Space. America will land the first WOMAN on the moon – and the United States will be the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.          This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country TOGETHER.          So tonight, I say again to all Americans: This is the most important election in the history of our country. There has never been such a difference between two parties, or two individuals, in ideology, philosophy, or vision than there is right now.          Our opponents believe that America is a depraved nation.          We want our sons and daughters to know the truth: America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world!          Our country wasn’t built by cancel culture, speech codes, and soul-crushing conformity. We are NOT a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American Patriots.          We are a nation of pilgrims, pioneers, adventurers, explorers and trailblazers who refused to be tied down, held back, or reined in. Americans have steel in their spines, grit in their souls, and fire in their hearts. There is no one like us on earth.          I want every child in America to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background, in America, ANYONE CAN RISE. With hard work, devotion, and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition.          Our American Ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. They braved the freezing winters, crossed the raging rivers, scaled the rocky peaks, trekked the dangerous forests, and worked from dawn till dusk. These pioneers didn’t have money, they didn’t have fame– but they had each other. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God!          When opportunity beckoned, they picked up their Bibles, packed up their belongings, climbed into covered wagons, and set out West for the next adventure. Ranchers and miners, cowboys and sheriffs, farmers and settlers – they pressed on past the Mississippi to stake a claim in the Wild Frontier.          Legends were born – Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, Davy Crockett, and Buffalo Bill.          Americans built their beautiful homesteads on the Open Range. Soon they had churches and communities, then towns, and with time, great centers of industry and commerce. That is who they were. Americans build the future, we don’t tear down the past!          We are the nation that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the skyscrapers, revolutionized industry, and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature – and we did it all with style, confidence and flair. Because THAT is who we are.          Whenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call.          From Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima, American Patriots raced into cannon blasts, bullets and bayonets to rescue American Liberty.          But America didn’t stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a 6 million pound rocket, and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so that two brave patriots could stand tall and salute our wondrous American flag planted on the face of the Moon.          For America, nothing is impossible.          Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights. And we will show the world that, for America, no dream is beyond our reach.          Together, we are unstoppable. Together, we are unbeatable. Because together, we are the proud CITIZENS of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. And on November 3rd, we will make America safer, we will make America stronger, we will make America prouder, and we will make America GREATER than ever before! Thank you, God Bless You. God Bless America — GOODNIGHT!\"\n",

            "  \"Text\": \"Well, thank you very much. This is incredible.     Media will not show the magnitude of this crowd. Even I, when I turned on today, I looked, and I saw thousands of people here. But you don't see hundreds of thousands of people behind you because they don't want to show that.          We have hundreds of thousands of people here and I just want them to be recognized by the fake news media. Turn your cameras please and show what's really happening out here because these people are not going to take it any longer. They're not going to take it any longer. Go ahead. Turn your cameras, please. Would you show? They came from all over the world, actually, but they came from all over our country.          I just really want to see what they do. I just want to see how they covered. I've never seen anything like it. But it would be really great if we could be covered fairly by the media. The media is the biggest problem we have as far as I'm concerned, single biggest problem. The fake news and the Big tech.          Big tech is now coming into their own. We beat them four years ago. We surprised them. We took them by surprise and this year they rigged an election. They rigged it like they've never rigged an election before. And by the way, last night they didn't do a bad job either if you notice. I'm honest. And I just, again, I want to thank you. It's just a great honor to have this kind of crowd and to be before you and hundreds of thousands of American patriots who are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our glorious republic. All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats, which is what they're doing. And stolen by the fake news media. That's what they've done and what they're doing. We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore and that's what this is all about. And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with: We will stop the steal. Today I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election and we won it by a landslide. This was not a close election. You know, I say, sometimes jokingly, but there's no joke about it: I've been in two elections. I won them both and the second one, I won much bigger than the first. OK. Almost 75 million people voted for our campaign, the most of any incumbent president by far in the history of our country, 12 million more people than four years ago. And I was told by the real pollsters — we do have real pollsters — they know that we were going to do well and we were going to win. What I was told, if I went from 63 million, which we had four years ago, to 66 million, there was no chance of losing. Well, we didn't go to 66, we went to 75 million, and they say we lost. We didn't lose. And by the way, does anybody believe that Joe had 80 million votes? Does anybody believe that? He had 80 million computer votes. It's a disgrace. There's never been anything like that. You could take third-world countries. Just take a look. Take third-world countries. Their elections are more honest than what we've been going through in this country. It's a disgrace. It's a disgrace. Even when you look at last night. They're all running around like chickens with their heads cut off with boxes. Nobody knows what the hell is going on. There's never been anything like this. We will not let them silence your voices. We're not going to let it happen, I'm not going to let it happen. (Audience chants: 'Fight for Trump.') Thank you. And I'd love to have if those tens of thousands of people would be allowed. The military, the secret service. And we want to thank you and the police law enforcement. Great. You're doing a great job. But I'd love it if they could be allowed to come up here with us. Is that possible? Can you just let him come up, please? And Rudy, you did a great job. He's got guts. You know what? He's got guts, unlike a lot of people in the Republican Party. He's got guts. He fights, he fights. And I'll tell you. Thank you very much, John. Fantastic job. I watched. That's a tough act to follow, those two. John is one of the most brilliant lawyers in the country, and he looked at this and he said, 'What an absolute disgrace that this can be happening to our Constitution.' And he looked at Mike Pence, and I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so. Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election. All he has to do, all this is, this is from the number one, or certainly one of the top, Constitutional lawyers in our country. He has the absolute right to do it. We're supposed to protect our country, support our country, support our Constitution, and protect our constitution. States want to revote. The states got defrauded. They were given false information. They voted on it. Now they want to recertify. They want it back. All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president and you are the happiest people. And I actually, I just spoke to Mike. I said: 'Mike, that doesn't take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage.' And then we're stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot and we have to live with that for four more years. We're just not going to let that happen. Many of you have traveled from all across the nation to be here, and I want to thank you for the extraordinary love. That's what it is. There's never been a movement like this, ever, ever. For the extraordinary love for this amazing country, and this amazing movement, thank you. (Audience chants: 'We love Trump.') By the way, this goes all the way back past the Washington Monument. You believe this? Look at this. That is. Unfortunately gave, they gave the press the prime seats. I can't stand that. No. But you look at that behind. I wish they'd flip those cameras and look behind you. That is the most amazing sight. When they make a mistake, you get to see it on television. Amazing. Amazing. All the way back. And don't worry, we will not take the name off the Washington Monument. We will not cancel culture. You know they wanted to get rid of the Jefferson Memorial. Either take it down or just put somebody else in there. I don't think that's going to happen. It damn well better not. Although, with this administration, if this happens, it could happen. You'll see some really bad things happen. They'll knock out Lincoln too, by the way. They've been taking his statue down. But then we signed a little law. You hurt our monuments, you hurt our heroes, you go to jail for 10 years, and everything stopped. You notice that? It stopped. It all stopped. And they could use Rudy back in New York City. Rudy. They could use you. Your city's going to hell. They want Rudy Giuliani back in New York. We'll get a little younger version of Rudy. Is that OK, Rudy? We're gathered together in the heart of our nation's capital for one very, very basic and simple reason: To save our democracy. You know most candidates on election evening and, of course, this thing goes on so long. They still don't have any idea what the votes are. We still have congressional seats under review. They have no idea. They've totally lost control. They've used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people in a proper election. But you know, you know, when you see this and when you see what's happening. Number one, they all say, 'Sir, we'll never let it happen again.' I said, 'That's good. But what about eight weeks ago?' You know they try and get you to go. They said, 'Sir, in four years, you're guaranteed.' I said: 'I'm not interested right now. Do me a favor, go back eight weeks. I want to go back eight weeks. Let's go back eight weeks.' We want to go back and we want to get this right because we're going to have somebody in there that should not be in there and our country will be destroyed and we're not going to stand for that. For years, Democrats have gotten away with election fraud and weak Republicans. And that's what they are. There's so many weak Republicans. And we have great ones. Jim Jordan and some of these guys, they're out there fighting. The House guys are fighting. But it's, it's incredible. Many of the Republicans, I helped them get in, I helped them get elected. I helped Mitch get elected. I helped. I could name 24 of them, let's say, I won't bore you with it. And then all of a sudden you have something like this. It's like, 'Oh gee, maybe I'll talk to the president sometime later.' No, it's amazing. They're weak Republicans, they're pathetic Republicans and that's what happens. If this happened to the Democrats, there'd be hell all over the country going on. There'd be hell all over the country. But just remember this: You're stronger, you're smarter, you've got more going than anybody. And they try and demean everybody having to do with us. And you're the real people, you're the people that built this nation. You're not the people that tore down our nation. The weak Republicans, and that's it. I really believe it. I think I'm going to use the term, the weak Republicans. You've got a lot of them. And you got a lot of great ones. But you got a lot of weak ones. They've turned a blind eye, even as Democrats enacted policies that chipped away our jobs, weakened our military, threw open our borders and put America last. Did you see the other day where Joe Biden said, I want to get rid of the America First policy? What's that all about? Get rid of. How do you say I want to get rid of America First? Even if you're going to do it, don't talk about it, right? Unbelievable what we have to go through. What we have to go through. And you have to get your people to fight. And if they don't fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don't fight. You primary them. We're going to. We're going to let you know who they are. I can already tell you, frankly. But this year, using the pretext of the China virus and the scam of mail-in ballots, Democrats attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft and there's never been anything like this. So pure theft in American history. Everybody knows it. That election, our election was over at 10 o'clock in the evening. We're leading Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, by hundreds of thousands of votes. And then late in the evening, or early in the morning, boom, these explosions of bull****. And all of a sudden. All of a sudden it started to happen. (Audience chants: 'Bull****.') Don't forget when Romney got beat. Romney, hey. Did you see his? I wonder if he enjoyed his flight in last night. But when Romney got beaten, you know, he stands up like you're more typical, 'Well, I'd like to congratulate the victor.' The victor? Who is the victor, Mitt? 'I'd like to congratulate.' They don't go and look at the facts. No, I don't know. He got, he got slaughtered. Probably, maybe it was OK, maybe it was. But that's what happened. But we look at the facts and our election was so corrupt that in the history of this country we've never seen anything like it. You can go all the way back. You know, America is blessed with elections. All over the world they talk about our elections. You know what the world says about us now? They said, we don't have free and fair elections. And you know what else? We don't have a free and fair press. Our media is not free, it's not fair. It suppresses thought, it suppresses speech and it's become the enemy of the people. It's become the enemy of the people. It's the biggest problem we have in this country. No third-world countries would even attempt to do what we caught them doing. And you'll hear about that in just a few minutes. Republicans are, Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It's like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we're going to have to fight much harder. And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn't, that will be a, a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold our Constitution. Now, it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we're going to walk down, and I'll be there with you, we're going to walk down, we're going to walk down. Anyone you want, but I think right here, we're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. Because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated. I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. Today we will see whether Republicans stand strong for integrity of our elections. But whether or not they stand strong for our country, our country. Our country has been under siege for a long time. Far longer than this four-year period. We've set it on a much greater course. So much, and we, I thought, you know, four more years. I thought it would be easy. We've created the greatest economy in history. We rebuilt our military. We get you the biggest tax cuts in history. Right? We got you the biggest regulation cuts. There's no president, whether it's four years, eight years or in one case more, got anywhere near the regulation cuts. Used to take 20 years to get a highway approved, now we're down to two. I want to get it down to one, but we're down to two. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we got it down to safety. We created Space Force, We, we, we. Look at what we did. Our military has been totally rebuilt. So we create Space Force which, by and of itself, is a major achievement for an administration. And with us it's one of so many different things. Right to Try. Everybody know about Right to Try. We did things that nobody ever thought possible. We took care of our vets, our vets. The VA now has the highest rating, 91%. The highest rating that it's had from the beginning, 91% approval rating. Always, you watch the VA, it was on television every night, people living in a horrible, horrible manner. We got that done. We got accountability done. We got it so that now in the VA, you don't have to wait for four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks, four months to see a doctor. If you can't get a doctor, you go outside, you get the doctor. You have it taken care of and we pay the doctor. And we've not only made life wonderful for so many people, we've saved tremendous amounts of money, far secondarily, but we've saved a lot of money. And now we have the right to fire bad people in the VA. We had 9,000 people that treated our veterans horribly. In primetime, they would not have treated our veterans badly. But they treated our veterans horribly. And we have what's called the account, VA Accountability Act. And the accountability says if we see somebody in there that doesn't treat our vets well or they steal, they rob, they do things badly, we say: 'Joe you're fired. Get out of here.' Before you couldn't do that. You couldn't do that before. So we've taken care of things, we've done things like nobody's ever thought possible. And that's part of the reason that many people don't like us, because we've done too much. But we've done it quickly and we were going to sit home and watch a big victory and everybody had us down for a victory. It was going to be great and now we're out here fighting. I said to somebody, I was going to take a few days and relax after our big electoral victory. 10 o'clock it was over. But I was going to take a few days. And I can say this. Since our election, I believe, which was such a catastrophe, when I watch. And even these guys knew what happened. They know what happened. They're saying: 'Wow, Pennsylvania's insurmountable. Wow, Wisconsin.' Look at the big leads we had, right. Even though the press said we would lose Wisconsin by 17 points. Even though the press said, Ohio's going to be close, we set a record; Florida's going to be close, we set a record; Texas is going to be close, Texas is going to be close, we set a record. And we set a record with Hispanic, with the Black community, we set a record with everybody. Today we see a very important event though. Because right over there, right there, we see the event going to take place. And I'm going to be watching. Because history is going to be made. We're going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders, or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eternity they'll be ashamed. And you know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should never, ever forget that they did. Never forget. We should never ever forget. With only three of the seven states in question, we win the presidency of the United States. And by the way, it's much more important today than it was 24 hours ago, because I don't. I spoke to David Perdue, what a great person, and Kelly Loeffler, two great people, but it was a setup. And you know, I said, 'We have no backline anymore.' The only backline, the only line of demarcation, the only line that we have is the veto of the president of the United States. So this is now, what we're doing, a far more important election than it was two days ago. I want to thank the more than 140 members of the House. Those are warriors. They're over there working like you've never seen before. Studying, talking, actually going all the way back, studying the roots of the Constitution, because they know we have the right to send a bad vote that was illegally gotten. They gave these people bad things to vote for and they voted because what did they know? And then when they found out a few weeks later, again, it took them four years to devise this screen. And the only unhappy person in the United States, single most unhappy, is Hillary Clinton. Because she said: 'Why didn't you do this for me four years ago? Why didn't you do this for me four years ago? Change the votes, 10,000 in Michigan. You could have changed the whole thing.' But she's not too happy. You know, you don't see her anymore. What happened? Where's Hillary? Where is she? But I want to thank all of those congressmen and women. I also want to thank our 13, most courageous members of the U.S. Senate. Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Josh Hawley, Kelly Loeffler. And Kelly Loeffler, I'll tell you, she has been, she's been so great. She worked so hard. So let's give her and David a little special hand because it was rigged against them. Let's give her and David. Kelly Loeffler, David Purdue. They fought a good race. They never had a shot. That equipment should never have been allowed to be used, and I was telling these people don't let him use this stuff. Marsha Blackburn, terrific person. Mike Braun, Indiana. Steve Daines, great guy. Bill Hagerty, John Kennedy, James Lankford, Cynthia Lummis, Tommy Tuberville, the coach, and Roger Marshall. We want to thank them. Senators that stepped up, we want to thank them. I actually think though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up, and I think a lot of those people are going to find that out and you better start looking at your leadership, because your leadership has led you down the tubes. You know, we don't want to give $2,000 to people. We want to give them $600. Oh, great. How does that play politically? Pretty good? And this has nothing to do with politics, but how does it play politically? China destroyed these people. We didn't destroy. China destroy them, totally destroyed them. We want to give them $600 and they just wouldn't change. I said give them $2,000, we'll pay it back. We'll pay it back fast. You already owe 26 trillion, give them a couple of bucks. Let them live. Give them a couple of bucks. And some of the people here disagree with me on that, but I just say, 'Look, you've got to let people live.' And how does that play though? OK. Number one, it's the right thing to do. But how does that play politically? I think it's the primary reason, one of the primary reasons, the other was just pure cheating. That was the primary, super primary reason. But you can't do that, you got to use your head. As you know, the media has constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Have you ever seen these people? While there is no evidence of fraud. Oh, really? Well, I'm going to read you pages. I hope you don't get bored listening to it. Promise? Don't get bored listening to it, all those hundreds of thousands of people back there. Move them up, please, yeah. All they, all these people, don't get bored, don't get angry at me because you're going to get bored because it's so much. The American people do not believe the corrupt, fake news anymore. They have ruined their reputation. But you know, it used to be that they'd argue with me. I'd fight. So I'd fight, they'd fight, I'd fight, they'd fight. Pop pop. You'd believe me, you'd believe them. Somebody comes out. You know, they had their point of view, I had my point of view, but you'd have an argument. Now what they do is they go silent. It's called suppression and that's what happens in a communist country. That's what they do, they suppress. You don't fight with them anymore. Unless it's a bad story. They have a little bad story about me, they make it 10 times worse and it's a major headline. But Hunter Biden, they don't talk about him. What happened to Hunter? Where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? They don't talk about him. They'll watch, all the sets will go off. Well, they can't do that because they get good ratings. Their ratings are too good. Now, where's Hunter? You know. And how come Joe is allowed to give a billion dollars of money to get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine? How does that happen? I'd ask you that question. How does that happen? Can you imagine if I said that? If I said that it would be a whole different ballgame. And how come Hunter gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife, and gets hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on an energy board, even though he admits he has no knowledge of energy? And millions of dollars up front. And how come they go into China and they leave with billions of dollars to manage. 'Have you managed money before?' 'No, I haven't.' 'Oh, that's good. Here's about 3 billion.' No, they don't talk about that. No, we have a corrupt media. They've gone silent. They've gone dead. I now realize how good it was if you go back 10 years, I realized how good, even though I didn't necessarily love them, I realized how good. It was like a cleansing motion, right? But we don't have that anymore. We don't have a fair media anymore. It's suppression. And you have to be very careful with that and they've lost all credibility in this country. We will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the lies that we've been forced to believe. Over the past several weeks, we've amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election. This is the presidential election. Last night was a little bit better because of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state, but they cheated like hell anyway. You have one of the dumbest governors in the United States. And you know when I endorsed him, and I didn't know this guy, at the request of David Perdue, he said, 'Friend of mine's running for governor.' 'What's his name?' And you know the rest. He was in fourth place, fifth place. I don't know, he was, he was doing poorly. I endorse him, he went like a rocket ship and he won. And then I had to beat Stacey Abrams with this guy, Brian Kemp. I had to beat Stacey Abrams. And I had to beat Oprah, used to be a friend of mine. You know, I was on her last show, her last week, she picked the five outstanding people. I don't think she thinks that any more. Once I ran for president, I didn't notice there were too many calls coming in from Oprah. Believe it or not, she used to like me. But I was one of the five outstanding people. And I had a campaign against Michelle Obama and Barack Hussein Obama, against Stacey. And I had Brian Kemp, who weighs 130 pounds. He said he played offensive line in football. I'm trying to figure that out. I'm still trying to figure that out. He said that the other night, 'I was an offensive lineman.' I'm saying: 'Really? That must have been a very small team.' But I look at that and I look at what's happened and he turned out to be a disaster. This stuff happens. You know, look, I'm not happy with the Supreme Court. They love to rule against me. I picked three people. I fought like hell for them. One in particular, I fought. They all said, 'Sir, cut him loose.' He's killing the senators. You know, very loyal senators, they're very loyal people, 'Sir, cut him loose, he's killing us, sir, cut him loose.' I must have gotten half of the senators. I said: 'No, I can't do that, it's unfair to him and it's unfair to the family. He didn't do anything wrong.' They made up stories, they're all made-up stories. He didn't do anything wrong. 'Cut him loose, sir.' I said, 'No, I won't do that. We got him through.' And you know what, they couldn't give a damn. They couldn't give a damn. Let him rule the right way. But it almost seems that they're all going out of their way to hurt all of us and to hurt our country. To hurt our country. You know, I read a story in one of the newspapers recently how I control the three Supreme Court justices. I control them. They're puppets. I read it about Bill Barr, that he's my personal attorney. That he'll do anything for me. And I said, 'You know, it really is genius.' Because what they do is that, and it makes it really impossible for them to ever give you a victory, because all of a sudden Bill Barr changed. If you hadn't noticed. I like Bill Barr, but he changed, because he didn't want to be considered my personal attorney. And the Supreme Court, they rule against me so much. You know why? Because the story is — I haven't spoken to any of them, any of them, since virtually they got in — but the story is that they're my puppets. Right? That they're puppets. And now the only way they can get out of that because they hate that it's not good in the social circuit. And the only way they get out is to rule against Trump. So let's rule against Trump. And they do that. So I want to congratulate them. But it shows you the media's genius. In fact, probably if I was the media, I'd do it the same way. I hate to say it. But we got to get them straightened out. Today, for the sake of our democracy, for the sake of our Constitution, and for the sake of our children, we lay out the case for the entire world to hear. You want to hear it? (Audience responds: 'Yeah') In every single swing state, local officials, state officials, almost all Democrats, made illegal and unconstitutional changes to election procedures without the mandated approvals by the state legislatures. That these changes paved a way for fraud on a scale never seen before. I think we go a long way outside of our country when I say that. So, just in a nutshell, you can't make a change or voting for a federal election unless the state legislature approves it. No judge can do it. Nobody can do it. Only a legislature. So as an example, in Pennsylvania, or whatever, you have a Republican legislature, you have a Democrat mayor, and you have a lot of Democrats all over the place. They go to the legislature. The legislature laughs at them, says we're not going to do that. They say, thank you very much and they go and make the changes themselves, they do it anyway. And that's totally illegal. That's totally illegal. You can't do that. In Pennsylvania, the Democrat secretary of state and the Democrat state Supreme Court justices illegally abolished the signature verification requirements just 11 days prior to the election. So think of what they did. No longer is there signature verification. Oh, that's OK. We want voter ID by the way. But no longer is there a signature verification. Eleven days before the election they say we don't want it. You know why they don't want to? Because they want to cheat. That's the only reason. Who would even think of that? We don't want to verify a signature? There were over 205,000 more ballots counted in Pennsylvania. Think of this, you had 205,000 more ballots than you had voters. That means you had two. Where did they come from? You know where they came from? Somebody's imagination, whatever they needed. So in Pennsylvania, you had 205,000 more votes than you had voters. And the number is actually much greater than that now. That was as of a week ago. And this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to say it's a total fraud. So Pennsylvania was defrauded. Over 8,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match individuals who died in 2020 and prior to the election. Think of that. Dead people, lots of dead people, thousands. And some dead people actually requested an application. That bothers me even more. Not only are they voting, they want an application to vote. One of them was 29 years ago, died. It's incredible. Over 14,000 ballots were cast by out-of-state voters, so these are voters that don't live in this state. And by the way, these numbers are what they call outcome-determinative, meaning these numbers far surpass. I lost by a very little bit. These numbers are massive, massive. More than 10,000 votes in Pennsylvania were illegally counted, even though they were received after Election Day. In other words, they were received after Election Day. Let's count them anyway. And what they did in many cases is, they did fraud. They took the date and they moved it back so that it no longer is after Election Day. And more than 60,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were reported received back. They got back before they were ever supposedly mailed out. In other words, you got the ballot back before you mailed it, which is also logically and logistically impossible, right? Think of that one. You got the ballot back. Let's send the ballots. Oh, they've already been sent. But we got the ballot back before they were sent. I don't think that's too good, right? Twenty-five thousand ballots in Pennsylvania were requested by nursing home residents, all in a single giant batch, not legal, indicating an enormous, illegal ballot harvesting operation. You're not allowed to do it, it's against the law. The day before the election, the state of Pennsylvania reported the number of absentee ballots that had been sent out. Yet this number was suddenly and drastically increased by 400,000 people. It was increased, nobody knows where it came from, by 400,000 ballots, one day after the election. It remains totally unexplained. They said, 'Well, ah, we can't figure that.' Now, that's many, many times what it would take to overthrow the state. Just that one element. Four hundred thousand ballots appeared from nowhere right after the election. By the way, Pennsylvania has now seen all of this. They didn't know because it was so quick. They had a vote. They voted. But now they see all this stuff, it's all come to light. Doesn't happen that fast. And they want to recertify their votes. They want to recertify. But the only way that can happen is if Mike Pence agrees to send it back. Mike Pence has to agree to send it back. (Audience chants: 'Send it back.') And many people in Congress want it sent back. And think of what you're doing. Let's say you don't do it. Somebody says, 'Well, we have to obey the Constitution.' And you are, because you're protecting our country and you're protecting the Constitution. So you are. But think of what happens. Let's say they're stiffs and they're stupid people, and they say, well, we really have no choice. Even though Pennsylvania and other states want to redo their votes. They want to see the numbers. They already have the numbers. Go very quickly. And they want to redo their legislature because many of these votes were taken, as I said, because it wasn't approved by their legislature. You know, that, in itself, is legal. And then you have the scam, and that's all of the things that we're talking about. But think of this. If you don't do that, that means you will have a president of the United States for four years, with his wonderful son. You will have a president who lost all of these states. Or you will have a president, to put it another way, who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these states. You will have an illegitimate president. That's what you'll have. And we can't let that happen. These are the facts that you won't hear from the fake news media. It's all part of the suppression effort. They don't want to talk about it. They don't want to talk about it. In fact, when I started talking about that, I guarantee you, a lot of the television sets and a lot of those cameras went off. And that's a lot of cameras back there. But a lot of them went off. But these are the things you don't hear about. You don't hear what you just heard. I'm going to go over a few more states. But you don't hear it by the people who want to deceive you and demoralize you and control you. Big tech, media. Just like the suppression polls that said we're going lose Wisconsin by 17 points. Well, we won Wisconsin. They don't have it that way because they lost just by a little sliver. But they had me down the day before, Washington Post/ABC poll, down 17 points. I called up a real pollster. I said, 'What is that?' 'Sir, that's called a suppression poll. I think you're going to win Wisconsin, sir.' I said, 'But why don't they make it four or five points?' Because then people vote. But when you're down 17, they say, 'Hey, I'm not going to waste my time. I love the president, but there's no way.' Despite that, despite that, we won Wisconsin. It's going to see. I mean, you'll see. But that's called suppression because a lot of people when they see that. It's very interesting. This pollster said, 'Sir, if you're down three, four, or five people vote. When you go down 17, they say, 'Let's save. Let's go and have dinner and let's watch the presidential defeat tonight on television, darling.'' And just like the radical left tries to blacklist you on social media. Every time I put out a tweet, that's, even if it's totally correct, totally correct, I get a flag. I get a flag. And they also don't let you get out. You know, on Twitter, it's very hard to come onto my account. It's very hard to get out a message. They don't let the message get out nearly like they should. But I've had many people say, 'I can't get on your Twitter.' I don't care about Twitter. Twitter's bad news. They're all bad news. But you know what, if you want to, if you want to get out a message and if you want to go through Big tech, social media, they are really, if you're a conservative, if you're a Republican, if you have a big voice, I guess they call it shadow banned, right? Shadow banned. They shadow ban you, and it should be illegal. I've been telling these Republicans, get rid of Section 230. And for some reason, Mitch and the group, they don't want to put it in there and they don't realize that that's going to be the end of the Republican Party as we know it, but it's never going to be the end of us. Never. Let them get out. Let, let the weak ones get out. This is a time for strength. They also want to indoctrinate your children in school by teaching them things that aren't so. They want to indoctrinate your children. It's all part of the comprehensive assault on our democracy, and the American people are finally standing up and saying no. This crowd is, again, a testament to it. I did no advertising, I did nothing. You do have some groups that are big supporters. I want to thank that, Amy, and everybody. We have some incredible supporters, incredible. But we didn't do anything. This just happened. Two months ago, we had a massive crowd come down to Washington. I said, 'What are they there for?' 'Sir, they're there for you.' We have nothing to do with it. These groups are for, they're forming all over the United States. And we got to remember, in a year from now, you're going to start working on Congress and we got to get rid of the weak Congress, people, the ones that aren't any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world. We got to get rid of them. We got to get rid. You know, she never wants a soldier brought home — I brought a lot of our soldiers home. I don't know, somewhat like it. They're in countries that nobody even knows the name, nobody knows where they are. They're dying. They're great, but they're dying. They're losing their arms, their legs, their face. I brought them back home, largely back home. Afghanistan, Iraq. Remember, I used to say in the old days: 'Don't go in Iraq. But if you go in, keep the oil.' We didn't keep the oil. So stupid. So stupid these people. And Iraq has billions and billions of dollars now in the bank. And what did we do? We got nothing. We never get. But we do actually, we kept the oil here or we get, we did good. We got rid of the ISIS caliphate. We got rid of plenty of different things that everybody knows and the rebuilding of our military in three years. People said it couldn't be done. And it was all made in the USA, all made in the USA, best equipment in the world. In Wisconsin, corrupt Democrat-run cities deployed more than 500 illegal, unmanned, unsecured drop boxes, which collected a minimum of 91,000 unlawful votes. It was razor-thin, the loss. This one thing alone is much more than we would need. But there are many things. They have these lockboxes. And, you know, they'd pick them up and they disappear for two days. People would say where's that box? They disappeared. Nobody even knew where the hell it was. In addition, over 170,000 absentee votes were counted in Wisconsin without a valid absentee ballot application. So they had a vote, but they had no application, and that's illegal in Wisconsin. Meaning those votes were blatantly done in opposition to state law and they came 100% from Democrat areas such as Milwaukee and Madison, 100%. In Madison, 17,000 votes were deposited in so-called human drop boxes. You know what that is, right? Where operatives stuff thousands of unsecured ballots into duffle bags on park benches across the city, in complete defiance of cease-and-desist letters from state legislature. Your state legislatures said don't do it. They're the only ones that can approve it. They gave tens of thousands of votes. They came in in duffle bags. Where the hell did they come from? According to eyewitness testimony, Postal Service workers in Wisconsin were also instructed to illegally backdate approximately 100,000 ballots. The margin of difference in Wisconsin was less than 20,000 votes. Each one of these things alone wins us the state. Great state. We love the state. We won the state. In Georgia, your secretary of state who, I can't believe this guy's a Republican. He loves recording telephone conversations. You know, that was? I thought it was a great conversation personally. So did a lot of other. People love that conversation because it says what's going on. These people are crooked. They're 100%, in my opinion, one of the most corrupt, between your governor and your secretary of state. And now you have it again last night. Just take a look at what happened. What a mess. And the Democrat Party operatives entered into an illegal and unconstitution — unconstitutional settlement agreement that drastically weakened signature verification and other election security procedures. Stacey Abrams. She took them to lunch. And I beat her two years ago with a bad candidate, Brian Kemp. But they took, the Democrats took the Republicans to lunch because the secretary of state had no clue what the hell was happening. Unless he did have a clue. That's interesting. Maybe he was with the other side. But we've been trying to get verifications of signatures in Fulton County, they won't let us do it. The only reason they won't is because we'll find things in the hundreds of thousands. Why wouldn't they let us verify signatures in Fulton County, which is known for being very corrupt. They won't do it. They go to some other county where you would live. I said, 'That's not the problem.' The problem is Fulton County, home of Stacey Abrams. She did a good job, I congratulate her. But it was done in such a way that we can't let this stuff happen. We won't have a country if it happens. As a result, Georgia's absentee ballot rejection rate was more than 10 times lower than previous levels because the criteria was so off. Forty-eight counties in Georgia, with thousands and thousands of votes, rejected zero ballots. There wasn't one ballot. In other words, in a year in which more mail-in ballots were sent than ever before, and more people were voting by mail for the first time, the rejection rate was drastically lower than it had ever been before. The only way this can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate votes were added to the tally. That's the only way you could explain it. By the way, you're talking about tens of thousands. If Georgia had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots as in other years, they should have been approximately 45,000 ballots rejected. Far more than what we needed to win, just over 11,000. They should find those votes. They should absolutely find that. Just over 11,000 votes, that's all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia, and we're not going to forget it. There's only one reason the Democrats could possibly want to eliminate signature matching, opposed voter ID, and stop citizenship confirmation. 'Are you a citizenship?' You're not allowed to ask that question, because they want to steal the election. The radical left knows exactly what they're doing. They're ruthless and it's time that somebody did something about it. And Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I'm not hearing good stories. In Fulton County, Republican poll watchers were ejected, in some cases, physically from the room under the false pretense of a pipe burst. Water main burst, everybody leave. Which we now know was a total lie. Then election officials pull boxes, Democrats, and suitcases of ballots out from under a table. You all saw it on television, totally fraudulent. And illegally scanned them for nearly two hours, totally unsupervised. Tens of thousands of votes. This act coincided with a mysterious vote dump of up to 100,000 votes for Joe Biden, almost none for Trump. Oh, that sounds fair. That was at 1:34 a.m. The Georgia secretary of state and pathetic governor of Georgia, have reached, although he says I'm a great president. You know, I sort of maybe have to change. He said the other day, 'Yes, I do. I disagree with president, but he's been a great president.' Good, thanks. Thank you very much. Because of him and others, you have Brian Kemp. Vote him the hell out of office, please. Well, his rates are so low. You know, his approval rating now, I think it just reached a record low. They've rejected five separate appeals for an independent and comprehensive audit of signatures in Fulton County. Even without an audit, the number of fraudulent ballots that we've identified across the state is staggering. Over 10,300 ballots in Georgia were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Georgia residents who died in 2020 and prior to the election. More than 2,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match incarcerated felons in Georgia prison. People who are not allowed to vote. More than 4,500 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state's own voter rolls. Over 18,000 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant, according to the Postal Service. At least 88,000 ballots in Georgia were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated. Sixty-six thousand votes, each one of these is far more than we need. Sixty-six thousand votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age. And at least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to November 3 election. They say they moved right back. They moved right back. Oh, they moved out, they moved right back. OK. They missed Georgia that much. I do. I love Georgia, but it's a corrupt system. Despite all of this, the margin in Georgia is only 11,779 votes. Each and every one of these issues is enough to give us a victory in Georgia, a big beautiful victory. Make no mistake, this election was stolen from you, from me and from the country. And not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots. This should absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified. In the state of Arizona, over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens. Two thousand ballots were returned with no address. More than 22,000 ballots were returned before they were ever supposedly mailed out. They returned, but we haven't mailed them yet. Eleven thousand six hundred more ballots and votes were counted, more than there were actual voters. You see that? So you have more votes again than you have voters. One hundred and fifty thousand people registered in Maricopa County after the registration deadline. One hundred and three thousand ballots in the county were sent for electronic adjudication with no Republican observers. In Clark County, Nevada, the accuracy settings on signature verification machines were purposely lowered before they were used to count over 130,000 ballots. If you signed your name as Santa Claus, it would go through. There were also more than 42,000 double votes in Nevada. Over 150,000 people were hurt so badly by what took place. And 1,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Nevada residents who died in 2020 prior to November 3 election. More than 8,000 votes were cast by individuals who had no address and probably didn't live there. The margin in Nevada is down at a very low number, any of these things would have taken care of the situation. We would have won Nevada, also. Every one of these we're going over, we win. In Michigan, quickly, the secretary of state, a real great one, flooded the state with unsolicited mail-in ballot applications sent to every person on the rolls in direct violation of state law. More than 17,000 Michigan ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match people who were deceased. In Wayne County, that's a great one. That's Detroit. One hundred and seventy-four thousand ballots were counted without being tied to an actual registered voter. Nobody knows where they came from. Also, in Wayne County, poll watchers observed canvassers rescanning batches of ballots over and over again, up to three or four or five times. In Detroit, turnout was 139% of registered voters. Think of that. So you had 139% of the people in Detroit voting. This is in Michigan. Detroit, Michigan. A career employee of the Detroit, City of Detroit, testified under penalty of perjury that she witnessed city workers coaching voters to vote straight Democrat while accompanying them to watch who they voted for. When a Republican came in, they wouldn't talk to him. The same worker was instructed not to ask for any voter ID and not to attempt to validate any signatures if they were Democrats. She also told to illegally, and was told, backdate ballots received after the deadline and reports that thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated. That's Michigan. Four witnesses have testified under penalty of perjury that after officials in Detroit announced the last votes had been counted, tens of thousands of additional ballots arrived without required envelopes. Every single one was for a Democrat. I got no votes. At 6:31 a.m. in the early morning hours after voting had ended, Michigan suddenly reported 147,000 votes. An astounding 94% went to Joe Biden, who campaigned brilliantly from his basement. Only a couple of percentage points went to Trump. Such gigantic and one-sided vote dumps were only observed in a few swing states and they were observed in the states where it was necessary. You know what's interesting? President Obama beat Biden in every state other than the swing states where Biden killed them, but the swing states were the ones that mattered. They're always just enough to push Joe Biden barely into the lead. We were ahead by a lot and within a number of hours we were losing by a little. In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion Voting Systems. In one Michigan county alone, 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country. Senator William Ligon, a great gentleman, chairman of Georgia's senate judiciary subcommittee. Senator Ligon, highly respected, on elections has written a letter describing his concerns with Dominion in Georgia. He wrote, and I quote, The Dominion Voting Machines employed in Fulton County had an astronomical and astounding 93.67% error rate. It's only wrong 93% of the time in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter's interest in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 113,000. Think of it. You go in and you vote and then they tell people who you supposed to be voting for. They make up whatever they want. Nobody's ever even heard. They adjudicate your vote. They say, Well, we don't think Trump wants to vote for Trump. We think he wants to vote for Biden. Put it down for Biden. The national average for such an error rate is far less than 1% and yet you're at 93%. The source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up or destroyed to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter. The letter continues. There is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from President Trump to former Vice President Biden in several counties in Georgia. For example, in Bibb County, President Trump was reported to have 29,391 votes at 9:11 p.m. Eastern time, while simultaneously Vice President Joe Biden was reported to have 17,213. Minutes later, just minutes, at the next update, these vote numbers switched with President Trump going way down to 17,000 and Biden going way up to 29,391. And that was very quick, a 12,000 vote switch all in Mr. Biden's favor. So, I mean, I could go on and on about this fraud that took place in every state, and all of these legislatures want this back. I don't want to do it to you because I love you and it's freezing out here. But I could just go on forever. I can tell you this. (Audience chants: 'We love you.') So when you hear, when you hear, while there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing, this is the most fraudulent thing anybody has, this is a criminal enterprise. This is a criminal enterprise. And the press will say, and I'm sure they won't put any of that on there, because that's no good. And you ever see, while there is no evidence to back President Trump's assertion. I could go on for another hour reading this stuff to you and telling you about it. There's never been anything like it. Think about it. Detroit had more votes than it had voters. Pennsylvania had 205,000 more votes than it had more. But you don't have to go any. Between that, I think that's almost better than dead people if you think, right? More votes than they had voters. And many other states also. It's a disgrace that the United States of America, tens of millions of people, are allowed to go vote without so much as even showing identification. In no state is there any question or effort made to verify the identity, citizenship, residency or eligibility of the votes cast. The Republicans have to get tougher. You're not going to have a Republican Party if you don't get tougher. They want to play so straight. They want to play so, sir, yes, the United States. The Constitution doesn't allow me to send them back to the States. Well, I say, yes it does, because the Constitution says you have to protect our country and you have to protect our Constitution, and you can't vote on fraud. And fraud breaks up everything, doesn't it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do. And I hope he doesn't listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he's listening to. It is also widely understood that the voter rolls are crammed full of non-citizens, felons and people who have moved out of state and individuals who are otherwise ineligible to vote. Yet Democrats oppose every effort to clean up their voter rolls. They don't want to clean them up. They're loaded. And how many people here know other people, that when there are hundreds of thousands and then millions of ballots got sent out, got three, four, five, six, and I heard one, who got seven ballots. And then they say you didn't quite make it, sir. We won in a landslide. This was a landslide. They said it's not American to challenge the election. This the most corrupt election in the history, maybe of the world. You know, you could go third-world countries, but I don't think they had hundreds of thousands of votes and they don't have voters for them. I mean no matter where you go, nobody would think this. In fact, it's so egregious, it's so bad that a lot of people don't even believe it. It's so crazy that people don't even believe it. It can't be true. So they don't believe it. This is not just a matter of domestic politics — this is a matter of national security. So today, in addition to challenging the certification of the election, I'm calling on Congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms, and you better do it before we have no country left. Today is not the end, it's just the beginning. With your help over the last four years, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country and nobody even challenges that. I say that over and over, and I never get challenged by the fakeness, and they challenge almost everything we say. But our fight against the big donors, big media, big tech, and others is just getting started. This is the greatest in history. There's never been a movement like that. You look back there all the way to the Washington Monument. It's hard to believe. We must stop the steal and then we must ensure that such outrageous election fraud never happens again, can never be allowed to happen again. But we're going forward. We'll take care of going forward. We've got to take care of going back. Don't let them talk. OK, well, we promised. I've had a lot of people. Sir, you're at 96% for four years. I said I'm not interested right now. I'm interested in right there. With your help, we will finally pass powerful requirements for voter ID. You need an ID to cash a check. You need an ID to go to a bank, to buy alcohol, to drive a car. Every person should need to show an ID in order to cast your most important thing, a vote. We will also require proof of American citizenship in order to vote in American elections. We just had a good victory in court on that one, actually. We will ban ballot harvesting and prohibit the use of unsecured drop boxes to commit rampant fraud. These drop boxes are fraudulent. Therefore, they get disapp — they disappear, and then all of a sudden they show up. It's fraudulent. We will stop the practice of universal unsolicited mail-in balloting. We will clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who casts a vote is a citizen of our country, a resident of the state in which they vote and their vote is cast in a lawful and honest manner. We will restore the vital civic tradition of in-person voting on Election Day so that voters can be fully informed when they make their choice. We will finally hold big tech accountable. And if these people had courage and guts, they would get rid of Section 230, something that no other company, no other person in America, in the world has. All of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their power and interfere in our elections, and it has to be stopped. And the Republicans have to get a lot tougher, and so should the Democrats. They should be regulated, investigated, and brought to justice under the fullest extent of the law. They're totally breaking the law. Together, we will drain the Washington swamp and we will clean up the corruption in our nation's capital. We have done a big job on it, but you think it's easy. It's a dirty business. It's a dirty business. You have a lot of bad people out there. Despite everything we've been through, looking out all over this country and seeing fantastic crowds. Although this, I think, is our all-time record. I think you have 250,000 people. 250,000. Looking out at all the amazing patriots here today, I have never been more confident in our nation's future. Well, I have to say, we have to be a little bit careful. That's a nice statement, but we have to be a little careful with that statement. If we allow this group of people to illegally take over our country because it's illegal when the votes are illegal when the way they got there is illegal when the states that vote are given false and fraudulent information. We are the greatest country on Earth and we are headed and were headed in the right direction. You know, the wall is built. We're doing record numbers at the wall. Now, they want to take down the wall. Let's let everyone flow in. Let's let everybody flow in. We did a great job in the wall. Remember, the wall, they said it could never be done. One of the largest infrastructure projects we've ever had in this country, and it's had a tremendous impact, that we got rid of catch and release. We got rid of all of this stuff that we had to live with. But now, the caravans, I think Biden's getting in, the caravans are forming again. They want to come in again and rip off our country. Can't let it happen. As this enormous crowd shows, we have truth and justice on our side. We have a deep and enduring love for America in our hearts. We love our country. We have overwhelming pride in this great country and we have it deep in our souls. Together, we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people, by the people and for the people. Our brightest days are before us. Our greatest achievements, still away. I think one of our great achievements will be election security. Because nobody until I came along had any idea how corrupt our elections were. And again, most people would stand there at 9 o'clock in the evening and say I want to thank you very much, and they go off to some other life. But I said something's wrong here, something is really wrong, can have happened. And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun. My fellow Americans, for our movement, for our children, and for our beloved country. And I say this despite all that's happened. The best is yet to come. So we're going to, we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we're going to the Capitol, and we're going to try and give. The Democrats are hopeless — they never vote for anything. Not even one vote. But we're going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones because the strong ones don't need any of our help. We're going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country. So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I want to thank you all. God bless you and God Bless America. Thank you all for being here. This is incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you.\"\n",

            "  \"Text\": \"The people of France     The first lady of the United States and members of the United States Congress          Two distinguished guests, veterans, and my fellow Americans, we are gathered here on freedom's altar          On these shores, on these bluffs. On          This day seventy five years ago, ten thousand men shed their blood and thousands sacrificed their lives for their brothers, for their countries, and for the survival of liberty.          Today we remember those who fell, and we honor all who fought right here in Normandy.          They won back this ground for civilization. To more than one hundred and seventy veterans of the Second World War who join us today, you are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live. You are the pride of our nation. You are the glory of our republic, and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.          Here with you are over 60 veterans who landed on D-Day. Our debt to you is everlasting. Today we express our undying gratitude. When you were young, these men enlisted their lives in a great crusade.          One of the greatest of all times. Their mission is the story of an epic battle and a ferocious internal struggle between good and evil. On the 6th of June 1944, they joined a liberation force of awesome power and breathtaking scale.          After months of planning, the Allies had chosen this ancient coastline to mount their campaign to vanquish the wicked tyranny of the Nazi empire from the face of the earth.          The battle began in the skies above us. In those first tense midnight hours, 1000 aircraft roared overhead with seventeen thousand allied airborne troops preparing to leap into the darkness beyond these trees.          Then came Dawn. The enemy who had occupied these heights so the largest naval or modern in the history of the world.          Just a few miles offshore were 7000 vessels bearing 130 thirty thousand warriors.          They were the citizens of free and independent nations united by their duty to their compatriots and to millions yet unborn. There were the British whose nobility and fortitude saw them through the worst of Dunkirk and the London Blitz. The full violence of Nazi fury was no match for the full grandeur of British pride.          Thank you.          There were the Canadians whose robust sense of honor and loyalty compelled them to take up arms alongside Britain from the very, very beginning.          There were the fighting poles, the tough Norwegians, and the intrepid Aussies. There were the gallant French commandos soon to be met by thousands of their brave cut who had been ready to write a new chapter in the long history of French valor.          And finally, there were the Americans. They came from the farms of a vast heartland. The streets of glowing cities in the forges of mighty industrial towns. Before the war, many had never ventured beyond their own community. Now they had come to offer their lives half a world from home.          This speech codenamed Omaha          was defended by the Nazis with monstrous firepower, thousands and thousands of mines and spikes driven into the sand so deeply.          It was here that tens of thousands of the Americans came. The guys who boarded the landing craft that morning knew that they carried on their shoulders not just the pack of a soldier. But the fate of the world. Colonel George Taylor, whose Sixteenth Infantry Regiment would join in the first wave, was asked what would happen if the Germans stopped          right then and there cold and the beach just stopped. What would happen? This great American replied, 'Why, the 18th Infantry is coming in right behind us, the twenty-sixth infantry will come on to. Then there is the second infantry division already afloat and the Ninth Division and the 2nd Armored and the 3rd Armored and all the rest.          Maybe the 16th won't make it, but someone will. One of those men in Taylor's sixteenth regiment was Army medic Ray Lambert. Ray was only twenty-three, but he had already earned three Purple Hearts and two Silver Stars fighting in North Africa and Sicily where he and his brother Bill, no longer with us, served side by side.          In the early morning hours, the two brothers stood together on the deck of the USS Rico before boarding two separate Higgins landing craft. 'If I don't make it,' Bill said, 'please, please take care of my family.' Ray asked his brother to do the same.          Of the 31 men on Ray's landing craft, only Ray and six others made it to the beach.          There were only a few of them left. Fish came to the sector right here below us. Easy red it was called. Again and again, Ray ran back into the water. He dragged out one man after another. He          He was shot through the arm. His leg was ripped open by shrapnel. His back was broken.          He nearly drowned. He had been on the beach for hours, bleeding and saving lives. When he finally lost consciousness, he woke up the next day on a cot          beside another badly wounded soldier. He looked over and saw his brother Bill. They made it. They made it. They made it.          At 98 years old,          Ray is here with us today with his fourth Purple Heart and his third Silver Star from Omaha. Ray,          The free world salutes you.          Nearly two hours in unrelenting fire from these bluffs kept the Americans pinned down on the sand. Now read with our heroes' blood. Then just a few hundred yards from where I'm standing, a breakthrough came. The battle turned.          And with it, history. Down on the beach, Captain Joe Dawson, the son of a Texas preacher, led company through a minefield to a natural fold in the hillside still here just beyond this path to my right.          Captain Dustin snuck beneath an enemy machine gun perch and tossed his grenades. Soon American troops were charging up Dyson's ras. What a job he did.          What bravery he showed.          Lieutenant Spalding and the men from company he moved on to crush the enemy strong point on the far side of this cemetery and stop the slaughter on the beach below. Countless more Americans poured out across this ground all over the countryside.          They joined fellow American warriors from Utah Beach and allies from Juneau, Sword, and Gold along with the airborne and the French patriots.          Private 1st Class Russell Pickett of the twenty-ninth division's famed 168 infantry regiment had been wounded in the first wave that landed on Omaha Beach. At a hospital in England, Private Pickett vowed to return to battle. 'I am going to return', he said.          'I am going to return.'          Six days after D-Day, he rejoined his company. Two-thirds had been killed already. Many          Many had been wounded.          Within 15 minutes of the invasion, they lost 19 just from the small town of Bedford, Virginia, alone.          Before long, a grenade left Private Pickett          and he was gravely wounded. So badly wounded, again he chose to return.          He didn't care. He had to be here. He was then wounded a third time and laid unconscious for 12 days. They thought he was gone.          They thought he had no chance.          Russell Pickett is the last known survivor of the legendary company A, and today, believe it or not, he has returned once more to the shores to be with his comrades. Private Pickett, you honor us all with your presence.          Tough guy.          By the fourth week of August, Paris was liberated.          Landed here, pushed all the way to the center of Germany, some threw open the gates of the Nazi concentration camps to liberate Jews who had suffered the bottomless horrors of the Holocaust, and some warriors fell on other fields of battle, returning to rest on this soil for eternity.          Before this place was consecrated to history, the land was owned by a French farmer, a member of the French resistance. These were great people. These were strong and tough people. His terrified wife waited out D-Day in a nearby house, holding tight to their little baby girl. The next day, a soldier appeared.          'I'm an American,' he said. 'I'm here to help.' The French woman was overcome with emotion and cried. Days later, she laid flowers on fresh American graves.          Today, her granddaughter Stephanie serves as a guide at this cemetery.          This week, Stephanie led 92-year-old Marian Wynn of California to see the grave of her brother Don for the very first          Marian and Stephanie are both with us today.          And we thank you for keeping alive the memories of our precious heroes.          Nine thousand three hundred and eighty-eight young Americans rest in the white crosses and Stars of David arrayed on these beautiful grounds. Each one has been adopted by a French family that thinks of him as their own. They come from all over France to look after our boys. They kneel.          They cry. They pray. They place flowers, and they never forget.          Today America embraces the French people and thanks you for honoring our beloved.          To all of our friends and partners, our cherished alliance was forged in the heat of battle          tested in the trials of war and proven in the blessings of peace.          Our bond is unbreakable.          From across the earth, Americans are drawn to this place as though it were a part of our very souls.          We come not only because of what they did here; we come because of who they were. They were young men with their entire lives before them. They were husbands who said goodbye to the young brides and their duty as their fate. They were fathers who would never meet their infinite sons and daughters because they had a job to do, and with God as their witness, they were going to get it done.          More powerful than the strength of American arms was the strength of American hearts.          These men ran through the fires of hell, moved by a force no weapon could destroy.          The fierce patriotism of a free, proud, and sovereign people.          Not for control and domination but for liberty, democracy, and self-rule. They pressed on for love and home and country.          The main streets, the schoolyards, the churches, and neighbors, the families and communities that gave us men such as these.          They were sustained by the confidence that America can do anything because we are a noble nation with a virtuous people, praying to a righteous God.          The exception of my came from          a truly exceptional spirit. The abundance of courage came from an abundance of faith.          The great deeds of an army came from the great depths of their love as they confronted their faith. The Americans of the hour placed themselves into the palm of God's hand.          The men behind me will tell you that they are just the lucky ones. As one of them recently put it, 'All the heroes are buried here.          But we know what these men did. We knew how brave they were. They came here and saved freedom. And then they went home and showed us all what freedom is all about.          The American sons and daughters who saw us to victory were no less extraordinary in peace.          They build families.          They build industries.          They build a national culture that inspired the entire world. In the decades that followed          America defeated communism. Civil rights revolutionized science, launched a man to the moon, and then kept on pushing new frontiers. And today America is stronger than ever before.          Seven decades ago,          The war is D-day for a sinister enemy who spoke of a thousand-year empire in defeating that evil.          Left a legacy that will last not only for a thousand years but for all time.          For as long as the soul knows of duty and honor.          For as long as freedom keeps its hold on the human heart, to the man who sits behind me and the boys who rest in the field before me. Your examples will never ever grow old.          Your legend will never die. Your spirit, brave, unyielding, and true, will never die. The blood that they spilled          The tears that they shed          The lives that they gave, the sacrifice they made did not just win a battle. It did not win a war. Those who fought here won a future for our nation. They won the survival of our civilization. And they showed us the way to love, cherish, and defend our way of life.          For many centuries to come.          Today, as we stand together upon this sacred          We pledged that our nation's          Will forever be strong and united          We will forever be together          Our people will forever be bold, our hearts will forever be loyal, and our children and their children will forever and always be free.          May God bless          Our great veterans. May God bless our allies. May God bless the heroes of D-Day          and may God bless.\"\n",

            "  \"Text\": \"Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, first lady of the United States.     And my fellow Americans, we meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans. Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation.          The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people. Many of us have campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers, to rebuild and revitalize our nation's infrastructure, to reduce the price of health care and prescription drugs, to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern, and secure, and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first.          There is a new opportunity in American politics if only we have the courage together to seize it.          Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.          This year America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission and the power of American pride.          In June, we marked 75 years since the start of what General Dwight Eisenhower called the Great Crusade, the Allied liberation of Europe in World War Two. D-Day, June 6, 1944, fifteen thousand young American men jumped from the sky, and sixty thousand more stormed in from the sea to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those incredible heroes: Private First Class Joseph Riley, Staff Sergeant Irving Lacker, and Sergeant Herman. Gentlemen, we salute you.          In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag, Buzz Aldrin.          Thank you. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets. In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, redefined the middle class. And when you get down to it, there is nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with America.          Now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure. We must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within reach. We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.          But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.          Together we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge all divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight I ask you to choose greatness.          Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades. In just over two years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom, a boom that has rarely been seen before. There has been nothing like it. We have created five point three million new jobs and importantly, 600,000 new manufacturing jobs, something which almost everyone said was impossible to do.          But the fact is we are just getting started.          Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue-collar workers who I promised to fight for. They're growing faster than anyone else thought possible. Nearly five million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.          The US economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Not even close.          Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century. African-American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with Disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in the history of our country, one hundred and fifty-seven million people at work.          We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. We virtually ended the estate tax, or death tax as it is often called, on small businesses, for ranches, and also for family farms.          We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty and gave critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures. We passed very importantly, right to try.          My administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations.          And we have unleashed a revolution in American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.          After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world. Our military is the most powerful on Earth by far, and America is again winning each and every day.          Members of Congress, the state of our union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.          On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone, almost double the number expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.          If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way.          We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate, in some cases years and years waiting. Not right.          The Senate has failed to act on these nominations which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our country. Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that that's possible.          In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA accountability so that we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.          And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. They said it couldn't be done.          Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time, non-violent drug offender. Over the next 22 years, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population and far beyond.          Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing and the need to remedy this total injustice. She served almost 22 years, and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of her life.          In June, I commuted Alice's sentence. When I saw Alice's beautiful family, I knew I did something right. Alice is with us tonight and she is a terrific woman. Terrific. Alice, please.          Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.          When I saw Alice's beautiful family, I knew I did something right.          As the United States continues to address the issues facing our criminal justice system, we urge Congress to pass the FIRST STEP Act. Thank you.          The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with preexisting conditions.          Already as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years. But we must do more. It's unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, this is unfair, and together we will stop it. And we'll stop it fast.          I am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients, finally.          We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down.          No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years, we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within ten years. We have made incredible strides. Incredible.          Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.          Tonight I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer. Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave ten-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was four, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude's Children's Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself.          That's what happened. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered. They loved her. They still love her. With tears in their eyes, as she hung up a poster that read 'last day of chemo.' Thank you very much, Grace.          You are a great inspiration to everyone in this room. Thank you very much.          Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next ten years to fund this critical life-saving research.          To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children.          I am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave, so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.          There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth. To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.          Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.          And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God.          The final part of my agenda is to protect American security. Over the last two years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military, with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. Finally.          For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours, members of NATO. But now we have secured, over the last couple of years, more than $100 billion of increase in defense spending from our NATO allies. They said it couldn't be done.          As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art missile defense system.          Under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests.          For example, decades ago, the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.          Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't. In which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.          As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home. Nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15 months. If I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.     Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong-un is a good one. Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.          Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela and its new president. We stayed with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom and condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.          Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence, not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free and we will stay tonight. We renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.          One of the most complex set of challenges we face and have for many years is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principle realism, not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of Israel and proudly opened the American embassy.          Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years in Afghanistan and Iraq. Nearly 7000 American heroes have given their lives, and more than 52000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than seven trillion dollars in fighting wars in the Middle East. As a candidate for president, I loudly pledged a new approach—great nations do not fight endless wars.          When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20000 square miles in Iraq and Syria just two years ago. Today, we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.          I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach, if possible, a political settlement in Afghanistan. The opposing side is also very happy to be negotiating. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor, and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this long and bloody conflict.          In Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troops' presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement, but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace, and the other side would like to do the same thing.          It is time.          Above all, friend and foe alike, never doubt this nation's power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, violent terrorists attacked the USS Cole, and last month, American forces killed one of the leaders of that attack.          We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wimberly, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wimberly, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. We vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.          My administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror, the radical regime in Iran. It is a radical regime; they do bad, bad things. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.          We put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by us on a country. We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants 'death to America' and threatens genocide against the Jewish people.          We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. Just months ago, eleven Jewish Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT officer Timothy Madsen raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer, and he was very successful.          Timothy just had his 12th surgery, and he's going in for many more, but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Madsen, please, thank you. We are forever grateful. Thank you very much.          Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. Not only did Judah narrowly escape death, but more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday.          They wouldn't do that for me, Judah. He says he could still remember the exact moment nearly 75 years ago when, after 10 months in a concentration camp, he and his family were put on a train and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly, the train screeched to a very strong halt.          A soldier appeared, and his family braced for the absolute worst. Then, his father cried out with joy, 'It's the Americans! It's the Americans!'          A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight. She was a prisoner. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. To Joshua, the American soldiers were proof that God exists. They came down from the sky. They came down from heaven. I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman.          But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of the American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight, seated side by side here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated. Thank you very much.          American soldiers beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day 1944. They were just young men of 18 and 19 hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old, but they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this nation and generations yet unborn. Why did they do it? They did it for America. They did it for us. Everything that has come since our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice—all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.          Think of this capital. Think of this very chamber where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and our highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires. Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent Republic who have come from the icy shores of Maine to the volcanic peaks of Hawaii, from the snowy woods of Wisconsin to the red deserts of Arizona, from the green farms of Kentucky to the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered?          I ask the men and women of this Congress to look at the opportunities before us. Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead, our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream. We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we squander our great inheritance or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans.          This is the time to reignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.          This is our future, our fate, and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls, and we must always keep faith in America's destiny—that One Nation Under God must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you.\"\n",

            "  \"Text\": \"If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer. It’s the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different; that their voice could be that difference. It’s the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled – Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of Red States and Blue States: we are, and always will be, the United States of America. It’s the answer that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day. It’s been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America. I just received a very gracious call from Senator McCain. He fought long and hard in this campaign, and he’s fought even longer and harder for the country he loves. He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine, and we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader. I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they have achieved, and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation’s promise in the months ahead. I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to Delaware, the Vice President-elect of the United States, Joe Biden. I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last sixteen years, the rock of our family and the love of my life, our nation’s next First Lady, Michelle Obama. Sasha and Malia, I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that’s coming with us to the White House. And while she’s no longer with us, I know my grandmother is watching, along with the family that made me who I am. I miss them tonight, and know that my debt to them is beyond measure. To my campaign manager David Plouffe, my chief strategist David Axelrod, and the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics – you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you’ve sacrificed to get it done. But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to – it belongs to you. I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn’t start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington – it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause. It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation’s apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth. This is your victory. I know you didn’t do this just to win an election and I know you didn’t do it for me. You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime – two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century. Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us. There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how they’ll make the mortgage, or pay their doctor’s bills, or save enough for college. There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created; new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair. The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America – I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you – we as a people will get there. There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won’t agree with every decision or policy I make as President, and we know that government can’t solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it’s been done in America for two-hundred and twenty-one years – block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand. What began twenty-one months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek – it is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It cannot happen without you. So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other. Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it’s that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers – in this country, we rise or fall as one nation; as one people. Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long. Let us remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House – a party founded on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity. Those are values we all share, and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress. As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, “We are not enemies, but friends…though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.” And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn – I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will be your President too. And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world – our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand. To those who would tear this world down – we will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security – we support you. And to all those who have wondered if America’s beacon still burns as bright – tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope. For that is the true genius of America – that America can change. Our union can be perfected. And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow. This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that’s on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She’s a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing – Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old. She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn’t vote for two reasons – because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin. And tonight, I think about all that she’s seen throughout her century in America – the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can’t, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can. At a time when women’s voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot. Yes we can. When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs and a new sense of common purpose. Yes we can. When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved. Yes we can. She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that “We Shall Overcome.” Yes we can. A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination. And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change. Yes we can. America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves – if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made? This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time – to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth – that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can’t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes We Can. Thank you, God bless you, and may God Bless the United States of America. \"\n",

            "  \"Text\": \"Good morning. Scripture tells us, 'Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you…write them on the tablet of your heart.' Secretary Carter, Chairman Dunford, outstanding members of our Armed Forces, and most of all, survivors of that September day and the families of those we lost -- it is a great honor, once again, to be with you on this day, a day that I know is still difficult, but which reveals the love and faithfulness in your hearts and in the heart of our nation.          We remember, and we will never forget, the nearly 3,000 beautiful lives taken from us so cruelly -- including 184 men, women and children here, the youngest just three years old. We honor the courage of those who put themselves in harm’s way to save people they never knew. We come together in prayer and in gratitude for the strength that has fortified us across these 15 years. And we renew the love and the faith that binds us together as one American family.                     Fifteen years may seem like a long time, but for the families who lost a piece of their heart that day, I imagine it can seem like just yesterday. Perhaps it’s the memory of a last kiss given to a spouse, or the last goodbye to a mother or father, a sister or a brother. We wonder how their lives might have unfolded, how their dreams might have taken shape. And I am mindful that no words we offer, or deeds we do, can ever truly erase the pain of their absence.          And yet, you -- the survivors and families of 9/11 -- your 'steadfast love and faithfulness' has been an inspiration to me and to our entire country. Even as you’ve mourned, you’ve summoned the strength to carry on. In the names of those you’ve lost, you’ve started scholarships and volunteered in your communities, and done your best to be a good neighbor and a good friend and a good citizen. And in your grief and grace, you have reminded us that, together, there’s nothing we Americans cannot overcome.          The question before us, as always, is: How do we preserve the legacy of those we lost? How do we live up to their example? And how do we keep their spirit alive in our own hearts?          Well, we have seen the answer in a generation of Americans -- our men and women in uniform, diplomats, intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement professionals -- all who have stepped forward to serve and who have risked and given their lives to help keep us safe. Thanks to their extraordinary service, we’ve dealt devastating blows to al Qaeda.          We've delivered justice to Osama bin Laden. We’ve strengthened our homeland security. We've prevented attacks. We've saved lives. We resolve to continue doing everything in our power to protect this country that we love. And today, we once again pay tribute to these patriots, both military and civilian, who serve in our name, including those far away from home in Afghanistan and Iraq.          Perhaps most of all, we stay true to the spirit of this day by defending not only our country, but also our ideals. Fifteen years into this fight, the threat has evolved. With our stronger defenses, terrorists often attempt attacks on a smaller, but still deadly, scale.                     Hateful ideologies urge people in their own country to commit unspeakable violence. We’ve mourned the loss of innocents from Boston to San Bernardino to Orlando.          Groups like al Qaeda, like ISIL, know that we will never be able -- they will never be able to defeat a nation as great and as strong as America. So, instead, they've tried to terrorize in the hopes that they can stoke enough fear that we turn on each other and that we change who we are or how we live. And that's why it is so important today that we reaffirm our character as a nation -- a people drawn from every corner of the world, every color, every religion, every background -- bound by a creed as old as our founding, e pluribus unum. Out of many, we are one. For we know that our diversity -- our patchwork heritage -- is not a weakness; it is still, and always will be, one of our greatest strengths. This is the America that was attacked that September morning. This is the America that we must remain true to.          Across our country today, Americans are coming together in service and remembrance. We run our fingers over the names in memorial benches here at the Pentagon. We walk the hallowed grounds of a Pennsylvania field. We look up at a gleaming tower that pierces the New York City skyline. But in the end, the most enduring memorial to those we lost is ensuring the America that we continue to be -- that we stay true to ourselves, that we stay true to what's best in us, that we do not let others divide us.          As I mark this solemn day with you for the last time as President, I think of Americans whose stories I’ve been humbled to know these past eight years -- Americans who, I believe, embody the true spirit of 9/11.          It’s the courage of Welles Crowther, just 24 years old, in the South tower -- the man in the red bandana who spent his final moments helping strangers to safety before the towers fell. It’s the resilience of the firehouse on Eighth Avenue -- patriots who lost more than a dozen men, but who still suit up every day as the 'Pride of Midtown.' It’s the love of a daughter -- Payton Wall of New Jersey -- whose father, in his last moments on the phone from the towers, told her, 'I will always be watching over you.' It’s the resolve of those Navy SEALS who made sure justice was finally done, who served as we must live as a nation -- getting each other’s backs, looking out for each other, united, one mission, one team. It’s the ultimate sacrifice of men and women who rest for eternity not far from here, in gentle green hills in perfect formation -- Americans who gave their lives in faraway places so that we can be here today, strong and free and proud. It’s all of us -- every American who gets up each day, and lives our lives, carries on. Because as Americans, we do not give in to fear. We will preserve our freedoms and the way of life that makes us a beacon to the world. 'Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you…write them on the tablet of your heart.' And how we conduct ourselves as individuals and as a nation, we have the opportunity each and every day to live up to the sacrifice of those heroes that we lost. May God bless the memory of the loved ones here and across the country. They remain in our hearts today. May He watch over these faithful families and all who protect us. And may God forever bless the United States of America.\"\n",

            "  \"Date\": \"September 20, 2016\",\n",
            "  \"Text\": \"Mr. President; Mr. Secretary General; fellow delegates; ladies and gentlemen: As I address this hall as President for the final time, let me recount the progress that we’ve made these last eight years. From the depths of the greatest financial crisis of our time, we coordinated our response to avoid further catastrophe and return the global economy to growth. We’ve taken away terrorist safe havens, strengthened the nonproliferation regime, resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomacy. We opened relations with Cuba, helped Colombia end Latin America’s longest warm, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of Myanmar to this Assembly. Our assistance is helping people feed themselves, care for the sick, power communities across Africa, and promote models of development rather than dependence. And we have made international institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund more representative, while establishing a framework to protect our planet from the ravages of climate change. This is important work. It has made a real difference in the lives of our people. And it could not have happened had we not worked together. And yet, around the globe we are seeing the same forces of global integration that have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines in the existing international order. We see it in the headlines every day. Around the world, refugees flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict. Financial disruptions continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities. Across vast swaths of the Middle East, basic security, basic order has broken down. We see too many governments muzzling journalists, and quashing dissent, and censoring the flow of information. Terrorist networks use social media to prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims. Powerful nations contest the constraints placed on them by international law. This is the paradox that defines our world today. A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty, and unease, and strife. Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface. And so I believe that at this moment we all face a choice. We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration. Or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward, and not backward. I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century. I make this argument not based on theory or ideology, but on facts -- facts that all too often, we forget in the immediacy of current events.  Here’s the most important fact: The integration of our global economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children. Over the last 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut from nearly 40 percent of humanity to under 10 percent. That's unprecedented. And it's not an abstraction. It means children have enough to eat; mothers don’t die in childbirth. Meanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to cure diseases that have plagued us for centuries. The Internet can deliver the entirety of human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand-held device. In medicine and in manufacturing, in education and communications, we’re experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry. And as a result, a person born today is more likely to be healthy, to live longer, and to have access to opportunity than at any time in human history. Moreover, the collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders. Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears in retreat, the fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly doubled in the last 25 years. In remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for the dignity of all people no matter their gender, or race, or religion, or disability, or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are subject to public reproach. An explosion of social media has given ordinary people more ways to express themselves, and has raised people’s expectations for those of us in power. Indeed, our international order has been so successful that we take it as a given that great powers no longer fight world wars; that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear Armageddon; that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful union; that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth. I say all this not to whitewash the challenges we face, or to suggest complacency. Rather, I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have delivered this progress. In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction. As too often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored inequality within and among nations; have ignored the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities; have left international institutions ill-equipped, underfunded, under-resourced, in order to handle transnational challenges. And as these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest: religious fundamentalism; the politics of ethnicity, or tribe, or sect; aggressive nationalism; a crude populism -- sometimes from the far left, but more often from the far right -- which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination. We cannot dismiss these visions. They are powerful. They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens. I do not believe those visions can deliver security or prosperity over the long term, but I do believe that these visions fail to recognize, at a very basic level, our common humanity. Moreover, I believe that the acceleration of travel and technology and telecommunications -- together with a global economy that depends on a global supply chain - - makes it self-defeating ultimately for those who seek to reverse this progress. Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself. So the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared, and that the disruptions -- economic, political, and cultural -- that are caused by integration are squarely addressed. This is not the place for a detailed policy blueprint, but let me offer in broad strokes those areas where I believe we must do better together. It starts with making the global economy work better for all people and not just for those at the top. While open markets, capitalism have raised standards of living around the globe, globalization combined with rapid progress and technology has also weakened the position of workers and their ability to secure a decent wage. In advanced economies like my own, unions have been undermined, and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared. Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political power to further undermine the position of workers. In developing countries, labor organizations have often been suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by corruption and underinvestment. Mercantilist policies pursued by governments with export-driven models threaten to undermine the consensus that underpins global trade. And meanwhile, global capital is too often unaccountable -- nearly 8 trillion dollars stashed away in tax havens, a shadow banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight. A world in which one percent of humanity controls as much wealth as the other 99 percent will never be stable. I understand that the gaps between rich and poor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast between their own lives and others. Expectations rise, then, faster than governments can deliver, and a pervasive sense of injustice undermine people’s faith in the system. So how do we fix this imbalance? We cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box. Nor can we look to failed models of the past. If we start resorting to trade wars, market distorting subsidies, beggar thy neighbor policies, an overreliance on natural resources instead of innovation -- these approaches will make us poorer, collectively, and they are more like to lead to conflict. And the stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that central, planned control of the economy is a dead end. But I do believe there’s another path -- one that fuels growth and innovation, and offers the clearest route to individual opportunity and national success. It does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism that benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that economies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor, and growth is broadly based. And that means respecting the rights of workers so they can organize into independent unions and earn a living wage. It means investing in our people -- their skills, their education, their capacity to take an idea and turn it into a business. It means strengthening the safety net that protects our people from hardship and allows them to take more risks -- to look for a new job, or start a new venture. These are the policies that I’ve pursued here in the United States, and with clear results. American businesses have created now 15 million new jobs. After the recession, the top one percent of Americans were capturing more than 90 percent of income growth. But today, that's down to about half. Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in nearly 50 years. And with further investment in infrastructure and early childhood education and basic research, I’m confident that such progress will continue. So just as I’ve pursued these measures here at home, so has the United States worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism -- not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it. That’s why we’ve worked with other nations to create higher and clearer standards for banking and taxation -- because a society that asks less of oligarchs than ordinary citizens will rot from within. That’s why we’ve pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption, and tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they're fueled by hard work, and not the capacity to extort a bribe. That’s why we’ve worked to reach trade agreements that raise labor standards and raise environmental standards, as we've done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, so that the benefits are more broadly shared. And just as we benefit by combating inequality within our countries, I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between rich and poor nations around the globe. This is difficult politically. It's difficult to spend on foreign assistance. But I do not believe this is charity. For the small fraction of what we spent at war in Iraq we could support institutions so that fragile states don’t collapse in the first place, and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our goods. It's not just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do. And that’s why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat climate change. If we don't act boldly, the bill that could come due will be mass migrations, and cities submerged and nations displaced, and food supplies decimated, and conflicts born of despair. The Paris Agreement gives us a framework to act, but only if we scale up our ambition. And there must be a sense of urgency about bringing the agreement into force, and helping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of energy. So, for the wealthiest countries, a Green Climate Fund should only be the beginning. We need to invest in research and provide market incentives to develop new technologies, and then make these technologies accessible and affordable for poorer countries. And only then can we continue lifting all people up from poverty without condemning our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair. So we need new models for the global marketplace, models that are inclusive and sustainable. And in the same way, we need models of governance that are inclusive and accountable to ordinary people. I recognize not every country in this hall is going to follow the same model of governance. I do not think that America can -- or should -- impose our system of government on other countries. But there appears to be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now. And I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest. I believe in a liberal political order -- an order built not just through elections and representative government, but also through respect for human rights and civil society, and independent judiciaries and the rule of law. I know that some countries, which now recognize the power of free markets, still reject the model of free societies. And perhaps those of us who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end of the Cold War, because we've learned that liberal democracy will not just wash across the globe in a single wave. It turns out building accountable institutions is hard work -- the work of generations. The gains are often fragile. Sometimes we take one step forward and then two steps back. In countries held together by borders drawn by colonial powers, with ethnic enclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can sometimes appear to be a zero-sum game. And so, given the difficulty in forging true democracy in the face of these pressures, it’s no surprise that some argue the future favors the strongman, a top-down model, rather than strong, democratic institutions. But I believe this thinking is wrong. I believe the road of true democracy remains the better path. I believe that in the 21st century, economies can only grow to a certain point until they need to open up -- because entrepreneurs need to access information in order to invent; young people need a global education in order to thrive; independent media needs to check the abuses of power. Without this evolution, ultimately expectations of people will not be met; suppression and stagnation will set in. And history shows that strongmen are then left with two paths -- permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war. Now, I will admit, my belief that governments serve the individual, and not the other way around, is shaped by America’s story. Our nation began with a promise of freedom that applied only to the few. But because of our democratic Constitution, because of our Bill of Rights, because of our ideals, ordinary people were able to organize, and march, and protest, and ultimately, those ideals won out -- opened doors for women and minorities and workers in ways that made our economy more productive and turned our diversity into a strength; that gave innovators the chance to transform every area of human endeavor; that made it possible for someone like me to be elected President of the United States. So, yes, my views are shaped by the specific experiences of America, but I do not think this story is unique to America. Look at the transformation that's taken place in countries as different as Japan and Chile, Indonesia, Botswana. The countries that have succeeded are ones in which people feel they have a stake. In Europe, the progress of those countries in the former Soviet bloc that embraced democracy stand in clear contrast to those that did not. After all, the people of Ukraine did not take to the streets because of some plot imposed from abroad. They took to the streets because their leadership was for sale and they had no recourse. They demanded change because they saw life get better for people in the Baltics and in Poland, societies that were more liberal, and democratic, and open than their own. So those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully, because both the facts and history, I believe, are on our side. That doesn’t mean democracies are without flaws. It does mean that the cure for what ails our democracies is greater engagement by our citizens -- not less. Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics; too much entrenched partisanship; too little participation by citizens, in part because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote. In Europe, a well-intentioned Brussels often became too isolated from the normal push and pull of national politics. Too often, in capitals, decision-makers have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down. And so these are real problems, and as leaders of democratic governments make the case for democracy abroad, we better strive harder to set a better example at home. Moreover, every country will organize its government informed by centuries of history, and the circumstances of geography, and the deeply held beliefs of its people. So I recognize a traditional society may value unity and cohesion more than a diverse country like my own, which was founded upon what, at the time, was a radical idea -- the idea of the liberty of individual human beings endowed with certain God-given rights. But that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia, or Africa, or the Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary rule that denies them a voice in the decisions that can shape their lives. I believe that spirit is universal. And if any of you doubt the universality of that desire, listen to the voices of young people everywhere who call out for freedom, and dignity, and the opportunity to control their own lives. This leads me to the third thing we need to do: We must reject any forms of fundamentalism, or racism, or a belief in ethnic superiority that makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity. Instead we need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect of all human beings. It’s a truism that global integration has led to a collision of cultures; trade, migration, the Internet, all these things can challenge and unsettle our most cherished identities. We see liberal societies express opposition when women choose to cover themselves. We see protests responding to Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the Prophet Muhammad. In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force. Asian powers debate competing claims of history. And in Europe and the United States, you see people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics, and suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the character of our countries. Now, there’s no easy answer for resolving all these social forces, and we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions -- from their religion, from their ethnicity, from their sense of nationhood. But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group. If our religion leads us to persecute those of another faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race or tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray. The world is too small, we are too packed together, for us to be able to resort to those old ways of thinking. We see this mindset in too many parts of the Middle East. There, so much of the collapse in order has been fueled because leaders sought legitimacy not because of policies or programs but by resorting to persecuting political opposition, or demonizing other religious sects, by narrowing the public space to the mosque, where in too many places perversions of a great faith were tolerated. These forces built up for years, and are now at work helping to fuel both Syria’s tragic civil war and the mindless, medieval menace of ISIL. The mindset of sectarianism, and extremism, and bloodletting, and retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed. And if we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to co-exist for long. But I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these conflicts, and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy. And there is a military component to that. It means being united and relentless in destroying networks like ISIL, which show no respect for human life. But it also means that in a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won, we’re going to have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, and deliver aid to those in need, and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect. Across the region’s conflicts, we have to insist that all parties recognize a common humanity and that nations end proxy wars that fuel disorder. Because until basic questions are answered about how communities co-exist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human beings will suffer -- most of all in that region -- but extremism will continue to be exported overseas. And the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own societies. And what is true in the Middle East is true for all of us. Surely, religious traditions can be honored and upheld while teaching young people science and math, rather than intolerance. Surely, we can sustain our unique traditions while giving women their full and rightful role in the politics and economics of a nation. Surely, we can rally our nations to solidarity while recognizing equal treatment for all communities -- whether it’s a religious minority in Myanmar, or an ethnic minority in Burundi, or a racial minority right here in the United States. And surely, Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel, but Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land. We all have to do better as leaders in tamping down, rather than encouraging, a notion of identity that leads us to diminish others. And this leads me to the fourth and final thing we need to do, and that is sustain our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the rights and responsibilities of nations. As President of the United States, I know that for most of human history, power has not been unipolar. The end of the Cold War may have led too many to forget this truth. I’ve noticed as President that at times, both America’s adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington -- and perhaps too many in Washington believed that as well. But I believe America has been a rare superpower in human history insofar as it has been willing to think beyond narrow selfinterest; that while we’ve made our share of mistakes over these last 25 years -- and I’ve acknowledged some -- we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our actions with our ideals. And as a consequence, I believe we have been a force for good. We have secured allies. We’ve acted to protect the vulnerable. We supported human rights and welcomed scrutiny of our own actions. We’ve bound our power to international laws and institutions. When we've made mistakes, we've tried to acknowledge them. We have worked to roll back poverty and hunger and disease beyond our borders, not just within our borders. I'm proud of that. But I also know that we can't do this alone. And I believe that if we're to meet the challenges of this century, we are all going to have to do more to build up international capacity. We cannot escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them. When Iran agrees to accept constraints on its nuclear program that enhances global security and enhances Iran's ability to work with other nations. On the other hand, when North Korea tests a bomb that endangers all of us. And any country that breaks this basic bargain must face consequences. And those nations with these weapons, like the United States, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path of reducing our stockpiles, and reaffirming basic norms like the commitment to never test them again. We can't combat a disease like Zika that recognizes no borders -- mosquitoes don't respect walls -- unless we make permanent the same urgency that we brought to bear against Ebola - - by strengthening our own systems of public health, by investing in cures and rolling back the root causes of disease, and helping poorer countries develop a public health infrastructure. We can only eliminate extreme poverty if the sustainable development goals that we have set are more than words on paper. Human ingenuity now gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children -- including our girls -- the education that is the foundation for opportunity in our world. But we have to put our money where our mouths are. And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding -- to replace the ravages of war with cooperation -- if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes I'm criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action -- not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term -- enhances our security. And I think that's not just true for us. If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home, it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time, but over time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure. In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of disputes offered by law will mean far greater stability than the militarization of a few rocks and reefs. We are all stakeholders in this international system, and it calls upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to which we belong. And the good news is, is that many nations have shown what kind of progress is possible when we make those commitments. Consider what we’ve accomplished here over the past few years. Together, we mobilized some 50,000 additional troops for U.N. peacekeeping, making them nimble, better equipped, better prepared to deal with emergencies. Together, we established an Open Government Partnership so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around the globe. And together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home. We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering. I'll be discussing that more this afternoon. But we have to follow through, even when the politics are hard. Because in the eyes of innocent men and women and children who, through no fault of their own, have had to flee everything that they know, everything that they love, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves. We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children, if the unspeakable happened to us. And we should all understand that, ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees. There are a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing. But many nations -- particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography -- that can do more to offer a hand, even if they also insist that refugees who come to our countries have to do more to adapt to the customs and conventions of the communities that are now providing them a home. Let me conclude by saying that I recognize history tells a different story than the one that I've talked about here today. There's a much darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt. Human beings are too often motivated by greed and by power. Big countries for most of history have pushed smaller ones around. Tribes and ethnic groups and nation states have very often found it most convenient to define themselves by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together. Time and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment only to repeat, then, cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that's our fate. We have to remember that the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war. But we also have to remember that the choices of individual human beings created a United Nations, so that a war like that would never happen again. Each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best. For we have shown that we can choose a better history. Sitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote that, Human progress never rolls [in] on the wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be coworkers with God.'1  And during the course of these eight years, as I've traveled to many of your nations, I have seen that spirit in our young people, who are more educated and more tolerant, and more inclusive and more diverse, and more creative than our generation; who are more empathetic and compassionate towards their fellow human beings than previous generations.  And, yes, some of that comes with the idealism of youth. But it also comes with young people’s access to information about other peoples and places -- an understanding unique in human history that their future is bound with the fates of other human beings on the other side of the world. I think of the thousands of health care workers from around the world who volunteered to fight Ebola. I remember the young entrepreneurs I met who are now starting new businesses in Cuba, the parliamentarians who used to be just a few years ago political prisoners in Myanmar. I think of the girls who have braved taunts or violence just to go to school in Afghanistan, and the university students who started programs online to reject the extremism of organizations like ISIL. I draw strength from the young Americans -- entrepreneurs, activists, soldiers, new citizens -- who are remaking our nation once again, who are unconstrained by old habits and old conventions, and unencumbered by what is, but are instead ready to seize what ought to be. My own family is a made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and cultures and faiths from a lot of different parts of the world -- just as America has been built by immigrants from every shore. And in my own life, in this country, and as President, I have learned that our identities do not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by lifting somebody else up. They don’t have to be defined in opposition to others, but rather by a belief in liberty and equality and justice and fairness. And the embrace of these principles as universal doesn't weaken my particular pride, my particular love for America -- it strengthens it. My belief that these ideals apply everywhere doesn’t lessen my commitment to help those who look like me, or pray as I do, or pledge allegiance to my flag. But my faith in those principles does force me to expand my moral imagination and to recognize that I can best serve my own people, I can best look after my own daughters, by making sure that my actions seek what is right for all people and all children, and your daughters and your sons. This is what I believe: that all of us can be co-workers with God. And our leadership, and our governments, and this United Nations should reflect this irreducible truth. Thank you very much.\"\n",

            "  \"Text\": \"Let us imagine, for a moment, that we are gathered together late in the evening on December 9th, 1948. World War II is over, but peace is far from secure. Soviet troops blockade West Berlin. In Czechoslovakia, a coup has toppled the last democracy in Eastern Europe. In South Africa, apartheid is becoming the law of the land. Economies around the world remain in ruins. Forty million displaced persons are trapped in refugee camps. And in Paris, negotiators from 58 disparate and rivalrous nations struggle to agree on a version of peace to replace the horrors of war. Already debate has raged. Through 300 meetings and over 3000 hours. Yet still in question is whether the new United Nations can do what the old League of Nations could not – offer the world a roadmap for peace and prosperity strong enough to withstand the appeals of demagogues and the ravages of poverty and fear. The outcome rested on the persuasive powers, the diplomatic skill, the dogged persistence of one woman. An American woman, in her 60s, with only four years of formal education, but schooled in the real world. Eleanor Roosevelt had seen humanity at its finest, and its cruelest. Dead boys on the fields in France. Soup kitchens and empty store fronts in the Great Depression. Hospital corridors filled with wounded soldiers in Pacific war zones. Refugee camps filled with Holocaust survivors and those displaced by war. 'Dear Lord,' she often prayed, 'help me to remember someone died for me today… help me to remember to ask and answer am I worth dying for'. For nearly two years, she had pushed and prodded a fractured world to rally around Universal Declaration of Human Rights… around the radical idea that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity, that human rights are not granted by governments – they are the birthright of every woman, man, and child. It was an idea so powerful that it could change the course of history. But getting agreement on a single text was fiendishly difficult. The delegates drafted, revised, rewrote, and argued. It was so grueling that at one point, a representative from Panama reminded his colleagues that diplomats had human rights, too. Now, with midnight approaching and December 9th drawing to a close, it was time for a final vote. Eleanor knew she had the support to win, but she worried that any dissent would wreck the fragile consensus she had negotiated. Early in the morning of December 10th, forty-eight nations representing the vast majority of the world's people voted in favor of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Soviets abstained, but not a single country dissented. A silence overtook the chamber. Then all the members of the UN rose as one to honor the moment and applaud the woman who had made it happen. Eleanor believed it was a landmark comparable to the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the American Bill of Rights – a new Magna Carta for all people. Not perfect, but a 'compass' pointing the world toward freedom and dignity. She also understood that this victory was only the beginning of what she called 'the long trek' to make human rights a human reality. History has proved her right. If Eleanor were here today, I think she would be appalled, but not surprised, to see dictators still oppressing their people, from Moscow to Beijing and beyond. You'd see authoritarians growing in influence… corruption and economic injustice still deeply entrenched, and in too many places, getting worse… you'd see racism and xenophobia still turning us against one another. But I think she would also be proud of what we've accomplished. The Universal Declaration has become the single most widely translated single document in the history of the world. Generations of activists, leaders, and ordinary citizens have carried its principles forward. They have fought and organized and campaigned to tear down barriers that prevented people from enjoying the full measure of freedom, the full experience of dignity, and the full benefits of citizenship. They've built a system of international law and institutions to protect the freedoms spelled out in the Declaration, and to hold violators accountable. They've woven human rights into domestic constitutions and made them a crucial test of any government's legitimacy. In country after country, human rights have come to be seen not as a high-minded luxury but as a core national interest. In many places, racist laws have been repealed, legal and social practices that relegated women to second-class status have been abolished, the ability of religious minorities to practice faith freely has been secured. Command economies have fallen and free markets have risen. Extreme poverty has receded and war has become less frequent. The language and law of human rights have enabled people to reclaim ownership of their own lives. Millions whose lives were once narrowed by injustice or oppression are now able to live more freely and participate more fully in the political, economic, and social lives of their communities. So yes, today the world is safer, richer, freer, and fairer than it was in 1948. Yet 70 years after that historic night in Paris, forces are at work from both the left and right to undo the progress in the name of nationalism, populism, religion, and ideology. Our long trek remains far from finished. I come here today not just to remember Eleanor, but to remind us that we have urgent work ahead. I want to thank Kate O'Regan and the Bonavero Institute for giving me this opportunity. I am grateful to Helena Kennedy, Helen Mountfield, all our distinguished panelists, Mansfield College, and Oxford University. The cause of human rights has been close to my heart for a long time. Looking back now, I can see how lessons from my family and faith about treating others as equals — and expecting as a girl to be respected – along with the activism of the 1960s and the work I did as a young lawyer, put me on this path. I learned that human rights are not just the stuff of philosophy or high diplomacy but must be the substance of everyday life. As Eleanor famously said, they begin in the small places close to home. That's what I saw when I went door-to-door gathering evidence about the barriers preventing children with disabilities from getting an education. I learned it in Alabama when I went undercover to expose continuing racial segregation in schools and in South Carolina, where I investigated the plight of teenagers jailed in adult prisons as though they were hardened felons. I saw it in the faces of abused and neglected children in my work at Yale-New Haven Hospital, which led to my first article on the legal rights of children. But I couldn't have imagined in 1974 the long and winding path that would bring me here today. But I knew that I wanted to devote my life to widening the circle of justice and opportunity. There were still too many of our fellow men and women whose human suffering we failed to see, to hear, and to feel… too many excluded from the fundamental rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration. That's what led me to provide legal services to poor families in Arkansas and then across America, and to fight for universal health care as First Lady. It led me to Beijing in 1995, to declare that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights. And to Geneva sixteen years later, to say that human rights are also gay rights and gay rights are human rights. It's why, as Secretary of State, I made it a priority of American foreign policy to stand up for survivors of mass rape and human trafficking, for persecuted religious and ethnic minorities, and for imprisoned journalists and dissidents – like the blind, barefoot human rights lawyer who took refuge in our embassy in China. It's why I ran for President of the United States and fought for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America – an America I still believe in, and always will. So that's what brings me here today. We have arrived at a moment of peril like none we've seen since the end of the Cold War. Today, the human rights that Eleanor Roosevelt fought for – and the democracies devoted to their protection – are under siege from within and without and in need of both defense and renewal. To turn back a rising tide of authoritarianism, we must hold fast to the principles of the Universal Declaration and offer a compelling new vision of democracy that delivers a better life for people everywhere – with less inequality and more opportunity, unity, and decency. As Eleanor said, 'to stand still is to retreat.' Now is the time for leaders to stand up, bravely and firmly, for the values we share and the future we need. And for citizens to support and join them. What we need is an authentic, grassroots revival of the democratic spirit and the struggle for justice. We're starting to see it emerge, driven by popular movements around the world – from Black Lives Matter activists demanding racial justice to women courageously declaring 'Me Too' …to tens of thousands protesting attacks on an independent judiciary in Poland…to people demonstrating against corruption and impunity in Guatemala and Nicaragua. It's time for all of us, in whatever way we can, to heed the courage of activists like Malala… [who is here with us today]… She didn't ask to become a global symbol of the struggle for the human rights of girls seeking an education. She wanted to live her life and go to school. But after the Taliban shot her in the head, there was no way she was going to back down. It's time for us to heed the courage of Nadia Murad, who endured slavery and rape at the hands of ISIS but refused to hide her face in shame and instead forced the world to confront the atrocities committed against the Yazidis and the horror of sexual violence as a weapon of war. Last week she won the Nobel Peace Prize, but what she deserves even more is to see her message turned into action everywhere that women's human rights are threatened. Now is the time to bring human rights out of the ivory tower and diplomatic conferences and into those small places close to home…into neighborhoods and schools, offices, factories, and farms…into the hearts and daily interactions of men and women everywhere who will never read the lofty language of the Universal Declaration and yet embody its aspirations and must share in its promise. As Eleanor also said, our ideals 'carry no weight unless the people know them, unless the people understand them, unless the people demand that they be lived.' To succeed, we've got to be clear-eyed about the many challenges we face. Recent history has delivered bitter disappointments. The exuberance of the Arab Spring gave way to civil war in Syria, chaos in Libya, and a return to dictatorship in Egypt. In Myanmar, high hopes for democratic progress have foundered as the military wages a campaign of atrocities against the Rohingya and imprisons journalists – like the Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo – who have done the business of reporting the truth. There was a time not that long ago when many of us believed that the appeal of democracy, combined with diplomatic engagement and expanding trade, would slowly but inexorably lead closed societies to open up and embrace human rights. But in China, Xi Jinping has consolidated more power than any leader since Mao. And in Russia, where Vladimir Putin has tightened his grip, journalists and dissidents like the Ukrainian filmmaker and political prisoner Oleg Sentsov are jailed, beaten, or murdered with impunity. Even in what we once thought of as sturdy democracies, freedom is under threat – and when freedom is threatened human rights, obviously, are vulnerable. By Freedom House's count, more than 70 nations curtailed civil liberties and political rights in 2017, the twelfth year in a row in which freedom contracted around the world. It's a reminder of how fragile an experiment self-government really is. When viewed against the sweep of human history, how fleeting. There may be no such thing as a 'sturdy' or 'consolidated' democracy. It is always at risk and always in need of defense. We see it in Turkey and the Philippines, where strongmen are conducting ruthless campaigns of repression. We see it here in Europe. Last month, the European Parliament initiated an Article 7 disciplinary process against Hungary's right-wing nationalist government for failing to respect human rights and the rule of law. The independence of the judiciary, civil society, and academia – including Central European University – are all under attack. A similar story is unfolding in Poland. If you haven't read Anne Applebaum's haunting recent essay in the Atlantic Magazine, I hope you will. And as we are all too well aware, the crisis extends to my own country, the world's oldest democracy. I don't use the word crisis lightly. True, there are no tanks in the streets of Washington or New York. But our democratic institutions and traditions are under threat on many fronts. The President is degrading the rule of law, delegitimizing our elections, spreading corruption, undermining our national unity that makes democracy possible, and discrediting truth, facts, and reason. From day one, the Trump administration has shown hostility to civil rights that previous generations fought to secure and defend – from the Muslim travel ban to the barring of transgender Americans from serving in the military to the unspeakable cruelty inflicted on undocumented families arriving at our southern border, including separating children, some as young as eight months, from their parents. As in so many other societies, the United States is facing a toxic backlash to years of social and economic change, playing to our ugliest impulses, not our better angels. Our divisions make us targets for foreign manipulation, which seeks to sow chaos and pit us against each other. And even as we face the resurgence of the old challenges of nationalism, tribalism, and authoritarianism, new threats are already upon us, especially at the intersection of technology and autocracy. Technology and globalization were supposed to bind the world closer together, break down the barriers rulers use to hold their people back, and spur more openness, innovation, and freedom. Now, to a large degree, that did happen. And yet, we've learned the hard way that technology is a double-edged sword, not just carrying democratic values to oppressed people but also giving authoritarians the tools to tighten control and counterattack at the foundations of open societies. The whole world now knows that Putin's Russia is waging cyberwarfare and manipulating social media to influence elections and referenda and to polarize and cripple democracies across the west. It's not just the United States ,but in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the Baltic countries and beyond, Kremlin-backed hackers and propogandists have sought to inflame divisions and advance an extreme right-wing agenda. Here in the UK, senior lawmakers like Damian Collins, a Tory, and Labour's Tom Watson, have called for a full and independent investigation into Russia's role in the Brexit referendum. Collins, who has led the Parliamentary inquiry, warns of 'a crisis' in British democracy (and I quote) 'based on the systematic manipulation of data to support the relentless targeting of citizens' (unquote). And while Moscow coopts the open internet for its own purposes, Beijing is working tenaciously to end it altogether. Chinese authorities are stepping up their already prodigious censorship and control of the web through what is known as 'The Great Firewall of China,' intimidating, imprisoning, or exiling anyone who dares challenge their restrictions. But Beijing is not content to merely repress its own people, but also bullies foreign tech companies, nations, and international organizations alike to accept its vision of an internet divvied up between all-controlling national governments. At home, Beijing is using artificial intelligence to construct a fearsome new 21st century model of totalitarian repression. In the western Xinjiang Province, Chinese authorities have deployed a vast surveillance system of checkpoints and high-tech cameras that use facialrecognition to track the Uighur population. This feeds into what UN officials have described as a 'massive internment camp shrouded in secrecy' that holds between 100,000 to one million Uighurs. And there are credible reports of mass detention, torture, and brainwashing. This is just the beginning. China is exporting the tools they're testing to other countries, from Malaysia to Zimbabwe. The government also is collecting enormous amounts of data on all its citizens and designing a nation-wide Social Credit Score system to track their daily lives, reward behavior the state approves, and punish those who step out of line. It's like an episode of Black Mirror – in fact, I believe it was an episode of Black Mirror. Think of all this as a beta test… an experiment in constructing a terrifying new high-tech gulag, where Big Brother is everywhere and privacy and dignity are obsolete. Putin, for one, understands the power of what China is pioneering. He has predicted that whoever dominates artificial intelligence will, and I quote 'become the ruler of the world.' When you add it all up – democracies in turmoil, autocrats ascendant, a dystopian future taking shape before our eyes – it sounds daunting. And it is. All of us who care about the legacy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should be very worried. But let us view this challenge not as an omen of defeat, but as a call to action. As Eleanor said, 'courage is more exhilarating than fear, and in the long run, it is easier.' Think of what she faced in 1948: A rapidly changing world with powerful new technologies. Authoritarian menaces in Moscow and elsewhere on the rise, trying to undermine democracies. America and Europe deeply divided. Actually… this all sounds pretty familiar, doesn't it? And as my friend Michelle Bachelet, the former two-time president of Chile, said last month in her first speech as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 'This is a time of many setbacks for human rights, but, she went on, it is also one of great opportunity.' So there is a way forward. And let me suggest some priorities for the work ahead. Above all, democracies have got to stick together. We need to have each other's backs. For example, when Saudi Arabia tried to punish Canada for speaking out on behalf of human rights, in particular, the women who had campaigned for the right to drive and then were rounded up and imprisoned in the kingdom, the silence from Ottawa's supposed allies was shameful. Every democracy in the world should be standing with the Canadians. Benjamin Franklin told his fellow patriots after they signed the Declaration of Independence that we must all hang together, or most assuredly, we shall all hang separately. This is not the forum to lay out a full coordinated strategy for confronting Russia and China, and other human rights backsliders and abusers, but Putin and Xi and other authoritarians do understand strength -- and that's what we must demonstrate. And on China in particular, let me say: as the West considers the future of this enormously complex and important relationship, as we debate how and when to compete and cooperate, human rights must be front and center. And let's not be fooled by the masquerade that countries like Hungary and Turkey are still real democracies, just illiberal ones. 'Illiberal democracy' is a contradiction in terms. To be a democracy takes more than an election – even a free and fair one. It also requires free expression and a free press, the rule of law and an independent judiciary, vibrant civil society and transparent and responsive institutions that are accountable to all citizens and protect their rights equally. Without these things, illiberal democracy is no democracy at all – it's just authoritarianism by another name. I hope the European Union – and the people of Europe – will resist the backsliding we're seeing in the east. It's disheartening to watch conservatives in Brussels vote to shield Viktor Orban from censure – including British Tories. They've come a long way from the party of Churchill and Thatcher. The slide toward autocracy is at least as grave a threat to the European project as the financial crisis or Brexit. It's also a threat to NATO. The treaty that created the alliance made it very clear: NATO is, quote, 'founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law,' unquote. If those values fail, so will the alliance. And we also can't be taken in by self-styled realists or the admirers of strongmen who argue that human rights are luxuries that must be sacrificed in pursuit of stability and security. Clamping down on freedom can create the illusion of security. So can building walls and turning away refugees. But over the long term, repression undermines stability and creates new threats. Autocracy is brittle. The illusion of stability fades, but people's yearning for freedom does not. So democracies sticking together is the first thing we must do. Here's a second: Now more than ever, let us be unwavering, unambiguous, and unequivocal in defending the achievements of the human rights movement and championing our values. There have long been critics who dismiss this movement as western imperialism or who would have us practice a form of moral relativism. There are others who claim to cherish human rights, but their concern only extends as far as their own tribe. These are attacks on the concept of universality that lies at the heart of the Declaration. Now, it's obviously true different cultures have different conceptions of liberty and the relationship between the individual and the state. It's also true that people will think differently about those close to them – their kin and country – than they do about people far away who they've never met and who may look, love, and worship very differently than they do. But the drafters of the Declaration understood all this. They came from different cultures and faiths and disagreed about many things. But they recognized a fundamental truth of human nature – one at least as powerful and hard-wired as the fears that pit us against each other and make us crave security and stability. The truth that people everywhere yearn for freedom and dignity, regardless of race or creed. Even if we don't always recognize or honor it in each other, that yearning is there. We have that much in common, at least. That's why they changed the document's name, late in the process, from the International Declaration of Human Rights to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a declaration on behalf of every person on the planet. It's also worth noting that in the decades after the Declaration, the human rights movement wasn't spurred primarily by imperialist western powers or overbearing NGOs, it was carried forward by freedom fighters battling colonialism and activists standing up to repression. I wonder what they would think of critics who confidently declare that human rights are incompatible with certain cultures or faiths and that democracy will never take root in some regions of the world. Tell that to the dissidents who've risked their lives from Tiananmen to Tahrir. You don't stand in front of a tank because of a foreign idea imposed on you from afar. You do it because the drive for freedom is so powerful that it's worth dying for. That's what has fueled every movement for human rights, every campaign for democracy, every struggle against oppression all over the world. The freedom to live up to one's own God-given potential. The potential within every person to join freely with others to shape their communities and their societies, the potential to share life's beauties and tragedies, laughter and tears with the people we love – that potential is universal. Another criticism comes from those who say that economic rights have been neglected or sacrificed in pursuit of civil and political rights. I share the concern about the staggering levels of economic inequality in many countries, including the United States. I do not believe that capitalism is fundamentally incompatible with democracy, but unregulated, predatory capitalism is. Massive inequality, corruption, and unrestrained corporate monopoly power are fundamentally anti-democratic. But here, too, we are presented with a false choice. Political and economic rights must go hand-in-hand. As Dr. Martin Luther King once observed: 'What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn't have enough money to buy a hamburger?' And the reverse is also true. I'll never forget what one Egyptian man said on his way to vote for the first time after the fall of Mubarak. 'Freedom is a blessing… It's more important than food and water…When you eat in humiliation, you can't taste the food.' We must understand – as Eleanor Roosevelt did – that dignity requires both. It was there in FDR's famous Four Freedoms. The freedom from want stood with the freedom of expression and worship, and the freedom from fear. That's why, in addition to political rights, the Declaration proclaims the right to work in a job of your choice, with fair conditions and fair pay – enough to provide a life of dignity for your family – as well as the right to form or join a union. It recognizes the right to education…and to security in old age, or in the event of unemployment or disability. As the 1993 Vienna Declaration put it, human rights are 'indivisible, interdependent and interrelated.' It's self-defeating to pit some rights against others. But it's true that we have much work to do to make the Declaration's economic and social rights a reality in all people's lives. So all of us in the human rights movement should say loudly and clearly: Yes, economic rights are human rights, and human rights are economic rights. A living wage and access to health care, education, housing, and clean air and water – these are not privileges, they're fundamental rights. And we should hold governments accountable for them, just as we do when it comes to protecting political and civil rights. Because if economic rights are human rights, economic policy is human rights policy. And abuse of economic policy – policy that perpetuates injustice and inequality – is a human rights abuse. And that leads to a third priority – which I also consider an urgent imperative: Democracies must deliver on the promise of a better life for their people. The mounting pressures our societies face from migration, automation, corruption, and fragmentation demand what Franklin Roosevelt called 'bold persistent experimentation.' Champions of democracy can't let ourselves be pigeonholed as defenders of a discredited status quo. Instead, we have to offer a compelling future, especially for young people who came of age in the shadow of the global financial crisis. I still believe what I said every day in my presidential campaign: we have to make our economies and our democracies work for everyone, not just those at the top. We need to break the stranglehold on economic and political power held by a small group of powerful interests and billionaire families, reduce inequality, and produce both more economic growth and more economic fairness. And there are bold, creative proposals worth exploring, like putting a price on carbon pollution and using the money to fund clean energy and to send dividends back to working families. That would lower emissions and raise incomes at the same time – not to mention weaken petro-dictators like Putin. Or taxing net worth instead of annual income, which would reduce inequality and provide the resources needed to make major new investments in infrastructure and education. We should explore how to make a universal basic income work in a way that preserves dignity and a sense of purpose. And we need to reform corporate governance and break up monopolies and oligopolies. Now the list goes on. Because making our democracies deliver also requires making government more ethical, transparent, and responsive. In the United States, that means getting dark money out of our politics and doing more to get the voices of marginalized groups into our politics – including by securing voting rights and the actual process of voting: protecting the integrity of our elections. And on both sides of the Atlantic, we have to address the challenge of migration with courage and compassion. In the United States, I continue to advocate for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in the country – and an end to the administration's cruel abuses at the border. Here in Europe, I add my voice to those warning of the risks of giving up on Schengen and the great benefits that freedom of movement have delivered. Look, I know very personally how hard this issue is, how deep the emotions run. I'm not talking about open borders, I'm talking about immigration laws enforced with fairness and respect for human rights. Of course, security and the rule of law must be upheld. Of course, nations have a right and duty to control their borders, in concert with their neighbors. But we can't let fear or bias force us to give up the values that have made our democracies both great and good. Our goal should be to build societies that are secure and welcoming, where everyone counts and everyone contributes – people who are newcomers to our lands and people who have lived in the same place for generations. Now, obviously I realize that the priorities I've outlined here will be more difficult to achieve because the current American administration seems to value the flattery of dictators more than the solidarity of democracies. And Europe's woes compound our challenge. Without the leadership from governments that we've counted on in the past, the role of civil society, academia, the press, and the business community in advancing human rights is more important than ever. There's a simple metaphor that helps explain what it takes to support thriving, free societies. It's like a three-legged stool: One leg is a responsive and accountable democratic government, the second is a fair and growing economy, and the third is a vibrant civil society. If any leg of the stool goes wobbly, that's trouble, and the others have to be twice as strong. Today that means powerful corporations like Google and Facebook are going to have to decide whether to stand on the side of human rights and democracy or give in to the allure of untapped markets and cave to pressure from authoritarians in places like Beijing and Moscow. Given the scale of the repression that is occurring China, I hope that Google will listen to the pleas of its own employees and refuse to be complicit, regardless of how many advertising dollars are at stake. It is better to be on the right side of history. And let's be clear: digital rights are now human rights. The Universal Declaration was decades ahead of its time when it confirmed that all people everywhere have the right 'to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.' That's why, eight years ago, as Secretary of State, I called on the world to recognize and respect every person's right to connect to a free and open internet. Today, there are new fights to join. Data is the now world's most valuable commodity. And I want you to think about it as a commodity. It is the fuel for artificial intelligence and the lifeblood of the global economy. So it is past time to demand that all nations and corporations respect the right of individuals to control their own data. This goes beyond what we normally think of as privacy rights – it's about preserving and promoting individual autonomy in the digital age. There is important work being done right now by technologists like Tim BernersLee, the inventor of the world wide web, and Ro Khanna, the U.S. Congressman representing Silicon Valley. They're trying to develop guidelines for how this could work. Human rights advocates from all over the world should be part of this discussion. None of this will be easy. We have given away our data, we have given away our privacy all too easily and willingly. And now, we've got to take it back. But the fight for human rights never is easy and the risks are real. Denis Mukwege, the Congolese doctor who also received the Nobel Peace Prize last week for treating thousands of survivors of rape, survived himself an assassination attempt. And after recovering, he kept on working. Today, the we are waiting anxiously for news about the fate of Jamal Khashoggi a Saudi journalist who dared to raise his voice in dissent. If reports of his murder, perhaps inside the Saudi Consulate, are true, it is both a grave crime and a reminder of the sacrifices made every day in the name of human rights. So it is imperative we continue to support the men and women on the front lines of this struggle, and not to lose heart while we are doing so. Authoritarians may be riding high right now. But in the long run the desire for freedom, respect, and dignity cannot be denied – even when the opposition seems strongest and the tools at hand weakest. This is why I love the story of the Helsinki Accords. When they were signed in 1975, many in the West dismissed the ambitious human rights provisions as not worth the paper they were printed on. The Soviets would obviously disregard them. All it would do is hand the Kremlin a public relations victory for having signed it. Indeed, Brezhnev believed he had scored such a coup that he ordered the full text of the Helsinki Accords printed in Pravda. But then something unexpected happened. Behind the Iron Curtain, activists and dissidents felt empowered to begin agitating and working for change. The Accords gave them cover for the first time to talk openly about human rights, and it gave them a focal point around which to organize and build networks. Soviet officials were caught in a bind: They couldn't condemn a document the Kremlin had signed, but if they enforced its provisions the entire authoritarian system would break down. But in the years that followed, the shipyard workers of Solidarity in Poland, reformers in Hungary, demonstrators in Czechoslovakia all seized on the fundamental rights ratified at Helsinki. They at least rhetorically held their governments to account for not living up to the standards to which they had agreed. And as Communism crumbled, it became clear the Soviets had made a mistake: They underestimated the people living under the yoke of oppression and the universal yearning for freedom. Again, Eleanor Roosevelt said, 'never belittle the value of words, for they have a way of getting translated into facts.' That is really what this is all about. To continue translating the words of human rights into facts on the ground, into the reality of people's everyday lives… into those small places, close to home…'so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any map of the world.' That's where 'every man, woman and child seeks equal justice, equal opportunity,equal dignity without discrimination… Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere… Without concerted citizen action to uphold them close to home, we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world.' Remember, in the small places, close to home: That's where rights become real and where they must be defended. Not just by governments, but by all of us. It is in those small places where we will reap the rewards of freedom, dignity, and equality…face-to-face with our neighbors, classmates, and colleagues. With our fellow citizens. So as we face the enormously complex challenges of mass migration, artificial intelligence, cyberwarfare, what we need most is actually quite simple – we have to rediscover our common humanity. Not an abstract warm feeling for the entire species. But the ability to see ourselves in others, not just when it's easy but when it's hard. That is the root of the Golden Rule that I was taught as a girl in Sunday school and that in one form or another appears in every great faith: 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.' Because they are you, and you are they. It starts with listening to each other…and hearing each other…beyond the echo chambers and polarized news feeds…putting ourselves, the best we can, in each other's shoes – especially if our views seem miles apart, trying to find common ground on which we can stand. That's how we nurture what Michael Ignatieff calls the ordinary virtues: trust and tolerance, forgiveness, reconciliation, and resilience. If people's eyes glaze over when you talk about human rights, talk about trust and tolerance, and forgiveness, and reconciliation, and resilience. Try to practice radical empathy. It is a time, as it says in the Old Testament Chapter of Isaiah, for all of us to become repairers of the breach. To hold on to the courage of our convictions. To be willing to go forward ourselves and support others who do. Eleanor Roosevelt risked her reputation, her physical safety – we know of at least seventeen assassination threats – her livelihood to champion the Declaration. And on her deathbed, she continued to call out a message to generations to come: 'Staying aloof is not a solution; it is a cowardly evasion.'  We cannot afford to be aloof. We cannot afford to be cowardly. As the drafters of the Universal Declaration stood together 70 years ago, so must we stand together to produce its benefits. So let us continue the long trek that they began… toward a future where democracy flourishes, autocracy fails, and every man, woman, and child has the freedom to pursue their own God-given potential. Thank you all very much.\"\n",

            "  \"Text\": \"My fellow citizens: I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition. Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents. So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans. That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet. These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land - a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights. Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America - they will be met. On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord. On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics. We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness. In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted - for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things - some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom. For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life. For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth. For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn. Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction. This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America. For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act - not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. And all this we will do. Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions - who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage. What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them - that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works - whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account - to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day - because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government. Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control - and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart - not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good. As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and we are ready to lead once more. Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint. We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort - even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we’ll work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you. For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus - and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace. To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West - know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist. To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it. As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment - a moment that will define a generation - it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all. For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate. Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends - honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism - these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility - a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task. This is the price and the promise of citizenship. This is the source of our confidence - the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny. This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed - why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath. So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people: 'Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it].' America. In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations. Thank you. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. \"\n",

            "  \"Text\": \"The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987. I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school. My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month. My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip. Instead of a motorcade, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten years old. When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road. I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi. When we went upcountry, we traveled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap. But it was a magical trip. To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty. I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left. And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him. I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called 'boy' by his employers for most of his life. I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the 'Pipeline' camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles. I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult. I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya. In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation. And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments. His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years. And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well. In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole. The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds. But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict. One statistic powerfully describes this unfulfilled promise. In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea. Today, South Korea's economy is forty times larger than Kenya's. How can we explain this fact? Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families. We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country. And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches. So what explains this? I believe there a number of factors at work. Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances. It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife. Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation. This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development. Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade. When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system. And, as Frederick Douglass once stated: 'Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did, and it never will.' As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies. This lack of access for Africa's agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth. Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors. As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa. And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity. A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent. But, Kenya must do its part. It cannot wait for other nations to act first. The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind. It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind. Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable. One that serves its people and is free from corruption. There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring. Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability. You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability. And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy. It is being threatened by corruption. Corruption is not a new problem. It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem. It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society. My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections. In just the last year, our own U.S. Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain. But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve. I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty. And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this. It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health. It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground. In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else. And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort. Corruption has a way of magnifying the very worst twists of fate. It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIV/AIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought. What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions. It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice. Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive. Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism. Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust. In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost. And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time. The good news is that there are already signs of progress here. Willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in Kenya. The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue. Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of 2002. This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising. But elections are not enough. In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people. Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country. The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels. And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made. I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start. We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job. And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe. So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials. Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs. And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests. Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption. In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not. Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place. Finally, ethnic-based tribal politics has to stop. It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good. It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society. Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing. Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor. An accountable, transparent government can break this cycle. When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups. Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see. The Kenyan people are the ultimate guardians against abuses. The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya. But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid. As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction. And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be. By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future. By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives. They fight the fight of our time. Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too. You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way. You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth. And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together. This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today. I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see. As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young. Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country. I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime. As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments. We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future. In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve. I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can. Thank you. \"\n",

            "  \"Text\": \"I am honored to be here tonight. A proud mother. A proud Democrat. A proud American. And a proud supporter of Barack Obama. My friends, it is time to take back the country we love. Whether you voted for me, or voted for Barack, the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose. We are on the same team, and none of us can sit on the sidelines. This is a fight for the future. And it's a fight we must win. I haven't spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children, campaigning for universal health care, helping parents balance work and family, and fighting for women's rights at home and around the world . . . to see another Republican in the White House squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people. And you haven't worked so hard over the last 18 months, or endured the last eight years, to suffer through more failed leadership. No way. No how. No McCain. Barack Obama is my candidate. And he must be our President. Tonight we need to remember what a Presidential election is really about. When the polls have closed, and the ads are finally off the air, it comes down to you — the American people, your lives, and your children's futures. For me, it's been a privilege to meet you in your homes, your workplaces, and your communities. Your stories reminded me everyday that America's greatness is bound up in the lives of the American people — your hard work, your devotion to duty, your love for your children, and your determination to keep going, often in the face of enormous obstacles. You taught me so much, you made me laugh, and . . . you even made me cry. You allowed me to become part of your lives. And you became part of mine. I will always remember the single mom who had adopted two kids with autism, didn't have health insurance and discovered she had cancer. But she greeted me with her bald head painted with my name on it and asked me to fight for health care. I will always remember the young man in a Marine Corps t-shirt who waited months for medical care and said to me: 'Take care of my buddies; a lot of them are still over there....and then will you please help take care of me?' I will always remember the boy who told me his mom worked for the minimum wage and that her employer had cut her hours. He said he just didn't know what his family was going to do. I will always be grateful to everyone from all fifty states, Puerto Rico and the territories, who joined our campaign on behalf of all those people left out and left behind by the Bush Administrtation. To my supporters, my champions — my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits – from the bottom of my heart: Thank you. You never gave in. You never gave up. And together we made history. Along the way, America lost two great Democratic champions who would have been here with us tonight. One of our finest young leaders, Arkansas Democratic Party Chair, Bill Gwatney, who believed with all his heart that America and the South could be and should be Democratic from top to bottom. And Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a dear friend to many of us, a loving mother and courageous leader who never gave up her quest to make America fairer and smarter, stronger and better. Steadfast in her beliefs, a fighter of uncommon grace, she was an inspiration to me and to us all. Our heart goes out to Stephanie's son, Mervyn, Jr, and Bill's wife, Rebecca, who traveled to Denver to join us at our convention. Bill and Stephanie knew that after eight years of George Bush, people are hurting at home, and our standing has eroded around the world. We have a lot of work ahead. Jobs lost, houses gone, falling wages, rising prices. The Supreme Court in a right-wing headlock and our government in partisan gridlock. The biggest deficit in our nation's history. Money borrowed from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis. Putin and Georgia, Iraq and Iran. I ran for President to renew the promise of America. To rebuild the middle class and sustain the American Dream, to provide the opportunity to work hard and have that work rewarded, to save for college, a home and retirement, to afford the gas and groceries and still have a little left over each month. To promote a clean energy economy that will create millions of green collar jobs. To create a health care system that is universal, high quality, and affordable so that parents no longer have to choose between care for themselves or their children or be stuck in dead end jobs simply to keep their insurance. To create a world class education system and make college affordable again. To fight for an America defined by deep and meaningful equality - from civil rights to labor rights, from women's rights to gay rights, from ending discrimination to promoting unionization to providing help for the most important job there is: caring for our families. To help every child live up to his or her God-given potential. To make America once again a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. To bring fiscal sanity back to Washington and make our government an instrument of the public good, not of private plunder. To restore America's standing in the world, to end the war in Iraq, bring our troops home and honor their service by caring for our veterans. And to join with our allies to confront our shared challenges, from poverty and genocide to terrorism and global warming. Most of all, I ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years. Those are the reasons I ran for President. Those are the reasons I support Barack Obama. And those are the reasons you should too. I want you to ask yourselves: Were you in this campaign just for me? Or were you in it for that young Marine and others like him? Were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids? Were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage? Were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible? We need leaders once again who can tap into that special blend of American confidence and optimism that has enabled generations before us to meet our toughest challenges. Leaders who can help us show ourselves and the world that with our ingenuity, creativity, and innovative spirit, there are no limits to what is possible in America. This won't be easy. Progress never is. But it will be impossible if we don't fight to put a Democrat in the White House. We need to elect Barack Obama because we need a President who understands that America can't compete in a global economy by padding the pockets of energy speculators, while ignoring the workers whose jobs have been shipped overseas. We need a President who understands that we can't solve the problems of global warming by giving windfall profits to the oil companies while ignoring opportunities to invest in new technologies that will build a green economy. We need a President who understands that the genius of America has always depended on the strength and vitality of the middle class. Barack Obama began his career fighting for workers displaced by the global economy. He built his campaign on a fundamental belief that change in this country must start from the ground up, not the top down. He knows government must be about 'We the people' not 'We the favored few.' And when Barack Obama is in the White House, he'll revitalize our economy, defend the working people of America, and meet the global challenges of our time. Democrats know how to do this. As I recall, President Clinton and the Democrats did it before. And President Obama and the Democrats will do it again. He'll transform our energy agenda by creating millions of green jobs and building a new, clean energy future. He'll make sure that middle class families get the tax relief they deserve. And I can't wait to watch Barack Obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single American. Barack Obama will end the war in Iraq responsibly and bring our troops home – a first step to repairing our alliances around the world. And he will have with him a terrific partner in Michelle Obama. Anyone who saw Michelle's speech last night knows she will be a great First Lady for America. Americans are also fortunate that Joe Biden will be at Barack Obama's side. He is a strong leader and a good man. He understands both the economic stresses here at home and the strategic challenges abroad. He is pragmatic, tough, and wise. And, of course, Joe will be supported by his wonderful wife, Jill. They will be a great team for our country. Now, John McCain is my colleague and my friend. He has served our country with honor and courage. But we don't need four more years . . . of the last eight years. More economic stagnation ...and less affordable health care. More high gas prices ...and less alternative energy. More jobs getting shipped overseas ...and fewer jobs created here. More skyrocketing debt ...home foreclosures ...and mounting bills that are crushing our middle class families. More war . . . less diplomacy. More of a government where the privileged come first ...and everyone else comes last. John McCain says the economy is fundamentally sound. John McCain doesn't think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis. John McCain wants to privatize Social Security. And in 2008, he still thinks it's okay when women don't earn equal pay for equal work. With an agenda like that, it makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities. Because these days they're awfully hard to tell apart. America is still around after 232 years because we have risen to the challenge of every new time, changing to be faithful to our values of equal opportunity for all and the common good. And I know what that can mean for every man, woman, and child in America. I'm a United States Senator because in 1848 a group of courageous women and a few brave men gathered in Seneca Falls, New York, many traveling for days and nights, to participate in the first convention on women's rights in our history. And so dawned a struggle for the right to vote that would last 72 years, handed down by mother to daughter to granddaughter – and a few sons and grandsons along the way. These women and men looked into their daughters' eyes, imagined a fairer and freer world, and found the strength to fight. To rally and picket. To endure ridicule and harassment. To brave violence and jail. And after so many decades – 88 years ago on this very day – the 19th amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote would be forever enshrined in our Constitution. My mother was born before women could vote. But in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for President. This is the story of America. Of women and men who defy the odds and never give up. How do we give this country back to them? By following the example of a brave New Yorker , a woman who risked her life to shepherd slaves along the Underground Railroad. And on that path to freedom, Harriett Tubman had one piece of advice. If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see the torches in the woods, keep going. If they're shouting after you, keep going. Don't ever stop. Keep going. If you want a taste of freedom, keep going. Even in the darkest of moments, ordinary Americans have found the faith to keep going. I've seen it in you. I've seen it in our teachers and firefighters, nurses and police officers, small business owners and union workers, the men and women of our military – you always keep going. We are Americans. We're not big on quitting. But remember, before we can keep going, we have to get going by electing Barack Obama president. We don't have a moment to lose or a vote to spare. Nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance. I want you to think about your children and grandchildren come election day. And think about the choices your parents and grandparents made that had such a big impact on your life and on the life of our nation. We've got to ensure that the choice we make in this election honors the sacrifices of all who came before us, and will fill the lives of our children with possibility and hope. That is our duty, to build that bright future, and to teach our children that in America there is no chasm too deep, no barrier too great – and no ceiling too high – for all who work hard, never back down, always keep going, have faith in God, in our country, and in each other. Thank you so much. God bless America and Godspeed to you all.\"\n",

            "  \"Text\": \" Good evening. After the last election, I said, “We owe Donald Trump an open mind and the chance to lead.” I really meant it. Every president deserves that. And Trump walked into the Oval Office with so much set up for him: A strong economy. Plans for managing crises—like a pandemic. Yes, we Democrats would have disagreed with him on many, many things. But if he had put his own interests and ego aside—if he could have seen the humanity in a child ripped from her parents at the border or a protester calling for justice or a family whose home was destroyed by a wildfire who happened to live in a blue state—if he had even tried to govern well and lead us all—he might have proved us wrong. And that would have been a good thing, for America and the world. I wish Donald Trump had been a better president. Because America needs a better president than this. America needs a president who shows the same compassion, determination, and leadership in the White House that we see in our communities. Throughout this crisis, Americans have kept going—checking on neighbors, showing up to jobs at grocery stores and nursing homes. Because it still takes a village. We need leaders equal to this moment. We need Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Everyone has a story about Joe’s thoughtfulness and empathy. I remember him calling after my mother, Dorothy, died. We talked about being raised by strong, no-nonsense women. When I walked with him through the house where he grew up in Scranton, he remembered every detail—about the house, the neighborhood, the people who lived there, and the values they shared. There is no better testament to Joe’s character than his family—including his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, who has said she will keep her teaching job as First Lady. That’s outstanding. And boy, did Joe, pick the right partner in Kamala Harris—another daughter of an extraordinary mother. Kamala is relentless in the pursuit of justice, and uncommonly kind. When her press secretary Tyrone Gayle, a remarkable young man who had also worked on my campaign, was dying of cancer, she dropped everything to be with him in his final moments. Because that’s who she is. I know a thing or two about the slings and arrows coming her way. Kamala can handle them all. This is the team to pull our nation back from the brink and build back better. But they can’t do it without all of us. For four years, people have said to me, “I didn’t realize how dangerous he was.” “I wish I could go back and do it over.” “I should have voted.” This can’t be another woulda-coulda-shoulda election. If you’re voting by mail, request your ballot now, and send it back as soon as you can. If you vote in person, do it early. Bring a friend and wear a mask. Become a poll worker. Most of all, no matter what, vote. And convince everyone you know to vote. Remember in 2016 when Trump asked: “What do you have to lose?” Well, now we know: our health, our jobs, even our lives. Our leadership in the world and, yes, our post office. As Michelle Obama and Bernie Sanders warned us on Monday: If Trump is re-elected, it will get even worse. My friends, we need unity now more than ever. But let’s set our sights higher than getting one man out of the White House. Let’s vote for the jobs Joe will create, and for emergency relief that lifts small businesses and hardworking people. Because it’s wrong that the wealthiest Americans got $400 billion richer during the pandemic while 40 million people lost their jobs. Vote for parents struggling to balance their child’s education and their safety. And for health care workers fighting COVID-19 with no help from the White House. Vote for paid family leave and health care for everyone. Vote to protect Social Security, Medicare, reproductive rights, and our planet. Vote for DREAMers and their families. For law enforcement that serves and respects communities of color. Vote for justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, because Black Lives Matter. Vote to make sure we—not a foreign adversary—choose our president. Vote for the America we saw in the roll call last night: diverse, compassionate, full of energy and hope. Vote like our lives and livelihoods are on the line, because they are. Remember: Joe and Kamala can win 3 million more votes and still lose. Take. It. From. Me. We need numbers so overwhelming Trump can’t sneak or steal his way to victory. So text VOTE to 30330 and let’s go win. One hundred years ago yesterday, the 19th Amendment was ratified. It took seven decades of suffragists marching, picketing, and going to jail to push us closer to that more perfect union. Fifty-five years ago, John Lewis marched and bled in Selma because that work was unfinished. Tonight I am thinking of the girls and boys who see themselves in America’s future because of Kamala Harris—a Black woman, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, and our nominee for Vice President of the United States. This is our country’s story: breaking down barriers and expanding the circle of possibility. So to all the young people: Don’t give up on America. Despite our flaws and problems, we have come so far. And we can still be a more just and equal country, full of opportunities previous generations could never have imagined. There’s a lot of heartbreak in America right now—and the truth is, many things were broken before the pandemic. But, as the saying goes, the world breaks everyone at one point or another, and afterward, many are stronger in the broken places. Joe Biden knows how to heal, because he’s done it himself. So come November, we will be strong together. We will heal together. We will redeem the soul and promise of this country together. We will elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris—together. \"\n",

            "  \"Text\": \"Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Very rowdy group. Thank you, my friends. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so very much for being here and I love you all, too. Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans. This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for and I’m sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country. But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together, this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life. I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too, and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful and it will be for a long time, but I want you to remember this. Our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love and about building an America that’s hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted. We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don’t just respect that – we cherish it. It also enshrines other things; the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them. Now – and let me add, our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years but all the time. So let’s do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear: making our economy work for everyone not just those at the top, protecting our country and protecting our planet and breaking down all the barriers that hold any American back from achieving their dreams. We’ve spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American dream is big enough for everyone – for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities. For everyone.So now our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek. And I know you will. I am so grateful to stand with all of you. I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey. It has been a joy getting to know them better, and it gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the frontlines of our democracy representing Virginia in the Senate. To Barack and Michelle Obama, our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude. We thank you for your graceful, determined leadership that has meant so much to so many Americans and people across the world. And to Bill and Chelsea, Mark, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express. You crisscrossed this country on our behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most – even four-month-old Aidan, who traveled with his mom. I will always be grateful to the creative, talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country. Hillary Clinton walks off the stage after making her concession speech on Wednesday. You poured your hearts into this campaign. For some of you who are veterans, it was a campaign after you had done other campaigns. Some of you, it was your first campaign. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anybody could have ever expected or wanted. And to the millions of volunteers, community leaders, activists and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook, even in secret, private Facebook sites ... I want everybody coming out from behind that and make sure your voices are heard going forward. To everyone who sent in contributions as small at $5 and kept us going, thank you. Thank you from all of us. And to the young people in particular, I hope you will hear this. I have, as Tim said, spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I’ve had successes and I’ve had setbacks. Sometimes really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional public and political careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too. This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what’s right is worth it. It is – it is worth it. And so we need – we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives. And to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion. Now, I – I know – I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. And to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams. Finally, I am so grateful for our country and for all it has given to me. I count my blessings every single day that I am an American. And I still believe as deeply as I ever have that if we stand together and work together with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions and love for this nation, our best days are still ahead of us. Because, you know – you know, I believe we are stronger together and we will go forward together. And you should never, ever regret fighting for that. You know, scripture tells us: “Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap if we do not lose heart.” So my friends, let us have faith in each other, let us not grow weary, let us not lose heart, for there are more seasons to come. And there is more work to do. I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America\"\n",

            "  \"Text\": \" Thank you, Reno! It’s great to be back in Nevada...     My original plan for this visit was to focus on our agenda to help small businesses and entrepreneurs. This week we proposed new steps to cut red tape and taxes, and make it easier for small businesses to get the credit they need to grow and hire. Because I believe that in America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it. We’ll be talking a lot more about our economic plans in the days and weeks ahead. But today, I want to address something I hear from Americans all over our country. Everywhere I go, people tell me how concerned they are by the divisive rhetoric coming from my opponent in this election. It’s like nothing we’ve heard before from a nominee for President of the United States. From the start, Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. He’s taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over one of America’s two major political parties. His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous. In just the past week, under the guise of “outreach” to African Americans, Trump has stood up in front of largely white audiences and described black communities in insulting and ignorant terms: “Poverty. Rejection. Horrible education. No housing. No homes. No ownership. Crime at levels nobody has seen… Right now, you walk down the street, you get shot.” Those are his words. Donald Trump misses so much. He doesn’t see the success of black leaders in every field… The vibrancy of black-owned businesses…Or the strength of the black church… He doesn’t see the excellence of historically black colleges and universities or the pride of black parents watching their children thrive…And he certainly doesn’t have any solutions to take on the reality of systemic racism and create more equity and opportunity in communities of color. It takes a lot of nerve to ask people he’s ignored and mistreated for decades, “What do you have to lose?” The answer is everything! Trump’s lack of knowledge or experience or solutions would be bad enough. But what he’s doing here is more sinister. Trump is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters. It’s a disturbing preview of what kind of President he’d be. This is what I want to make clear today: A man with a long history of racial discrimination, who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far reaches of the internet, should never run our government or command our military.

Trump golf club worker says she was sexually harassed, tricked into signing NDA If he doesn’t respect all Americans, how can he serve all Americans? Now, I know some people still want to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. They hope that he will eventually reinvent himself – that there’s a kinder, gentler, more responsible Donald Trump waiting in the wings somewhere. After all, it’s hard to believe anyone – let alone a nominee for President of the United States – could really believe all the things he says. But the hard truth is, there’s no other Donald Trump. This is it. Maya Angelou once said: “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” Well, throughout his career and this campaign, Donald Trump has shown us exactly who he is. We should believe him. When Trump was getting his start in business, he was sued by the Justice Department for refusing to rent apartments to black and Latino tenants. Their applications would be marked with a “C” – “C” for “colored” – and then rejected. Three years later, the Justice Department took Trump back to court because he hadn’t changed. The pattern continued through the decades. State regulators fined one of Trump’s casinos for repeatedly removing black dealers from the floor. No wonder the turn-over rate for his minority employees was way above average. And let’s not forget Trump first gained political prominence leading the charge for the so-called “Birthers.” He promoted the racist lie that President Obama isn’t really an American citizen – part of a sustained effort to delegitimize America’s first black President. In 2015, Trump launched his own campaign for President with another racist lie. He described Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals. And he accused the Mexican government of actively sending them across the border. None of that is true. Oh, and by the way, Mexico’s not paying for his wall either. If it ever gets built, you can be sure that American taxpayers will be stuck with the bill. Since then, there’s been a steady stream of bigotry. We all remember when Trump said a distinguished federal judge born in Indiana couldn’t be trusted to do his job because, quote, “He’s a Mexican.” Think about that. The man who today is the standard bearer of the Republican Party said a federal judge was incapable of doing his job solely because of his heritage. Even the Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, described that as “the textbook definition of a racist comment.” To this day, he’s never apologized to Judge Curiel. But for Trump, that’s just par for the course. This is someone who retweets white supremacists online, like the user who goes by the name “white-genocide-TM.” Trump took this fringe bigot with a few dozen followers and spread his message to 11 million people. His campaign famously posted an anti-Semitic image – a Star of David imposed over a sea of dollar bills – that first appeared on a white supremacist website. The Trump campaign also selected a prominent white nationalist leader as a delegate in California. They only dropped him under pressure. When asked in a nationally televised interview whether he would disavow the support of David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, Trump wouldn’t do it. Only later, again under mounting pressure, did he backtrack. And when Trump was asked about anti-Semitic slurs and death threats coming from his supporters, he refused to condemn them. Through it all, he has continued pushing discredited conspiracy theories with racist undertones. Trump said thousands of American Muslims in New Jersey cheered the 9/11 attacks. They didn’t. He suggested that Ted Cruz’s father was involved in the Kennedy assassination. Perhaps in Trump’s mind, because he was a Cuban immigrant, he must have had something to do with it. Of course there’s absolutely no evidence of that. Just recently, Trump claimed President Obama founded ISIS. And then he repeated that nonsense over and over. His latest paranoid fever dream is about my health. All I can say is, Donald, dream on. This is what happens when you treat the National Enquirer like Gospel. It’s what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs. He said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there. Trump didn’t challenge those lies. He went on Jones’ show and said: “Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.” This man wants to be President of the United States. I’ve stood by President Obama’s side as he made the toughest decisions a Commander-in-Chief ever has to make. In times of crisis, our country depends on steady leadership… clear thinking… and calm judgment… because one wrong move can mean the difference between life and death. The last thing we need in the Situation Room is a loose cannon who can’t tell the difference between fact and fiction, and who buys so easily into racially-tinged rumors. Someone detached from reality should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come. It’s another reason why Donald Trump is simply temperamentally unfit to be President of the United States. Now, some people will say that his bluster and bigotry is just over-heated campaign rhetoric – an outrageous person saying outrageous things for attention. But look at the policies Trump has proposed. They would put prejudice into practice. And don’t be distracted by his latest attempts to muddy the waters. He may have some new people putting new words in his mouth… but we know where he stands. He would form a deportation force to round up millions of immigrants and kick them out of the country. He’d abolish the bedrock constitutional principle that says if you’re born in the United States, you’re an American citizen. He says that children born in America to undocumented parents are, quote, “anchor babies” and should be deported. Millions of them. And he’d ban Muslims around the world – 1.5 billion men, women, and children –from entering our country just because of their religion. Think about that for a minute. How would it actually work? People landing in U.S. airports would line up to get their passports stamped, just like they do now. But in Trump’s America, when they step up to the counter, the immigration officer would ask every single person, “What is your religion?” And then what? What if someone says, “I’m a Christian,” but the agent doesn’t believe them. Do they have to prove it? How would they do that? Ever since the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock, America has distinguished itself as a haven for people fleeing religious persecution. Under Donald Trump, America would distinguish itself as the only country in the world to impose a religious test at the border. Come to think of it, there actually may be one place that does that. It’s the so-called Islamic State. The territory ISIS controls. It would be a cruel irony if America followed its lead. Don’t worry, some will say, as President, Trump will be surrounded by smart advisors who will rein in his worst impulses. So when a tweet gets under his skin and he wants to retaliate with a cruise missile, maybe cooler heads will be there to convince him not to. Maybe. But look at who he’s put in charge of his campaign. Trump likes to say he only hires the “best people.” But he’s had to fire so many campaign managers it’s like an episode of the Apprentice. The latest shake-up was designed to – quote – “Let Trump be Trump.” To do that, he hired Stephen Bannon, the head of a right-wing website called Breitbart.com, as campaign CEO. To give you a flavor of his work, here are a few headlines they’ve published: “Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy.” “Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism or Cancer?” “Gabby Giffords: The Gun Control Movement’s Human Shield” “Hoist It High And Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims A Glorious Heritage.” That one came shortly after the Charleston massacre, when Democrats and Republicans alike were doing everything they could to heal racial divides. Breitbart tried to enflame them further. Just imagine – Donald Trump reading that and thinking: “this is what I need more of in my campaign.” Bannon has nasty things to say about pretty much everyone. This spring, he railed against Paul Ryan for, quote “rubbing his social-justice Catholicism in my nose every second.” No wonder he’s gone to work for Trump – the only Presidential candidate ever to get into a public feud with the Pope. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, Breitbart embraces “ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right. Racist ideas. Race-baiting ideas. Anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideas –– all key tenets making up an emerging racist ideology known as the ‘Alt-Right.’” Alt-Right is short for “Alternative Right.” The Wall Street Journal describes it as a loosely organized movement, mostly online, that “rejects mainstream conservatism, promotes nationalism and views immigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity.” The de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump Campaign represents a landmark achievement for the “Alt-Right.” A fringe element has effectively taken over the Republican Party. This is part of a broader story -- the rising tide of hardline, right-wing nationalism around the world. Just yesterday, one of Britain’s most prominent right-wing leaders, Nigel Farage, who stoked anti-immigrant sentiments to win the referendum on leaving the European Union, campaigned with Donald Trump in Mississippi. Farage has called for a ban on the children of legal immigrants from public schools and health services, has said women are quote “worth less” than men, and supports scrapping laws that prevent employers from discriminating based on race -- that’s who Trump wants by his side. The godfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism is Russian President Vladimir Putin. In fact, Farage has appeared regularly on Russian propaganda programs. Now he’s standing on the same stage as the Republican nominee. Trump himself heaps praise on Putin and embrace pro-Russian policies. He talks casually of abandoning our NATO allies, recognizing Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and of giving the Kremlin a free hand in Eastern Europe more generally. American presidents from Truman to Reagan have rejected the kind of approach Trump is taking on Russia. We should, too. All of this adds up to something we’ve never seen before. Of course there’s always been a paranoid fringe in our politics, steeped in racial resentment. But it’s never had the nominee of a major party stoking it, encouraging it, and giving it a national megaphone. Until now. On David Duke’s radio show the other day, the mood was jubilant. “We appear to have taken over the Republican Party,” one white supremacist said. Duke laughed. There’s still more work to do, he said. No one should have any illusions about what’s really going on here. The names may have changed… Racists now call themselves “racialists.” White supremacists now call themselves “white nationalists.” The paranoid fringe now calls itself “alt-right.” But the hate burns just as bright. And now Trump is trying to rebrand himself as well. Don’t be fooled. There’s an old Mexican proverb that says “Tell me with whom you walk, and I will tell you who you are.” We know who Trump is. A few words on a teleprompter won’t change that. He says he wants to “make America great again,” but his real message remains “Make America hate again.” This isn’t just about one election. It’s about who we are as a nation. It’s about the kind of example we want to set for our children and grandchildren. Next time you watch Donald Trump rant on television, think about all the kids listening across our country. They hear a lot more than we think. Parents and teachers are already worried about what they’re calling the “Trump Effect.” Bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants. At a recent high school basketball game in Indiana, white students held up Trump signs and taunted Latino players on the opposing team with chants of “Build the wall!” and “Speak English.” After a similar incident in Iowa, one frustrated school principal said, “They see it in a presidential campaign and now it’s OK for everyone to say this.” We wouldn’t tolerate that kind of behavior in our own homes. How can we stand for it from a candidate for president? This is a moment of reckoning for every Republican dismayed that the Party of Lincoln has become the Party of Trump. It’s a moment of reckoning for all of us who love our country and believe that America is better than this. Twenty years ago, when Bob Dole accepted the Republican nomination, he pointed to the exits and told any racists in the Party to get out. The week after 9/11, George W. Bush went to a mosque and declared for everyone to hear that Muslims “love America just as much as I do.” In 2008, John McCain told his own supporters they were wrong about the man he was trying to defeat. Senator McCain made sure they knew – Barack Obama is an American citizen and “a decent person.” We need that kind of leadership again. Every day, more Americans are standing up and saying “enough is enough” – including a lot of Republicans. I’m honored to have their support. And I promise you this: with your help, I will be a President for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. For those who vote for me and those who don’t. For all Americans. Because I believe we are stronger together. It’s a vision for the future rooted in our values and reflected in a rising generation of young people who are the most open, diverse, and connected we’ve ever seen. Just look at our fabulous Olympic team. Like Ibtihaj Muhammad, an African-American Muslim from New Jersey who won the bronze medal in fencing with grace and skill. Would she even have a place in Donald Trump’s America? When I was growing up, Simone Manuel wouldn’t have been allowed to swim in the same public pool as Katie Ledecky. Now they’re winning Olympic medals as teammates. So let’s keep moving forward together. Let’s stand up against prejudice and paranoia. Let’s prove once again, that America is great because is America is good. Thank you, and may God bless the United States.\"\n",

            "    \"Text\" : \"I spoke the other day of the colossal military disaster which occurred when the French High Command failed to withdraw the northern Armies from Belgium at the moment when they knew that the French front was decisively broken at Sedan and on the Meuse. This delay entailed the loss of fifteen or sixteen French divisions and threw out of action for the critical period the whole of the British Expeditionary Force. Our Army and 120,000 French troops were indeed rescued by the British Navy from Dunkirk but only with the loss of their cannon, vehicles and modern equipment. This loss inevitably took some weeks to repair, and in the first two of those weeks the battle in France has been lost. When we consider the heroic resistance made by the French Army against heavy odds in this battle, the enormous losses inflicted upon the enemy and the evident exhaustion of the enemy, it may well be the thought that these 25 divisions of the best-trained and best-equipped troops might have turned the scale. However, General Weygand had to fight without them. Only three British divisions or their equivalent were able to stand in the line with their French comrades. They have suffered severely, but they have fought well. We sent every man we could to France as fast as we could re-equip and transport their formations. I am not reciting these facts for the purpose of recrimination. That I judge to be utterly futile and even harmful. We cannot afford it. I recite them in order to explain why it was we did not have, as we could have had, between twelve and fourteen British divisions fighting in the line in this great battle instead of only three. Now I put all this aside. I put it on the shelf, from which the historians, when they have time, will select their documents to tell their stories. We have to think of the future and not of the past. This also applies in a small way to our own affairs at home. There are many who would hold an inquest in the House of Commons on the conduct of the Governments — and of Parliaments, for they are in it, too — during the years which led up to this catastrophe. They seek to indict those who were responsible for the guidance of our affairs. This also would be a foolish and pernicious process. There are too many in it. Let each man search his conscience and search his speeches. I frequently search mine. Of this I am quite sure, that if we open a quarrel between the past and the present, we shall find that we have lost the future. Therefore, I cannot accept the drawing of any distinctions between members of the present Government. It was formed at a moment of crisis in order to unite all the Parties and all sections of opinion. It has received the almost unanimous support of both Houses of Parliament. Its members are going to stand together, and, subject to the authority of the House of Commons, we are going to govern the country and fight the war. It is absolutely necessary at a time like this that every Minister who tries each day to do his duty shall be respected; and their subordinates must know that their chiefs are not threatened men, men who are here today and gone tomorrow, but that their directions must be punctually and faithfully obeyed. Without this concentrated power we cannot face what lies before us. I should not think it would be very advantageous for the House to prolong this debate this afternoon under conditions of public stress. Many facts are not clear that will be clear in a short time. We are to have a secret session on Thursday, and I should think that would be a better opportunity for the many earnest expressions of opinion which members will desire to make and for the House to discuss vital matters without having everything read the next morning by our dangerous foes. The disastrous military events which have happened during the past fortnight have not come to me with any sense of surprise. Indeed, I indicated a fortnight ago as clearly as I could to the House that the worst possibilities were open; and I made it perfectly clear that whatever happened in France would make no difference to the resolve of Britain and the British Empire to fight on, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. During the last few days we have successfully brought off the great majority of the troops we had on the line of communication in France; and seven-eighths of the troops we have sent to France since the beginning of the war — that is to say, about 350,000 out of 400,000 men — are safely back in this country. Others are still fighting with the French, and fighting with considerable success in their local encounters against the enemy. We have also brought back a great mass of stores, rifles and munitions of all kinds which had been accumulated in France during the last nine months. We have, therefore, in this Island today a very large and powerful military force. This force comprises all our best-trained and our finest troops, including scores of thousands of those who have already measured their quality against the Germans and found themselves at no disadvantage. We have under arms at the present time in this Island over a million and a quarter men. Behind these we have the Local Defense Volunteers, numbering half a million, only a portion of whom, however, are yet armed with rifles or other firearms. We have incorporated into our Defense Forces every man for whom we have a weapon. We expect very large additions to our weapons in the near future, and in preparation for this we intend forthwith to call up, drill and train further large numbers. Those who are not called up, or else are employed during the vast business of munitions production in all its branches — and their ramifications are innumerable — will serve their country best by remaining at their ordinary work until they receive their summons. We have also over here Dominions armies. The Canadians had actually landed in France, but have now been safely withdrawn, much disappointed, but in perfect order, with all their artillery and equipment. And these very high-class forces from the Dominions will now take part in the defense of the Mother Country. Lest the account which I have given of these large forces should raise the question: Why did they not take part in the great battle in France? I must make it clear that, apart from the divisions training and organizing at home, only twelve divisions were equipped to fight upon a scale which justified their being sent abroad. And this was fully up to the number which the French had been led to expect would be available in France at the ninth month of the war. The rest of our forces at home have a fighting value for home defense which will, of course, steadily increase every week that passes. Thus, the invasion of Great Britain would at this time require the transportation across the sea of hostile armies on a very large scale, and after they had been so transported they would have to be continually maintained with all the masses of munitions and supplies which are required for continuous battle — as continuous battle it will surely be. Here is where we come to the Navy — and after all, we have a Navy. Some people seem to forget that we have a Navy. We must remind them. For the last thirty years I have been concerned in discussions about the possibilities of oversea invasion, and I took the responsibility on behalf of the Admiralty, at the beginning of the last war, of allowing all regular troops to be sent out of the country. That was a very serious step to take, because our Territorials had only just been called up and were quite untrained. Therefore, this Island was for several months particularly denuded of fighting troops. The Admiralty had confidence at that time in their ability to prevent a mass invasion even though at that time the Germans had a magnificent battle fleet in the proportion of 10 to 16, even though they were capable of fighting a general engagement every day and any day, whereas now they have only a couple of heavy ships worth speaking of — the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau. We are also told that the Italian Navy is to come out and gain sea superiority in these waters. If they seriously intend it, I shall only say that we shall be delighted to offer Signor Mussolini a free and safeguarded passage through the Strait of Gibraltar in order that he may play the part to which he aspires. There is a general curiosity in the British Fleet to find out whether the Italians are up to the level they were at in the last war or whether they have fallen off at all. Therefore, it seems to me that as far as sea-borne invasion on a great scale is concerned, we are far more capable of meeting it today than we were at many periods in the last war and during the early months of this war, before our other troops were trained, and while the B.E.F. had proceeded abroad. Now, the Navy have never pretended to be able to prevent raids by bodies of 5,000 or 10,000 men flung suddenly across and thrown ashore at several points on the coast some dark night or foggy morning. The efficacy of sea power, especially under modern conditions, depends upon the invading force being of large size; It has to be of large size, in view of our military strength, to be of any use. If it is of large size, then the Navy have something they can find and meet and, as it were, bite on. Now, we must remember that even five divisions, however lightly equipped, would require 200 to 250 ships, and with modern air reconnaissance and photography it would not be easy to collect such an armada, marshal it, and conduct it across the sea without any powerful naval forces to escort it; and there would be very great possibilities, to put it mildly, that this armada would be intercepted long before it reached the coast, and all the men drowned in the sea or, at the worst blown to pieces with their equipment while they were trying to land. We also have a great system of minefields, recently strongly reinforced, through which we alone know the channels. If the enemy tries to sweep passages through these minefields, it will be the task of the Navy to destroy the mine-sweepers and any other forces employed to protect them. There should be no difficulty in this, owing to our great superiority at sea. Those are the regular, well-tested, well-proved arguments on which we have relied during many years in peace and war. But the question is whether there are any new methods by which those solid assurances can be circumvented. Odd as it may seem, some attention has been given to this by the Admiralty, whose prime duty and responsibility is to destroy any large sea-borne expedition before it reaches, or at the moment when it reaches, these shores. It would not be a good thing for me to go into details of this. It might suggest ideas to other people which they have not thought of, and they would not be likely to give us any of their ideas in exchange. All I will say is that untiring vigilance and mind-searching must be devoted to the subject, because the enemy is crafty and cunning and full of novel treacheries and stratagems. The House may be assured that the utmost ingenuity is being displayed and imagination is being evoked from large numbers of competent officers, well-trained in tactics and thoroughly up to date, to measure and counterwork novel possibilities. Untiring vigilance and untiring searching of the mind is being, and must be, devoted to the subject, because, remember, the enemy is crafty and there is no dirty trick he will not do. Some people will ask why, then, was it that the British Navy was not able to prevent the movement of a large army from Germany into Norway across the Skagerrak? But the conditions in the Channel and in the North Sea are in no way like those which prevail in the Skagerrak. In the Skagerrak, because of the distance, we could give no air support to our surface ships, and consequently, lying as we did close to the enemy's main air power, we were compelled to use only our submarines. We could not enforce the decisive blockade or interruption which is possible from surface vessels. Our submarines took a heavy toll but could not, by themselves, prevent the invasion of Norway. In the Channel and in the North Sea, on the other hand, our superior naval surface forces, aided by our submarines, will operate with close and effective air assistance. This brings me, naturally, to the great question of invasion from the air, and of the impending struggle between the British and German Air Forces. It seems quite clear that no invasion on a scale beyond the capacity of our land forces to crush speedily is likely to take place from the air until our Air Force has been definitely overpowered. In the meantime, there may be raids by parachute troops and attempted descents of airborne soldiers. We should be able to give those gentry a warm reception both in the air and on the ground, if they reach it in any condition to continue the dispute. But the great question is: Can we break Hitler's air weapon? Now, of course, it is a very great pity that we have not got an Air Force at least equal to that of the most powerful enemy within striking distance of these shores. But we have a very powerful Air Force which has proved itself far superior in quality, both in men and in many types of machine, to what we have met so far in the numerous and fierce air battles which have been fought with the Germans. In France, where we were at a considerable disadvantage and lost many machines on the ground when they were standing round the aerodromes, we were accustomed to inflict in the air losses of as much as two and two-and-a-half to one. In the fighting over Dunkirk, which was a sort of no-man's-land, we undoubtedly beat the German Air Force, and gained the mastery of the local air, inflicting here a loss of three or four to one day after day. Anyone who looks at the photographs which were published a week or so ago of the re-embarkation, showing the masses of troops assembled on the beach and forming an ideal target for hours at a time, must realize that this re-embarkation would not have been possible unless the enemy had resigned all hope of recovering air superiority at that time and at that place. In the defense of this Island the advantages to the defenders will be much greater than they were in the fighting around Dunkirk. We hope to improve on the rate of three or four to one which was realized at Dunkirk; and in addition all our injured machines and their crews which get down safely — and, surprisingly, a very great many injured machines and men do get down safely in modern air fighting — all of these will fall, in an attack upon these Islands, on friendly soil and live to fight another day; whereas all the injured enemy machines and their complements will be total losses as far as the war is concerned. During the great battle in France, we gave very powerful and continuous aid to the French Army, both by fighters and bombers; but in spite of every kind of pressure we never would allow the entire metropolitan fighter strength of the Air Force to be consumed. This decision was painful, but it was also right, because the fortunes of the battle in France could not have been decisively affected even if we had thrown in our entire fighter force. That battle was lost by the unfortunate strategical opening, by the extraordinary and unforseen power of the armored columns, and by the great preponderance of the German Army in numbers. Our fighter Air Force might easily have been exhausted as a mere accident in that great struggle, and then we should have found ourselves at the present time in a very serious plight. But as it is, I am happy to inform the House that our fighter strength is stronger at the present time relatively to the Germans, who have suffered terrible losses, than it has ever been; and consequently we believe ourselves possessed of the capacity to continue the war in the air under better conditions than we have ever experienced before. I look forward confidently to the exploits of our fighter pilots — these splendid men, this brilliant youth — who will have the glory of saving their native land, their island home, and all they love, from the most deadly of all attacks. There remains, of course, the danger of bombing attacks, which will certainly be made very soon upon us by the bomber forces of the enemy. It is true that the German bomber force is superior in numbers to ours; but we have a very large bomber force also, which we shall use to strike at military targets in Germany without intermission. I do not at all underrate the severity of the ordeal which lies before us; but I believe our countrymen will show themselves capable of standing up to it, like the brave men of Barcelona, and will be able to stand up to it, and carry on in spite of it, at least as well as any other people in the world. Much will depend upon this; every man and every woman will have the chance to show the finest qualities of their race, and render the highest service to their cause. For all of us, at this time, whatever our sphere, our station, our occupation or our duties, it will be a help to remember the famous lines: He nothing common did or mean, Upon that memorable scene. I have thought it right upon this occasion to give the House and the country some indication of the solid, practical grounds upon which we base our inflexible resolve to continue the war. There are a good many people who say, 'Never mind. Win or lose, sink or swim, better die than submit to tyranny — and such a tyranny.' And I do not dissociate myself from them. But I can assure them that our professional advisers of the three Services unitedly advise that we should carry on the war, and that there are good and reasonable hopes of final victory. We have fully informed and consulted all the self-governing Dominions, these great communities far beyond the oceans who have been built up on our laws and on our civilization, and who are absolutely free to choose their course, but are absolutely devoted to the ancient Motherland, and who feel themselves inspired by the same emotions which lead me to stake our all upon duty and honor. We have fully consulted them, and I have received from their Prime Ministers, Mr. Mackenzie King of Canada, Mr. Menzies of Australia, Mr. Fraser of New Zealand, and General Smuts of South Africa — that wonderful man, with his immense profound mind, and his eye watching from a distance the whole panorama of European affairs — I have received from all these eminent men, who all have Governments behind them elected on wide franchises, who are all there because they represent the will of their people, messages couched in the most moving terms in which they endorse our decision to fight on, and declare themselves ready to share our fortunes and to persevere to the end. That is what we are going to do. We may now ask ourselves: In what way has our position worsened since the beginning of the war? It has worsened by the fact that the Germans have conquered a large part of the coast line of Western Europe, and many small countries have been overrun by them. This aggravates the possibilities of air attack and adds to our naval preoccupations. It in no way diminishes, but on the contrary definitely increases, the power of our long-distance blockade. Similarly, the entrance of Italy into the war increases the power of our long-distance blockade. We have stopped the worst leak by that. We do not know whether military resistance will come to an end in France or not, but should it do so, then of course the Germans will be able to concentrate their forces, both military and industrial, upon us. But for the reasons I have given to the House these will not be found so easy to apply. If invasion has become more imminent, as no doubt it has, we, being relieved from the task of maintaining a large army in France, have far larger and more efficient forces to meet it. If Hitler can bring under his despotic control the industries of the countries he has conquered, this will add greatly to his already vast armament output. On the other hand, this will not happen immediately, and we are now assured of immense, continuous and increasing support in supplies and munitions of all kinds from the United States; and especially of aeroplanes and pilots from the Dominions and across the oceans coming from regions which are beyond the reach of enemy bombers. I do not see how any of these factors can operate to our detriment on balance before the winter comes; and the winter will impose a strain upon the Nazi regime, with almost all Europe writhing and starving under its cruel heel, which, for all their ruthlessness, will run them very hard. We must not forget that from the moment when we declared war on the 3rd September it was always possible for Germany to turn all her Air Force upon this country, together with any other devices of invasion she might conceive, and that France could have done little or nothing to prevent her doing so. We have, therefore, lived under this danger, in principle and in a slightly modified form, during all these months. In the meanwhile, however, we have enormously improved our methods of defense, and we have learned what we had no right to assume at the beginning, namely, that the individual aircraft and the individual British pilot have a sure and definite superiority. Therefore, in casting up this dread balance sheet and contemplating our dangers with a disillusioned eye, I see great reason for intense vigilance and exertion, but none whatever for panic or despair. During the first four years of the last war the Allies experienced nothing but disaster and disappointment. That was our constant fear: one blow after another, terrible losses, frightful dangers. Everything miscarried. And yet at the end of those four years the morale of the Allies was higher than that of the Germans, who had moved from one aggressive triumph to another, and who stood everywhere triumphant invaders of the lands into which they had broken. During that war we repeatedly asked ourselves the question: 'How are we going to win?' And no one was able ever to answer it with much precision, until at the end, quite suddenly, quite unexpectedly, our terrible foe collapsed before us, and we were so glutted with victory that in our folly we threw it away. We do not yet know what will happen in France or whether the French resistance will be prolonged, both in France and in the French Empire overseas. The French Government will be throwing away great opportunities and casting adrift their future if they do not continue the war in accordance with their treaty obligations, from which we have not felt able to release them. The House will have read the historic declaration in which, at the desire of many Frenchmen — and of our own hearts — we have proclaimed our willingness at the darkest hour in French history to conclude a union of common citizenship in this struggle. However matters may go in France or with the French Government, or other French Governments, we in this Island and in the British Empire will never lose our sense of comradeship with the French people. If we are now called upon to endure what they have been suffering, we shall emulate their courage, and if final victory rewards our toils they shall share the gains, aye, and freedom shall be restored to all. We abate nothing of our just demands; not one jot or tittle do we recede. Czechs, Poles, Norwegians, Dutch, Belgians have joined their causes to our own. All these shall be restored. What General Weygand called the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization. Upon it depends our own British life, and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire. The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands. But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.'\"\n",

            "    \"Text\" : \"From the moment that the French defences at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken at the end of the second week of May, only a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and French Armies who had entered Belgium at the appeal of the Belgian King; but this strategic fact was not immediately realised. The French High Command hoped they would be able to close the gap, and the Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have involved almost certainly the destruction of the fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the abandonment of the whole of Belgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German penetration were realised and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed command in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a newly created French Army which was to have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it. However, the German eruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of the north. Eight or nine armoured divisions, each of about four hundred armoured vehicles of different kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and divisible into small self-contained units, cut off all communications between us and the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for food and ammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it shore its way up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk. Behind this armoured and mechanised onslaught came a number of German divisions in lorries, and behind them again there plodded comparatively slowly the dull brute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people, always so ready to be led to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which they have never known in their own. I have said this armoured scythe-stroke almost reached Dunkirk-almost but not quite. Boulogne and Calais were the scenes of desperate fighting. The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were then withdrawn by orders from this country. The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles, and the Queen Victoria's Rifles, with a battalion of British tanks and 1,000 Frenchmen, in all about four thousand strong, defended Calais to the last. The British Brigadier was given an hour to surrender. He spurned the offer, and four days of intense street fighting passed before silence reigned over Calais, which marked the end of a memorable resistance. Only 30 unwounded survivors were brought off by the Navy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades. Their sacrifice, however, was not in vain. At least two armoured divisions, which otherwise would have been turned against the British Expeditionary Force, had to be sent to overcome them. They have added another page to the glories of the light divisions, and the time gained enabled the Graveline water lines to be flooded and to be held by the French troops. Thus it was that the port of Dunkirk was kept open. When it was found impossible for the Armies of the north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies, only one choice remained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn. The Belgian, British and French Armies were almost surrounded. Their sole line of retreat was to a single port and to its neighboring beaches. They were pressed on every side by heavy attacks and far outnumbered in the air. When, a week ago today, I asked the House to fix this afternoon as the occasion for a statement, I feared it would be my hard lot to announce the greatest military disaster in our long history. I thought - and some good judges agreed with me -that perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 men might be re-embarked. But it certainly seemed that the whole of the French First Army and the whole of the British Expeditionary Force north of the Amiens-Abbeville gap would be broken up in the open field or else would have to capitulate for lack of food and ammunition. These were the hard and heavy tidings for which I called upon the House and the nation to prepare themselves a week ago. The whole root and core and brain of the British Army, on which and around which we were to build, and are to build, the great British Armies in the later years of the war, seemed about to perish upon the field or to be led into an ignominious and starving captivity. That was the prospect a week ago. But another blow which might well have proved final was yet to fall upon us. The King of the Belgians had called upon us to come to his aid. Had not this Ruler and his Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued their country from extinction in the late war, and had they not sought refuge in what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French and British Armies might well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland. Yet at the last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called upon us to come to his aid, and even at the last moment we came. He and his brave, efficient Army, nearly half a million strong, guarded our left flank and thus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without prior consultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his Ministers and upon his own personal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the German Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed our whole flank and means of retreat. I asked the House a week ago to suspend its judgement because the facts were not clear, but I do not feel that any reason now exists why we should not form our own opinions upon this pitiful episode. The surrender of the Belgian Army compelled the British at the shortest notice to cover a flank to the sea more than 30 miles in length. Otherwise all would have been cut off, and all would have shared the fate to which King Leopold had condemned the finest Army his country had ever formed. So in doing this and in exposing this flank, as anyone who followed the operations on the map will see, contact was lost between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army, who were still farther from the coast than we were, and it seemed impossible that any large number of Allied troops could reach the coast. The enemy attacked on all sides with great strength and fierceness, and their main power, the power of their far more numerous Air Force, was thrown into the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk and the beaches. Pressing in upon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy began to fire with cannon upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or depart. They sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas; they sent repeated waves of hostile aircraft, sometimes more than a hundred strong in one formation, to cast their bombs upon the single pier that remained, and upon the sand dunes upon which the troops had their eyes for shelter. Their U-boats, one of which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic which now began. For four or five days an intense struggle reigned. All their armoured divisions - or what was left of them - together with great masses of infantry and artillery, hurled themselves in vain upon the ever-narrowing, ever-contracting appendix within which the British and French Armies fought. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy, with the willing help of countless merchant seamen, strained every nerve to embark the British and Allied troops; 220 light warships and 650 other vessels were engaged. They had to operate upon the difficult coast, often in adverse weather, under an almost ceaseless hail of bombs and an increasing concentration of artillery fire. Nor were the seas, as I have said, themselves free from mines and torpedoes. It was in conditions such as these that our men carried on, with little or no rest, for days and nights on end, making trip after trip across the dangerous waters, bringing with them always men whom they had rescued. The numbers they have brought back are the measure of their devotion and their courage. The hospital ships, which brought off many thousands of British and French wounded, being so plainly marked were a special target for Nazi bombs; but the men and women on board them never faltered in their duty. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force, which had already been intervening in the battle, so far as its range would allow, from home bases, now used part of its main metropolitan fighter strength, and struck at the German bombers and at the fighters which in large numbers protected them. This struggle was protracted and fierce. Suddenly the scene has cleared, the crash and thunder has for the moment - but only for the moment - died away. A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valour, by perseverance, by perfect discipline, by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable fidelity, is manifest to us all. The enemy was hurled back by the retreating British and French troops. He was so roughly handled that he did not hurry their departure seriously. The Royal Air Force engaged the main strength of the German Air Force, and inflicted upon them losses of at least four to one; and the Navy, using nearly 1,000 ships of all kinds, carried over 335,000 men, French and British, out of the jaws of death and shame, to their native land and to the tasks which lie immediately ahead. We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations. But there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted. It was gained by the Air Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the Air Force at work; they saw only the bombers which escaped its protective attack. They underrate its achievements. I have heard much talk of this; that is why I go out of my way to say this. I will tell you about it. This was a great trial of strength between the British and German Air Forces. Can you conceive a greater objective for the Germans in the air than to make evacuation from these beaches impossible, and to sink all these ships which were displayed, almost to the extent of thousands? Could there have been an objective of greater military importance and significance for the whole purpose of the war than this? They tried hard, and they were beaten back; they were frustrated in their task. We got the Army away; and they have paid fourfold for any losses which they have inflicted. Very large formations of German aeroplanes - and we know that they are a very brave race - have turned on several occasions from the attack of one-quarter of their number of the Royal Air Force, and have dispersed in different directions. Twelve aeroplanes have been hunted by two. One aeroplane was driven into the water and cast away by the mere charge of a British aeroplane, which had no more ammunition. All of our types - the Hurricane, the Spitfire and the new Defiant - and all our pilots have been vindicated as superior to what they have at present to face. When we consider how much greater would be our advantage in defending the air above this Island against an overseas attack, I must say that I find in these facts a sure basis upon which practical and reassuring thoughts may rest. I will pay my tribute to these young airmen. The great French Army was very largely, for the time being, cast back and disturbed by the onrush of a few thousands of armoured vehicles. May it not also be that the cause of civilisation itself will be defended by the skill and devotion of a few thousand airmen? There never has been, I suppose, in all the world, in all the history of war, such an opportunity for youth. The Knights of the Round Table, the Crusaders, all fall back into the past - not only distant but prosaic; these young men, going forth every morn to guard their native land and all that we stand for, holding in their hands these instruments of colossal and shattering power, of whom it may be said that Every morn brought forth a noble chance And every chance brought forth a noble knight, deserve our gratitude, as do all the brave men who, in so many ways and on so many occasions, are ready, and continue ready to give life and all for their native land. I return to the Army. In the long series of very fierce battles, now on this front, now on that, fighting on three fronts at once, battles fought by two or three divisions against an equal or somewhat larger number of the enemy, and fought fiercely on some of the old grounds that so many of us knew so well - in these battles our losses in men have exceeded 30,000 killed, wounded and missing. I take occasion to express the sympathy of the House to all who have suffered bereavement or who are still anxious. The President of the Board of Trade [Sir Andrew Duncan] is not here today. His son has been killed, and many in the House have felt the pangs of affliction in the sharpest form. But I will say this about the missing: We have had a large number of wounded come home safely to this country, but I would say about the missing that there may be very many reported missing who will come back home, some day, in one way or another. In the confusion of this fight it is inevitable that many have been left in positions where honour required no further resistance from them. Against this loss of over 30,000 men, we can set a far heavier loss certainly inflicted upon the enemy. But our losses in material are enormous. We have perhaps lost one-third of the men we lost in the opening days of the battle of 21st March, 1918, but we have lost nearly as many guns — nearly one thousand - and all our transport, all the armoured vehicles that were with the Army in the north. This loss will impose a further delay on the expansion of our military strength. That expansion had not been proceeding as far as we had hoped. The best of all we had to give had gone to the British Expeditionary Force, and although they had not the numbers of tanks and some articles of equipment which were desirable, they were a very well and finely equipped Army. They had the first-fruits of all that our industry had to give, and that is gone. And now here is this further delay. How long it will be, how long it will last, depends upon the exertions which we make in this Island. An effort the like of which has never been seen in our records is now being made. Work is proceeding everywhere, night and day, Sundays and week days. Capital and Labour have cast aside their interests, rights, and customs and put them into the common stock. Already the flow of munitions has leaped forward. There is no reason why we should not in a few months overtake the sudden and serious loss that has come upon us, without retarding the development of our general program. Nevertheless, our thankfulness at the escape of our Army and so many men, whose loved ones have passed through an agonising week, must not blind us to the fact that what has happened in France and Belgium is a colossal military disaster. The French Army has been weakened, the Belgian Army has been lost, a large part of those fortified lines upon which so much faith had been reposed is gone, many valuable mining districts and factories have passed into the enemy's possession, the whole of the Channel ports are in his hands, with all the tragic consequences that follow from that, and we must expect another blow to be struck almost immediately at us or at France. We are told that Herr Hitler has a plan for invading the British Isles. This has often been thought of before. When Napoleon lay at Boulogne for a year with his flat-bottomed boats and his Grand Army, he was told by someone. \\\"There are bitter weeds in England.\\\" There are certainly a great many more of them since the British Expeditionary Force returned. The whole question of home defence against invasion is, of course, powerfully affected by the fact that we have for the time being in this Island incomparably more powerful military forces than we have ever had at any moment in this war or the last. But this will not continue. We shall not be content with a defensive war. We have our duty to our Ally. We have to reconstitute and build up the British Expeditionary Force once again, under its gallant Commander-in-Chief, Lord Gort. All this is in train; but in the interval we must put our defences in this Island into such a high state of organisation that the fewest possible numbers will be required to give effective security and that the largest possible potential of offensive effort may be realised. On this we are now engaged. It will be very convenient, if it be the desire of the House, to enter upon this subject in a secret Session. Not that the government would necessarily be able to reveal in very great detail military secrets, but we like to have our discussions free, without the restraint imposed by the fact that they will be read the next day by the enemy; and the Government would benefit by views freely expressed in all parts of the House by Members with their knowledge of so many different parts of the country. I understand that some request is to be made upon this subject, which will be readily acceded to by His Majesty's Government. We have found it necessary to take measures of increasing stringency, not only against enemy aliens and suspicious characters of other nationalities, but also against British subjects who may become a danger or a nuisance should the war be transported to the United Kingdom. I know there are a great many people affected by the orders which we have made who are the passionate enemies of Nazi Germany. I am very sorry for them, but we cannot, at the present time and under the present stress, draw all the distinctions which we should like to do. If parachute landings were attempted and fierce fighting attendant upon them followed, these unfortunate people would be far better out of the way, for their own sakes as well as for ours. There is, however, another class, for which I feel not the slightest sympathy. Parliament has given us the powers to put down Fifth Column activities with a strong hand, and we shall use those powers subject to the supervision and correction of the House, without the slightest hesitation until we are satisfied, and more than satisfied, that this malignancy in our midst has been effectively stamped out. Turning once again, and this time more generally, to the question of invasion, I would observe that there has never been a period in all these long centuries of which we boast when an absolute guarantee against invasion, still less against serious raids, could have been given to our people. In the days of Napoleon the same wind which would have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven away the blockading fleet. There was always the chance, and it is that chance which has excited and befooled the imaginations of many Continental tyrants. Many are the tales that are told. We are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of malice, the ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind of novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous maneuver. I think that no idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered and viewed with a searching, but at the same time, I hope, with a steady eye. We must never forget the solid assurances of sea power and those which belong to air power if it can be locally exercised. I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty's Government - every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.\"\n",

            "    \"Text\" : \"I speak to you for the first time as Prime Minister in a solemn hour for the life of our country, of our empire, of our allies, and, above all, of the cause of freedom. A tremendous battle is raging in France and Flanders. The Germans, by a remarkable combination of air bombing and heavily armored tanks, have broken through the French defenses north of the Maginot Line, and strong columns of their armored vehicles are ravaging the open country, which for the first day or two was without defenders. They have penetrated deeply and spread alarm and confusion in their track. Behind them there are now appearing infantry in lorries, and behind them, again, the large masses are moving forward. The re-groupment of the French armies to make head against, and also to strike at, this intruding wedge has been proceeding for several days, largely assisted by the magnificent efforts of the Royal Air Force. We must not allow ourselves to be intimidated by the presence of these armored vehicles in unexpected places behind our lines. If they are behind our Front, the French are also at many points fighting actively behind theirs. Both sides are therefore in [an] extremely dangerous position. And if the French Army and our own Army are well handled, as I believe they will be, if the French retain that genius for recovery and counter-attack for which they have so long been famous, and if the British Army shows the dogged endurance and solid fighting power of which there have been so many examples in the past, then a sudden transformation of the scene might spring into being. Now it would be foolish, however, to disguise the gravity of the hour. It would be still more foolish to lose heart and courage or to suppose that well-trained, well-equipped armies numbering three or four millions of men can be overcome in the space of a few weeks, or even months, by a scoop, or raid of mechanized vehicles, however formidable. We may look with confidence to the stabilization of the Front in France, and to the general engagement of the masses, which will enable the qualities of the French and British soldiers to be matched squarely against those of their adversaries. For myself, I have invincible confidence in the French Army and its leaders. Only a very small part of that splendid Army has yet been heavily engaged; and only a very small part of France has yet been invaded. There is a good evidence to show that practically the whole of the specialized and mechanized forces of the enemy have been already thrown into the battle; and we know that very heavy losses have been inflicted upon them. No officer or man, no brigade or division, which grapples at close quarters with the enemy, wherever encountered, can fail to make a worthy contribution to the general result. The Armies must cast away the idea of resisting attack behind concrete lines or natural obstacles, and must realize that mastery can only be regained by furious and unrelenting assault. And this spirit must not only animate the High Command, but must inspire every fighting man. In the air — often at serious odds, often at odds hitherto thought overwhelming — we have been clawing down three or four to one of our enemies; and the relative balance of the British and German Air Forces is now considerably more favorable to us than at the beginning of the battle. In cutting down the German bombers, we are fighting our own battle as well as that of France. My confidence in our ability to fight it out to the finish with the German Air Force has been strengthened by the fierce encounters which have taken place and are taking place. At the same time, our heavy bombers are striking nightly at the tap-root of German mechanized power, and have already inflicted serious damage upon the oil refineries on which the Nazi effort to dominate the world directly depends. We must expect that as soon as stability is reached on the Western Front, the bulk of that hideous apparatus of aggression which gashed Holland into ruin and slavery in a few days will be turned upon us. I am sure I speak for all when I say we are ready to face it, to endure it, and to retaliate against it to any extent that the unwritten laws of war permit. There will be many men and many women in this Island who, when the ordeal comes upon them, as come it will, will feel comfort, and even a pride, that they are sharing the perils of our lads at the Front — soldiers, sailors, and airmen — God bless them — and are drawing away from them a part at least of the onslaught they have to bear. Is not this the appointed time for all to make the utmost exertions in their power? If the battle is to be won, we must provide our men with ever-increasing quantities of the weapons and ammunition they need. We must have, and have quickly, more aeroplanes, more tanks, more shells, more guns. There is imperious need for these vital munitions. They increase our strength against the powerfully armed enemy. They replace the wastage of the obstinate struggle — and the knowledge that wastage will speedily be replaced enables us to draw more readily upon our reserves and throw them in now that everything counts so much. Our task is not only to win the battle — but to win the war. After this battle in France abates its force, there will come the battle for our Island — for all that Britain is, and all the Britain means. That will be the struggle. In that supreme emergency we shall not hesitate to take every step, even the most drastic, to call forth from our people the last ounce and the last inch of effort of which they are capable. The interests of property, the hours of labor, are nothing compared to the struggle for life and honor, for right and freedom, to which we have vowed ourselves. I have received from the Chiefs of the French Republic, and in particular from its indomitable Prime Minister, Monsieur Reynaud, the most sacred pledges that whatever happens they will fight to the end, be it bitter or be it glorious. Nay, if we fight to the end, it can only be glorious. Having received His Majesty's commission, I have formed an Administration of men and women of every Party and of almost every point of view. We have differed and quarreled in the past, but now one bond unites us all: to wage war until victory is won, and never to surrender ourselves to servitude and shame, whatever the cost and the agony may be. This is one of the most awe-striking periods in the long history of France and Britain. It is also beyond doubt the most sublime. Side by side, unaided except by their kith and kin in the great Dominions and by the wide empires which rest beneath their shield — side by side the British and French peoples have advanced to rescue not only Europe but mankind from the foulest and most soul-destroying tyranny which has ever darkened and stained the pages of history. Behind them, behind us, behind the Armies and Fleets of Britain and France, gather a group of shattered States and bludgeoned races: the Czechs, the Poles, the Norwegians, the Danes, the Dutch, the Belgians — upon all of whom the long night of barbarism will descend, unbroken even by a star of hope, unless we conquer, as conquer we must, as conquer we shall. Today is Trinity Sunday. Centuries ago words were written to be a call and a spur to the faithful servants of truth and justice: Arm yourselves, and be ye men of valour, and be in readiness for the conflict; for it is better for us to perish in battle than to look upon the outrage of our nation and our altars. As the will of God is in Heaven, even so let it be.\"\n",

On Friday evening last I received His Majesty's Commission to form a new Administration. It as the evident wish and will of Parliament and the nation that this should be conceived on the broadest possible basis and that it should include all parties, both those who supported the late Government and also the parties of the Opposition. I have completed the most important part of this task. A War Cabinet has been formed of five Members, representing, with the Opposition Liberals, the unity of the nation. The three party Leaders have agreed to serve, either in the War Cabinet or in high executive office. The three Fighting Services have been filled. It was necessary that this should be done in one single day, on account of the extreme urgency and rigour of events. A number of other positions, key positions, were filled yesterday, and I am submitting a further list to His Majesty tonight. I hope to complete the appointment of the principal Ministers during tomorrow. The appointment of the other Ministers usually takes a little longer, but I trust that, when Parliament meets again, this part of my task will be completed, and that the administration will be complete in all respects. I considered it in the public interest to suggest that the House should be summoned to meet today. Mr Speaker agreed, and took the necessary steps, in accordance with the powers conferred upon him by the Resolution of the House. At the end of the proceedings today, the Adjournment of the House will be proposed until Tuesday, 21st May, with, of course, provision for earlier meeting, if need be. The business to be considered during that week will be notified to Members at the earliest opportunity. I now invite the House, by the Motion which stands in my name, to record its approval of the steps taken and to declare its confidence in the new Government. To form an Administration of this scale and complexity is a serious undertaking in itself, but it must be remembered that we are in the preliminary stage of one of the greatest battles in history, that we are in action at many other points in Norway and in Holland, that we have to be prepared in the Mediterranean, that the air battle is continuous and that many preparations, such as have been indicated by my hon. Friend below the Gangway, have to be made here at home. In this crisis I hope I may be pardoned if I do not address the House at any length today. I hope that any of my friends and colleagues, or former colleagues, who are affected by the political reconstruction, will make allowance, all allowance, for any lack of ceremony with which it has been necessary to act. I would say to the House, as I said to those who have joined this Government: \\\"I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.\\\" We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask, what is our policy? I can say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: It is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival. Let that be realised; no survival for the British Empire, no survival for all that the British Empire has stood for, no survival for the urge and impulse of the ages, that mankind will move forward towards its goal. But I take up my task with buoyancy and hope. I feel sure that our cause will not be suffered to fail among men. At this time I feel entitled to claim the aid of all, and I say, \\\"Come then, let us go forward together with our united strength.\\\"\"\n",

            "    \"Text\" : \"Almost a year has passed since the war began, and it is natural for us, I think, to pause on our journey at this milestone and survey the dark, wide field. It is also useful to compare the first year of this second war against German aggression with its forerunner a quarter of a century ago. Although this war is in fact only a continuation of the last, very great differences in its character are apparent. In the last war millions of men fought by hurling enormous masses of steel at one another. \\\"Men and shells\\\" was the cry, and prodigious slaughter was the consequence. In this war nothing of this kind has yet appeared. It is a conflict of strategy, of organization, of technical apparatus, of science, mechanics and morale. The British casualties in the first 12 months of the Great War amounted to 365,000. In this war, I am thankful to say, British killed, wounded, prisoners and missing, including civilians, do not exceed 92,000, and of these a large proportion are alive as prisoners of war. Looking more widely around, one may say that throughout all Europe, for one man killed or wounded in the first year perhaps five were killed or wounded in 1914-15. The slaughter is only a small fraction, but the consequences to the belligerents have been even more deadly. We have seen great countries with powerful armies dashed out of coherent existence in a few weeks. We have seen the French Republic and the renowned French Army beaten into complete and total submission with less than the casualties which they suffered in any one of half a dozen of the battles of 1914-18. The entire body — it might almost seem at times the soul — of France has succumbed to physical effects incomparably less terrible than those which were sustained with fortitude and undaunted will power 25 years ago. Although up to the present the loss of life has been mercifully diminished, the decisions reached in the course of the struggle are even more profound upon the fate of nations than anything that has ever happened since barbaric times. Moves are made upon the scientific and strategic boards, advantages are gained by mechanical means, as a result of which scores of millions of men become incapable of further resistance, or judge themselves incapable of further resistance, and a fearful game of chess proceeds from check to mate by which the unhappy players seem to be inexorably bound. There is another more obvious difference from 1914. The whole of the warring nations are engaged, not only soldiers, but the entire population, men, women and children. The fronts are everywhere. The trenches are dug in the towns and streets. Every village is fortified. Every road is barred. The front line runs through the factories. The workmen are soldiers with different weapons but the same courage. These are great and distinctive changes from what many of us saw in the struggle of a quarter of a century ago. There seems to be every reason to believe that this new kind of war is well suited to the genius and the resources of the British nation and the British Empire; and that, once we get properly equipped and properly started, a war of this kind will be more favorable to us than the sombre mass slaughters of the Somme and Passchendaele. If it is a case of the whole nation fighting and suffering together, that ought to suit us, because we are the most united of all the nations, because we entered the war upon the national will and with our eyes open, and because we have been nurtured in freedom and individual responsibility and are the products, not of totalitarian uniformity, but of tolerance and variety. If all these qualities are turned, as they are being turned, to the arts of war, we may be able to show the enemy quite a lot of things that they have not thought of yet. Since the Germans drove the Jews out and lowered their technical standards, our science is definitely ahead of theirs. Our geographical position, the command of the sea, and the friendship of the United States enable us to draw resources from the whole world and to manufacture weapons of war of every kind, but especially of the superfine kinds, on a scale hitherto practiced only by Nazi Germany. Hitler is now sprawled over Europe. Our offensive springs are being slowly compressed, and we must resolutely and methodically prepare ourselves for the campaigns of 1941 and 1942. Two or three years are not a long time, even in our short, precarious lives. They are nothing in the history of the nation, and when we are doing the finest thing in the world, and have the honor to be the sole champion of the liberties of all Europe, we must not grudge these years or weary as we toil and struggle through them. It does not follow that our energies in future years will be exclusively confined to defending ourselves and our possessions. Many opportunities may lie open to amphibious power, and we must be ready to take advantage of them. One of the ways to bring this war to a speedy end is to convince the enemy, not by words, but by deeds, that we have both the will and the means, not only to go on indefinitely, but to strike heavy and unexpected blows. The road to victory may not be so long as we expect. But we have no right to count upon this. Be it long or short, rough or smooth, we mean to reach our journey's end. It is our intention to maintain and enforce a strict blockade, not only of Germany, but of Italy, France, and all the other countries that have fallen into the German power. I read in the papers that Herr Hitler has also proclaimed a strict blockade of the British Islands. No one can complain of that. I remember the Kaiser doing it in the last war. What indeed would be a matter of general complaint would be if we were to prolong the agony of all Europe by allowing food to come in to nourish the Nazis and aid their war effort, or to allow food to go in to the subjugated peoples, which certainly would be pillaged off them by their Nazi conquerors. There have been many proposals, founded on the highest motives, that food should be allowed to pass the blockade for the relief of these populations. I regret that we must refuse these requests. The Nazis declare that they have created a new unified economy in Europe. They have repeatedly stated that they possess ample reserves of food and that they can feed their captive peoples. In a German broadcast of 27th June it was said that while Mr. Hoover's plan for relieving France, Belgium and Holland deserved commendation, the German forces had already taken the necessary steps. We know that in Norway when the German troops went in, there were food supplies to last for a year. We know that Poland, though not a rich country, usually produces sufficient food for her people. Moreover, the other countries which Herr Hitler has invaded all held considerable stocks when the Germans entered and are themselves, in many cases, very substantial food producers. If all this food is not available now, it can only be because it has been removed to feed the people of Germany and to give them increased rations — for a change — during the last few months. At this season of the year and for some months to come, there is the least chance of scarcity as the harvest has just been gathered in. The only agencies which can create famine in any part of Europe, now and during the coming winter, will be German exactions or German failure to distribute the supplies which they command. There is another aspect. Many of the most valuable foods are essential to the manufacture of vital war material. Fats are used to make explosives. Potatoes make the alcohol for motor spirit. The plastic materials now so largely used in the construction of aircraft are made of milk. If the Germans use these commodities to help them to bomb our women and children, rather than to feed the populations who produce them, we may be sure that imported foods would go the same way, directly or indirectly, or be employed to relieve the enemy of the responsibilities he has so wantonly assumed. Let Hitler bear his responsibilities to the full, and let the peoples of Europe who groan beneath his yoke aid in every way the coming of the day when that yoke will be broken. Meanwhile, we can and we will arrange in advance for the speedy entry of food into any part of the enslaved area, when this part has been wholly cleared of German forces, and has genuinely regained its freedom. We shall do our best to encourage the building up of reserves of food all over the world, so that there will always be held up before the eyes of the peoples of Europe, including — I say deliberately — the German and Austrian peoples, the certainty that the shattering of the Nazi power will bring to them all immediate food, freedom and peace. Rather more than a quarter of a year has passed since the new Government came into power in this country. What a cataract of disaster has poured out upon us since then! The trustful Dutch overwhelmed; their beloved and respected Sovereign driven into exile; the peaceful city of Rotterdam the scene of a massacre as hideous and brutal as anything in the Thirty Years' War; Belgium invaded and beaten down; our own fine Expeditionary Force, which King Leopold called to his rescue, cut off and almost captured, escaping as it seemed only by a miracle and with the loss of all its equipment; our Ally, France, out; Italy in against us; all France in the power of the enemy, all its arsenals and vast masses of military material converted or convertible to the enemy's use; a puppet Government set up at Vichy which may at any moment be forced to become our foe; the whole western seaboard of Europe from the North Cape to the Spanish frontier in German hands; all the ports, all the airfields on this immense front employed against us as potential springboards of invasion. Moreover, the German air power, numerically so far outstripping ours, has been brought so close to our Island that what we used to dread greatly has come to pass and the hostile bombers not only reach our shores in a few minutes and from many directions, but can be escorted by their fighting aircraft. Why, Sir, if we had been confronted at the beginning of May with such a prospect, it would have seemed incredible that at the end of a period of horror and disaster, or at this point in a period of horror and disaster, we should stand erect, sure of ourselves, masters of our fate and with the conviction of final victory burning unquenchable in our hearts. Few would have believed we could survive; none would have believed that we should today not only feel stronger but should actually be stronger than we have ever been before. Let us see what has happened on the other side of the scales. The British nation and the British Empire, finding themselves alone, stood undismayed against disaster. No one flinched or wavered; nay, some who formerly thought of peace, now think only of war. Our people are united and resolved, as they have never been before. Death and ruin have become small things compared with the shame of defeat or failure in duty. We cannot tell what lies ahead. It may be that even greater ordeals lie before us. We shall face whatever is coming to us. We are sure of ourselves and of our cause, and that is the supreme fact which has emerged in these months of trial. Meanwhile, we have not only fortified our hearts but our Island. We have rearmed and rebuilt our armies in a degree which would have been deemed impossible a few months ago. We have ferried across the Atlantic, in the month of July, thanks to our friends over there, an immense mass of munitions of all kinds: cannon, rifles, machine guns, cartridges and shell, all safely landed without the loss of a gun or a round. The output of our own factories, working as they have never worked before, has poured forth to the troops. The whole British Army is at home. More than 2,000,000 determined men have rifles and bayonets in their hands tonight, and three-quarters of them are in regular military formations. We have never had armies like this in our Island in time of war. The whole Island bristles against invaders, from the sea or from the air. As I explained to the House in the middle of June, the stronger our Army at home, the larger must the invading expedition be, and the larger the invading expedition, the less difficult will be the task of the Navy in detecting its assembly and in intercepting and destroying it in passage; and the greater also would be the difficulty of feeding and supplying the invaders if ever they landed, in the teeth of continuous naval and air attack on their communications. All this is classical and venerable doctrine. As in Nelson's day, the maxim holds, \\\"Our first line of defense is the enemy's ports.\\\" Now air reconnaissance and photography have brought to an old principle a new and potent aid. Our Navy is far stronger than it was at the beginning of the war. The great flow of new construction set on foot at the outbreak is now beginning to come in. We hope our friends across the ocean will send us a timely reinforcement to bridge the gap between the peace flotillas of 1939 and the war flotillas of 1941. There is no difficulty in sending such aid. The seas and oceans are open. The U-boats are contained. The magnetic mine is, up to the present time, effectively mastered. The merchant tonnage under the British flag, after a year of unlimited U-boat war, after eight months of intensive mining attack, is larger than when we began. We have, in addition, under our control at least 4,000,000 tons of shipping from the captive countries which has taken refuge here or in the harbors of the Empire. Our stocks of food of all kinds are far more abundant than in the days of peace, and a large and growing programme of food production is on foot. Why do I say all this? Not, assuredly, to boast; not, assuredly, to give the slightest countenance to complacency. The dangers we face are still enormous, but so are our advantages and resources. I recount them because the people have a right to know that there are solid grounds for the confidence which we feel, and that we have good reason to believe ourselves capable, as I said in a very dark hour two months ago, of continuing the war \\\"if necessary alone, if necessary for years.\\\" I say it also because the fact that the British Empire stands invincible, and that Nazidom is still being resisted, will kindle again the spark of hope in the breasts of hundreds of millions of down-trodden or despairing men and women throughout Europe, and far beyond its bounds, and that from these sparks there will presently come cleansing and devouring flame. The great air battle which has been in progress over this Island for the last few weeks has recently attained a high intensity. It is too soon to attempt to assign limits either to its scale or to its duration. We must certainly expect that greater efforts will be made by the enemy than any he has so far put forth. Hostile air fields are still being developed in France and the Low Countries, and the movement of squadrons and material for attacking us is still proceeding. It is quite plain that Herr Hitler could not admit defeat in his air attack on Great Britain without sustaining most serious injury. If after all his boastings and bloodcurdling threats and lurid accounts trumpeted round the world of the damage he has inflicted, of the vast numbers of our Air Force he has shot down, so he says, with so little loss to himself; if after tales of the panic-stricken British crushed in their holes cursing the plutocratic Parliament which has led them to such a plight — if after all this his whole air onslaught were forced after a while tamely to peter out, the Fuhrer's reputation for veracity of statement might be seriously impugned. We may be sure, therefore, that he will continue as long as he has the strength to do so, and as long as any preoccupations he may have in respect of the Russian Air Force allow him to do so. On the other hand, the conditions and course of the fighting have so far been favorable to us. I told the House two months ago that, whereas in France our fighter aircraft were wont to inflict a loss of two or three to one upon the Germans, and in the fighting at Dunkirk, which was a kind of no-man's-land, a loss of about three or four to one, we expected that in an attack on this Island we should achieve a larger ratio. This has certainly come true. It must also be remembered that all the enemy machines and pilots which are shot down over our Island, or over the seas which surround it, are either destroyed or captured; whereas a considerable proportion of our machines, and also of our pilots, are saved, and soon again in many cases come into action. A vast and admirable system of salvage, directed by the Ministry of Aircraft Production, ensures the speediest return to the fighting line of damaged machines, and the most provident and speedy use of all the spare parts and material. At the same time the splendid — nay, astounding — increase in the output and repair of British aircraft and engines which Lord Beaverbrook has achieved by a genius of organization and drive, which looks like magic, has given us overflowing reserves of every type of aircraft, and an ever-mounting stream of production both in quantity and quality. The enemy is, of course, far more numerous than we are. But our new production already, as I am advised, largely exceeds his, and the American production is only just beginning to flow in. It is a fact, as I see from my daily returns, that our bomber and fighter strength now, after all this fighting, are larger than they have ever been. We believe that we shall be able to continue the air struggle indefinitely and as long as the enemy pleases, and the longer it continues the more rapid will be our approach, first towards that parity, and then into that superiority, in the air upon which in a large measure the decision of the war depends. The gratitude of every home in our Island, in our Empire, and indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of the World War by their prowess and by their devotion. Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. All hearts go out to the fighter pilots, whose brilliant actions we see with our own eyes day after day; but we must never forget that all the time, night after night, month after month, our bomber squadrons travel far into Germany, find their targets in the darkness by the highest navigational skill, aim their attacks, often under the heaviest fire, often with serious loss, with deliberate careful discrimination, and inflict shattering blows upon the whole of the technical and war-making structure of the Nazi power. On no part of the Royal Air Force does the weight of the war fall more heavily than on the daylight bombers, who will play an invaluable part in the case of invasion and whose unflinching zeal it has been necessary in the meanwhile on numerous occasions to restrain. We are able to verify the results of bombing military targets in Germany, not only by reports which reach us through many sources, but also, of course, by photography. I have no hesitation in saying that this process of bombing the military industries and communications of Germany and the air bases and storage depots from which we are attacked, which process will continue upon an ever-increasing scale until the end of the war, and may in another year attain dimensions hitherto undreamed of, affords one at least of the most certain, if not the shortest, of all the roads to victory. Even if the Nazi legions stood triumphant on the Black Sea, or indeed upon the Caspian, even if Hitler was at the gates of India, it would profit him nothing if at the same time the entire economic and scientific apparatus of German war power lay shattered and pulverized at home. The fact that the invasion of this Island upon a large scale has become a far more difficult operation with every week that has passed since we saved our Army at Dunkirk, and our very great preponderance of sea power enable us to turn our eyes and to turn our strength increasingly towards the Mediterranean and against that other enemy who, without the slightest provocation, coldly and deliberately, for greed and gain, stabbed France in the back in the moment of her agony, and is now marching against us in Africa. The defection of France has, of course, been deeply damaging to our position in what is called, somewhat oddly, the Middle East. In the defense of Somaliland, for instance, we had counted upon strong French forces attacking the Italians from Jibuti. We had counted also upon the use of the French naval and air bases in the Mediterranean, and particularly upon the North African shore. We had counted upon the French Fleet. Even though metropolitan France was temporarily overrun, there was no reason why the French Navy, substantial parts of the French Army, the French Air Force and the French Empire overseas should not have continued the struggle at our side. Shielded by overwhelming sea power, possessed of invaluable strategic bases and of ample funds, France might have remained one of the great combatants in the struggle. By so doing, France would have preserved the continuity of her life, and the French Empire might have advanced with the British Empire to the rescue of the independence and integrity of the French Motherland. In our own case, if we had been put in the terrible position of France, a contingency now happily impossible, although, of course, it would have been the duty of all war leaders to fight on here to the end, it would also have been their duty, as I indicated in my speech of 4th June, to provide as far as possible for the Naval security of Canada and our Dominions and to make sure they had the means to carry on the struggle from beyond the oceans. Most of the other countries that have been overrun by Germany for the time being have persevered valiantly and faithfully. The Czechs, the Poles, the Norwegians, the Dutch, the Belgians are still in the field, sword in hand, recognized by Great Britain and the United States as the sole representative authorities and lawful Governments of their respective States. That France alone should lie prostrate at this moment is the crime, not of a great and noble nation, but of what are called \\\"the men of Vichy.\\\" We have profound sympathy with the French people. Our old comradeship with France is not dead. In General de Gaulle and his gallant band, that comradeship takes an effective form. These free Frenchmen have been condemned to death by Vichy, but the day will come, as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow, when their names will be held in honour, and their names will be graven in stone in the streets and villages of a France restored in a liberated Europe to its full freedom and its ancient fame. But this conviction which I feel of the future cannot affect the immediate problems which confront us in the Mediterranean and in Africa. It had been decided some time before the beginning of the war not to defend the Protectorate of Somaliland. That policy was changed in the early months of the war. When the French gave in, and when our small forces there, a few battalions, a few guns, were attacked by all the Italian troops, nearly two divisions, which had formerly faced the French at Jibuti, it was right to withdraw our detachments, virtually intact, for action elsewhere. Far larger operations no doubt impend in the Middle East theatre, and I shall certainly not attempt to discuss or prophesy about their probable course. We have large armies and many means of reinforcing them. We have the complete sea command of the eastern Mediterranean. We intend to do our best to give a good account of ourselves, and to discharge faithfully and resolutely all our obligations and duties in that quarter of the world. More than that I do not think the House would wish me to say at the present time. A good many people have written to me to ask me to make on this occasion a fuller statement of our war aims, and of the kind of peace we wish to make after the war, than is contained in the very considerable declaration which was made early in the autumn. Since then we have made common cause with Norway, Holland and Belgium. We have recognized the Czech Government of Dr. Benes, and we have told General de Gaulle that our success will carry with it the restoration of France. I do not think it would be wise at this moment, while the battle rages and the war is still perhaps only in its earlier stage, to embark upon elaborate speculations about the future shape which should be given to Europe or the new securities which must be arranged to spare mankind the miseries of a third World War. The ground is not new, it has been frequently traversed and explored, and many ideas are held about it in common by all good men, and all free men. But before we can undertake the task of rebuilding we have not only to be convinced ourselves, but we have to convince all other countries that the Nazi tyranny is going to be finally broken. The right to guide the course of world history is the noblest prize of victory. We are still toiling up the hill; we have not yet reached the crest-line of it; we cannot survey the landscape or even imagine what its condition will be when that longed-for morning comes. The task which lies before us immediately is at once more practical, more simple and more stern. I hope — indeed, I pray — that we shall not be found unworthy of our victory if after toil and tribulation it is granted to us. For the rest, we have to gain the victory. That is our task. There is, however, one direction in which we can see a little more clearly ahead. We have to think not only for ourselves but for the lasting security of the cause and principles for which we are fighting and of the long future of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Some months ago we came to the conclusion that the interests of the United States and of the British Empire both required that the United States should have facilities for the naval and air defence of the Western Hemisphere against the attack of a Nazi power which might have acquired temporary but lengthy control of a large part of Western Europe and its formidable resources. We had therefore decided spontaneously, and without being asked or offered any inducement, to inform the Government of the United States that we would be glad to place such defense facilities at their disposal by leasing suitable sites in our Transatlantic possessions for their greater security against the unmeasured dangers of the future. The principle of association of interests for common purposes between Great Britain and the United States had developed even before the war. Various agreements had been reached about certain small islands in the Pacific Ocean which had become important as air fueling points. In all this line of thought we found ourselves in very close harmony with the Government of Canada. Presently we learned that anxiety was also felt in the United States about the air and naval defense of their Atlantic seaboard, and President Roosevelt has recently made it clear that he would like to discuss with us, and with the Dominion of Canada and with Newfoundland, the development of American naval and air facilities in Newfoundland and in the West Indies. There is, of course, no question of any transference of sovereignty — that has never been suggested — or of any action being taken without the consent or against the wishes of the various Colonies concerned; but for our part, His Majesty's Government are entirely willing to accord defense facilities to the United States on a 99 years' leasehold basis, and we feel sure that our interests no less than theirs, and the interests of the Colonies themselves and of Canada and Newfoundland, will be served thereby. These are important steps. Undoubtedly this process means that these two great organizations of the English-speaking democracies, the British Empire and the United States, will have to be somewhat mixed up together in some of their affairs for mutual and general advantage. For my own part, looking out upon the future, I do not view the process with any misgivings. I could not stop it if I wished; no one can stop it. Like the Mississippi, it just keeps rolling along. Let it roll. Let it roll on full flood, inexorable, irresistible, benignant, to broader lands and better days.\"\n",

It is with that obligation in mind that I have decided in the last 24 hours to discuss briefly at this time the recent events in Cuba.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn that unhappy island, as in so many other arenas of the contest for freedom, the news has grown worse instead of better. I have emphasized before that this was a struggle of Cuban patriots against a Cuban dictator. While we could not be expected to hide our sympathies, we made it repeatedly clear that the armed forces of this country would not intervene in any way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny unilateral American intervention, in the absence of an external attack upon ourselves or an ally, would have been contrary to our traditions and to our international obligations. But let the record show that our restraint is not inexhaustible. Should it ever appear that the inter-American doctrine of non-interference merely conceals or excuses a policy of nonaction--if the nations of this Hemisphere should fail to meet their commitments against outside Communist penetration-then I want it clearly understood that this Government will not hesitate in meeting its primary obligations which are to the security of our Nation!\\r\\n\\r\\nShould that time ever come, we do not intend to be lectured on \\\"intervention\\\" by those whose character was stamped for all time on the bloody streets of Budapest! Nor would we expect or accept the same outcome which this small band of gallant Cuban refugees must have known that they were chancing, determined as they were against heavy odds to pursue their courageous attempts to regain their Island's freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Cuba is not an island unto itself; and our concern is not ended by mere expressions of nonintervention or regret. This is not the first time in either ancient or recent history that a small band of freedom fighters has engaged the armor of totalitarianism.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not the first time that Communist tanks have rolled over gallant men and women fighting to redeem the independence of their homeland. Nor is it by any means the final episode in the eternal struggle of liberty against tyranny, anywhere on the face of the globe, including Cuba itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Castro has said that these were mercenaries. According to press reports, the final message to be relayed from the refugee forces on the beach came from the rebel commander when asked if he wished to be evacuated. His answer was: \\\"I will never leave this country.\\\" That is not the reply of a mercenary. He has gone now to join in the mountains countless other guerrilla fighters, who are equally determined that the dedication of those who gave their lives shall not be forgotten, and that Cuba must not be abandoned to the Communists. And we do not intend to abandon it either!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cuban people have not yet spoken their final piece. And I have no doubt that they and their Revolutionary Council, led by Dr. Cardona--and members of the families of the Revolutionary Council, I am informed by the Doctor yesterday, are involved themselves in the Islands--will continue to speak up for a free and independent Cuba.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile we will not accept Mr. Castro's attempts to blame this nation for the hatred which his onetime supporters now regard his repression. But there are from this sobering episode useful lessons for us all to learn. Some may be still obscure, and await further information. Some are clear today.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, it is clear that the forces of communism are not to be underestimated, in Cuba or anywhere else in the world. The advantages of a police state--its use of mass terror and arrests to prevent the spread of free dissent--cannot be overlooked by those who expect the fall of every fanatic tyrant. If the self-discipline of the free cannot match the iron discipline of the mailed fist--in economic, political, scientific and all the other kinds of struggles as well as the military--then the peril to freedom will continue to rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, it is clear that this Nation, in concert with all the free nations of this hemisphere, must take an ever closer and more realistic look at the menace of external Communist intervention and domination in Cuba. The American people are not complacent about Iron Curtain tanks and planes less than 90 miles from their shore. But a nation of Cuba's size is less a threat to our survival than it is a base for subverting the survival of other free nations throughout the hemisphere. It is not primarily our interest or our security but theirs which is now, today, in the greater peril. It is for their sake as well as our own that we must show our will.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evidence is clear--and the hour is late. We and our Latin friends will have to face the fact that we cannot postpone any longer the real issue of survival of freedom in this hemisphere itself. On that issue, unlike perhaps some others, there can be no middle ground. Together we must build a hemisphere where freedom can flourish; and where any free nation under outside attack of any kind can be assured that all of our resources stand ready to respond to any request for assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, and finally, it is clearer than ever that we face a relentless struggle in every corner of the globe that goes far beyond the clash of armies or even nuclear armaments. The armies are there, and in large number. The nuclear armaments are there. But they serve primarily as the shield behind which subversion, infiltration, and a host of other tactics steadily advance, picking off vulnerable areas one by one in situations which do not permit our own armed intervention.\\r\\n\\r\\nPower is the hallmark of this offensive-power and discipline and deceit. The legitimate discontent of yearning people is exploited. The legitimate trappings of self-determination are employed. But once in power, all talk of discontent is repressed, all self-determination disappears, and the promise of a revolution of hope is betrayed, as in Cuba, into a reign of terror. Those who on instruction staged automatic \\\"riots\\\" in the streets of free nations over the efforts of a small group of young Cubans to regain their freedom should recall the long roll call of refugees who cannot now go back--to Hungary, to North Korea, to North Viet-Nam, to East Germany, or to Poland, or to any of the other lands from which a steady stream of refugees pours forth, in eloquent testimony to the cruel oppression now holding sway in their homeland.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe dare not fail to see the insidious nature of this new and deeper struggle. We dare not fail to grasp the new concepts, the new tools, the new sense of urgency we will need to combat it--whether in Cuba or South Viet-Nam. And we dare not fail to realize that this struggle is taking place every day, without fanfare, in thousands of villages and markets--day and night--and in classrooms all over the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe message of Cuba, of Laos, of the rising din of Communist voices in Asia and Latin America--these messages are all the same. The complacent, the self-indulgent the soft societies are about to be swept away with the debris of history. Only the strong, only the industrious, only the determined, only the courageous, only the visionary who determine the real nature of our struggle can possibly survive.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo greater task faces this country or this administration. No other challenge is more deserving of our every effort and energy. Too long we have fixed our eyes on traditional military needs, on armies prepared to cross borders, on missiles poised for flight. Now it should be clear that this is no longer enough--that our security may be lost piece by piece, country by country, without the firing of a single missile or the crossing of a single border.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe intend to profit from this lesson. We intend to reexamine and reorient our forces of all kinds--our tactics and our institutions here in this community. We intend to intensify our efforts for a struggle in many ways more difficult than war, where disappointment will often accompany us.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor I am convinced that we in this country and in the free world possess the necessary resource, and the skill, and the added strength that comes from a belief in the freedom of man. And I am equally convinced that history will record the fact that this bitter struggle reached its climax in the late 1950's and the early 1960's. Let me then make clear as the President of the United States that I am determined upon our system's survival and success, regardless of the cost and regardless of the peril!\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F.

It must promote economic stability and stimulate economic growth. Economic expansion in turn creates a growing tax base, thus increasing revenue and thereby enabling us to meet more readily our public needs, as well as our needs as private individuals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis message recognizes the basic soundness of our tax structure. But it also recognizes the changing needs and standards of our economic and international position, and the constructive reform needs to keep our tax system up to date and to maintain its equity. Previous messages have emphasized the need for prompt Congressional and Executive action to alleviate the deficit in our international balance of payments--to increase the modernization, productivity and competitive status of American industry--to stimulate the expansion and growth of our economy--to eliminate to the extent possible economic injustice within our own society--and to maintain the level of revenues requested in my predecessor's Budget. In each of these endeavors, tax policy has an important role to play and necessary tax changes are herein proposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elimination of certain defects and inequities as proposed below will provide revenue gains to offset the tax reductions offered to stimulate the economy. Thus no net loss of revenue is involved in this set of proposals. I wish to emphasize here that they are a \\\"set\\\"--and that considerations of both revenue and equity, as well as the interrelationship of many of the proposals, urge their consideration as a unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am instructing the Secretary of the Treasury to furnish the Committee on Ways and Means of the House a detailed explanation of these proposals in connection with their legislative consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nI. LONG-RANGE TAX REFORM\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it is essential that the Congress receive at this time this Administration's proposals for urgent and obvious tax adjustments needed to fulfill the aims listed above, time has not permitted the comprehensive review necessary for a tax structure which is so complicated and so critically important to so many people. This message is but a first though urgent step along the road to constructive reform.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am directing the Secretary of the Treasury, building on recent tax studies of the Congress, to undertake the research and preparation of a comprehensive tax reform program to be placed before the next session of the Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nProgressing from these studies, particularly those of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Joint Economic Committee, the program should be aimed at providing a broader and more uniform tax base, together with an appropriate rate structure. We can thereby work toward the goal of a higher rate of economic growth, a more equitable tax structure, and a simpler tax law. I know these objectives are shared by--and, at this particular time of year, acutely desired by--the vast majority of the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn meeting the demands of war finance, the individual income tax moved from a selective tax imposed on the wealthy to the means by which the great majority of our citizens participates in paying for well over one-half of our total budget receipts. It is supplemented by the corporation income tax, which provides for another quarter of the total.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis emphasis on income taxation has been a sound development. But so many taxpayers have become so preoccupied with so many tax-saving devices that business decisions are interfered with, and the efficient functioning of the price system is distorted.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, special provisions have developed into an increasing source of preferential treatment to various groups. Whenever one taxpayer is permitted to pay less, someone else must be asked to pay more. The uniform distribution of the tax burden is thereby disturbed and higher rates are made necessary by the narrowing of the tax base. Of course, some departures from uniformity are needed to promote desirable social or economic objectives of overriding importance which can be achieved most effectively through the tax mechanism. But many of the preferences which have developed do not meet such a test and need to be reevaluated in our tax reform program.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be a major aim of our tax reform program to reverse this process, by broadening the tax base and reconsidering the rate structure. The result should be a tax system that is more equitable, more efficient and more conducive to economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nII. TAX INCENTIVE FOR MODERNIZATION AND EXPANSION\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of our economy has been one of rising productivity, based on improvement in skills, advances in technology, and a growing supply of more efficient tools and equipment. This rise has been reflected in rising wages and standards of living for our workers, as well as a healthy rate of growth for the economy as a whole. It has also been the foundation of our leadership in world markets, even as we enjoyed the highest wage rates in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, as we face serious pressure on our balance of payments position, we must give special attention to the modernization of our plant and equipment. Forced to reconstruct after wartime devastation, our friends abroad now possess a modern industrial system helping to make them formidable competitors in world markets. If our own goods are to compete with foreign goods in price and quality, both at home and abroad, we shall need the most efficient plant and equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, to meet the needs of a growing population and labor force, and to achieve a rising per capita income and employment level, we need a high and rising level of both private and public capital formation. In my preceding messages, I have proposed programs to meet some of our needs for such capital formation in the public area, including investment in intangible capital such as education and research, as well as investment in physical capital such as buildings and highways. I am now proposing additional incentives for the modernization and expansion of private plant and equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nInevitably, capital expansion and modernization-now frequently under the name of automation--alter established modes of production. Great benefits result and are distributed widely--but some hardships result as well. This places heavy responsibilities on public policy, not to retard modernization and capital expansion but to promote growth and ameliorate hardships when they do occur--to maintain a high level of demand and employment, so that those who are displaced will be reabsorbed quickly into new positions--and to assist in retraining and finding new jobs for such displaced workers. We are developing, through such measures as the Area Redevelopment Bill and a strengthened Employment Service, as well as assistance to the unemployed, the programs designed to achieve these objectives.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh capital formation can be sustained only by a high and rising level of demand for goods and service. Indeed, the investment incentive itself can contribute materially to achieving the prosperous economy under which this incentive will make its maximum contribution to economic growth. Rather than delaying its adoption until all excess capacity has disappeared and unemployment is low, we should take this step now to strengthen our anti-recession program, stimulate employment and increase our export markets.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional expenditures on plant and equipment will immediately create more jobs in the construction, lumber, steel, cement, machinery and other related capital goods industries. The staffing of these new plants--and filling the orders for new export markets--will require additional employees. The additional wages of these workers will help create still more jobs in consumer goods and service industries. The increase in jobs resulting from a full year's operation of such an incentive is estimated at about half a million.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecifically, therefore, I recommend enactment of an investment tax incentive in the form of a tax credit of\\r\\n\\r\\n--15% of all new plant and equipment investment expenditures in excess of current depreciation allowances\\r\\n\\r\\n--6% of such expenditures below this level but in excess of 50% of depreciation allowances; with\\r\\n\\r\\n--10% on the first $5,000 of new investment as a minimum credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis credit would be taken as an offset against the firm's tax liability, up to an overall limitation of 30% in the reduction of that liability in any one year. It would be separate from and in addition to depreciation of the eligible new investment at cost. It would be available to individually owned businesses as well as corporate enterprises, and apply to eligible investment expenditures made after January 1 of this year. To remain a real incentive and make a maximum contribution to those areas of capital expansion and modernization where it is most needed, and to permit efficient administration, eligible investment expenditures would be limited to expenditures on new plant and equipment, on assets located in .the United States, and on assets with a life of six years or more. Investments by public utilities other than transportation would be excluded, as would be investment in residential construction including apartments and hotels.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the eligible firms, it is expected that many small firms would be able to take advantage of the minimum credit of 10% on the first $5000 of new investment which is designed to provide a helpful stimulus to the many small businesses in need of modernization. Other small firms, subject to a 30% tax rate, would strive to be eligible for the full 15% credit--the equivalent for such firms of a deduction from their gross income for tax purposes of 50% of the cost of new investment. Among the remaining firms, it is expected that a majority would be induced to make new investments in modern plant and equipment in excess of their depreciation in order to earn the 15% credit. New and growing firms would be particularly benefited. The 6% credit for those whose new investment expenditures fall between 50% and 100% of their depreciation allowances is designed to afford some substantial incentive to the depressed or hesitant firm which knows it cannot yet achieve the 15% credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn arriving at this form of tax encouragement to investment, careful consideration was given to other alternatives. If the credit were given across-the-board to all new investment, a much larger revenue loss would result from those expenditures which would have been undertaken anyway or represent no new level of effort. Our objective is to provide the largest possible inducement to new investment which would not otherwise be undertaken. Thus the plan recommended above would involve the same revenue loss--approximately $1.7 billion--as only a 7 percent credit across-the-board to all new investment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of current depreciation allowances as the threshold above which the higher rate of credit would apply recommends itself for a number of reasons. Depreciation reflects the average level of investment over the past, but is a less restrictive and more stable test than the use of an average of investment expenditures for a period such as the preceding five years. In addition, the depreciation allowances themselves in effect supply tax-free funds for investment up to this level. We now propose a tax credit-which would help to secure funds needed for the additional investment beyond that level.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposed credit, in terms of the revenue loss involved, will also be much more effective as an inducement to investment than an outright reduction in the rate of corporation income tax. Its benefits would be distributed more broadly, since the proposed credit will apply to individuals and partnerships as well as corporations. It will also be more effective as a direct incentive to corporate investment, and increase available funds more specifically in those corporations most likely to use them for additional investment. In short, whereas the credit will have the advantage of focusing on the profitability of new investment, much of the revenue loss under a general corporate rate reduction would be diverted into raising the profitability of old investment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true that this advantage of focusing entirely on new investment is shared by the alternative strongly urged by some--a tax change permitting more rapid depreciation of new assets (be it accelerated depreciation or an additional depreciation allowance for the first year). But the proposed investment credit would be superior, in my view, for a number of reasons. In the first place, the determination of the length of an asset's life and proper methods of depreciation have a normal and important function in determining taxable income, wholly apart from any considerations of incentive; and they should not be altered or manipulated for other purposes that would interfere with this function. It may be that on examination some of the existing depreciation rules will be found to be outmoded and inequitable; but that is a question that should be separated from investment incentives. A review of these rules and methods is underway in the Treasury Department as a part of its overall tax reform study to determine whether changes are appropriate and, if so, what form they should take. Adoption of the proposed incentive credit would in no way foreclose later action on these aspects of depreciation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second place, an increase in tax depreciation tends to be recorded in the firm's accounts, thereby raising current costs and acting as a deterrent to price reduction. The proposed investment credit would not share this defect.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, it is clear that the tax credit would be more effective in inducing new investment for the same revenue loss. The entire credit would be reflected immediately in the increased funds available for investment without increasing the company's future tax liability. A speed-up in depreciation only postpones the timing of the tax liability on profits from the investment to a later date--an increase in profitability not comparable to that of an outright tax credit. Yet accelerated depreciation is much more costly in immediate revenues.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, on an average investment, a tax credit of 15% would bring the same return to the firm as an additional first year depreciation of over 50% of the cost of the investment. Yet the immediate revenue loss to the Treasury from such additional depreciation would be twice as much, and would remain considerably higher for many years. The incentive to new investment our economy needs, and which this recommendation would provide at a revenue loss of $ 1.7 billion, could be supplied by an initial write-off only at an immediate cost of $3.4 billion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe this investment tax credit will become a useful and continuous part of our tax structure. But it will be a new venture and remain in need of review. Moreover, it may prove desirable for the Congress to modify the credit from time to time, so as to adapt it to the needs of a changing economy. I strongly urge its adoption in this session.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII. TAX TREATMENT OF FOREIGN INCOME\\r\\n\\r\\nChanging economic conditions at home and abroad, the desire to achieve greater equity in taxation, and the strains which have developed in our balance of payments position in the last few years, compel us to examine critically certain features of our tax system which, in conjunction with the tax system of other countries, consistently favor United States private investment abroad compared with investment in our own economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Elimination of tax deferral privileges in developed countries and \\\"tax haven\\\" deferral privileges in all countries. Profits earned abroad by American firms operating through foreign subsidiaries are, under present tax laws, subject to United States tax only when they are returned to the parent company in the form of dividends. In some cases, this tax deferral has made possible indefinite postponement of the United States tax; and, in those countries where income taxes are lower than in the United States, the ability to defer the payment of U.S. tax by retaining income in the subsidiary companies provides a tax advantage for companies operating through overseas subsidiaries that is not available to companies operating solely in the United States. Many American investors properly made use of this deferral in the conduct of their foreign investment. Though changing conditions now make continuance of the privilege undesirable, such change of policy implies no criticism of the investors who so utilize this privilege.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe undesirability of continuing deferral is underscored where deferral has served as a shelter for tax escape through the unjustifiable use of tax havens such as Switzerland. Recently more and more enterprises organized abroad by American firms have arranged their corporate structures--aided by artificial arrangements between parent and subsidiary regarding intercompany pricing, the transfer of patent licensing rights, the shifting of management fees, and similar practices which maximize the accumulation of profits in the tax haven--so as to exploit the multiplicity of foreign tax systems and international agreements in order to reduce sharply or eliminate completely their tax liabilities both at home and abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the extent that these tax havens and other tax deferral privileges result in U.S. firms investing or locating abroad largely for tax reasons, the efficient allocation of international resources is upset, the initial drain on our already adverse balance of payments is never fully compensated, and profits are retained and reinvested abroad which would otherwise be invested in the United States. Certainly since the postwar reconstruction of Europe and Japan has been completed, there are no longer foreign policy reasons for providing tax incentives for foreign investment in the economically advanced countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we are seeking to curb tax havens, if we recognize that the stimulus of tax deferral is no longer needed for investment in the developed countries, and if we are to emphasize investment in this country in order to stimulate our economy and our plant modernization, as well as ease our balance of payments deficit, we can no longer afford existing tax treatment of foreign income.\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore recommend that legislation be adopted which would, after a two-step transitional period, tax each year American corporations on their current share of the undistributed profits realized in that year by subsidiary corporations organized in economically advanced countries. This current taxation would also apply to individual shareholders of closely-held corporations in those countries. Since income taxes paid abroad are properly a credit against the United States income tax, this would subject the income from such business activities to essentially the same tax rates as business activities conducted in the United States. To permit firms to adjust their operations to this change, I also recommend that this result be achieved in equal steps over a two-year period, under which only one-half of the profits would be affected during 1962. Where the foreign taxes paid have been close to the U.S. rates, the impact of this change would be small.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis proposal will maintain United States investment in the developed countries at the level justified by market forces. American enterprise abroad will continue to compete with foreign firms. With their access to capital markets at home and abroad, their advanced technical know-how, their energy, resourcefulness and many other advantages, American firms will continue to occupy their rightful place in the markets of the world. While the rate of expansion of some American business operations abroad may be reduced through the withdrawal of tax deferral such reduction would be consistent with the efficient distribution of capital resources in the world, our balance of payments needs, and fairness to competing firms located in our own country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, I recommend that tax deferral be continued for income from investment in the developing economies. The free world has a strong obligation to assist in the development of these economies, and private investment has an important contribution to make. Continued income tax deferral for these areas will be helpful in this respect. In addition, the proposed elimination of income tax deferral on United States earnings in industrialized countries should enhance the relative attraction of investment in the less developed countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, I recommend elimination of the \\\"tax haven\\\" device anywhere in the world, even in the underdeveloped countries, through the elimination of tax deferral privileges for those forms of activities, such as trading, licensing, insurance and others, that typically seek out tax haven methods of operation. There is no valid reason to permit their remaining untaxed regardless of the country in which they are located.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Taxation of Foreign Investment Companies. For some years now we have witnessed substantial outflows of capital from the United States into investment companies created abroad whose principal justification lies in the tax benefits which their method of operation produces. I recommend that these tax benefits be removed and that income derived through such foreign investment companies be treated in substantially the same way as income from domestic investment companies.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Taxation of American Citizens Abroad. It is no more justifiable to provide tax exemptions for individuals living in the developed countries than it is to provide tax inducements for capital investment there. Nor should we permit totally unjustified tax benefits to be obtained by those Americans whose choice of residence is dictated primarily by their desire to minimize taxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, therefore, recommend:\\r\\n\\r\\n--that the total tax exemption now accorded the earned income of American citizens residing abroad be completely terminated for those residing in economically advanced countries;\\r\\n\\r\\n--that this exemption for earned income be limited to $20,000 for those residing in the less developed countries; and\\r\\n\\r\\n--that the exemption of $20,000 of earned income now accorded those citizens who stay (but do not reside) abroad for 17 out of 18 months also be completely terminated for those living or traveling in the economically advanced countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Estate Tax on Property Located Abroad. I recommend that the exclusion from the estate tax accorded real property situated abroad be terminated. With the adoption several years ago of the credit for foreign taxes under the estate tax, there is no justification for the continued exemption of such property.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Allowance for Foreign Tax on Dividends. Finally, the method by which the credit for foreign income taxes is computed in the case of dividends involves a double allowance for foreign income taxes and should be corrected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese proposals, along with more detailed and technical changes needed to improve the taxation of foreign income, are expected to reduce substantially our balance of payments deficit and to increase revenues by at least $250 million per year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIV. CORRECTION OF OTHER STRUCTURAL DEFECTS\\r\\n\\r\\nI next recommend a number of measures to remove other serious defects in the income tax structure. These changes, while making a beginning toward the comprehensive tax reform program mentioned above, will provide sufficient revenue gains to offset the cost of the investment tax credit and keep the revenue-producing potential of our tax structure intact.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Withholding on Interest and Dividends. Our system of combined withholding and voluntary reporting on wages and salaries under the individual income tax has served us well. Introduced during the war when the income tax was extended to millions of new taxpayers, the wage-withholding system has been one of the most important and successful advances in our tax system in recent times. Initial difficulties were quickly overcome, and the new system helped the taxpayer no less than the tax collector.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the more unfortunate, therefore, that the application of the withholding principle has remained incomplete. Withholding does not apply to dividends and interest, with the result that substantial amounts of such income, particularly interest, improperly escape taxation. It is estimated that about $3 billion of taxable interest and dividends are unreported each year. This is patently unfair to those who must as a result bear a larger share of the tax burden. Re-cipients of dividends and interest should pay their tax no less than those who receive wage and salary income, and the tax should be paid just as promptly. Large continued avoidance of tax on the part of some has a steadily demoralizing effect on the compliance of others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis gap in reporting has not been appreciably lessened by educational programs. Nor can it be effectively closed by intensified enforcement measures, except by the expenditure of inordinate amounts of time and money. Withholding on corporate dividends and on investment type interest, such as interest paid on taxable government and corporate securities and savings accounts, is both necessary and practicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, therefore, recommend the enactment of legislation to provide for a 20% withholding rate on corporate dividends and taxable investment type interest, effective January 1, 1962, under a system which would not require the preparation of withholding statements to be sent to recipients. It would thus place a relatively light burden of compliance on the payers of interest and dividends--certainly less than that placed on payers of wages and salaries--while at the same time largely solving the compliance problem for most of the taxpayers receiving dividends and interest. Steps will also be taken to avoid hardships for recipients who are not subject to tax.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remaining need for compliance, largely in the high income group subject to a higher tax rate, would be met through the concentration of enforcement devices on taxpayers in these brackets. Introduction of equipment for the automatic processing of information returns would be especially helpful for this purpose and would thus supplement the extension of withholding.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnactment of this proposal is estimated to increase revenue by $600 million per year.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Repeal of the Dividend Credit and Exclusion. The present law provides for an exclusion from income of the first $50 of dividends received from domestic corporations and for a 4% credit against tax of such dividend income in excess of $50. These provisions were enacted in 1954. Proponents argued that they would encourage capital formation through equity investment, and that they would provide a partial offset to the so-called double taxation of dividend income. It is now clear that they serve neither purpose well; and I, therefore, recommend the repeal of both the dividend credit and exclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dividend credit and exclusion are not an efficient stimulus to capital expansion in the form of plant and equipment. The revenue losses resulting from these provisions are spread over a large volume of outstanding shares rather than being concentrated on new shares; and the stimulating effects of the provisions are thus greatly diluted, resulting in relatively little increases in the supply of equity funds and a relatively slight reduction in the cost of equity financing. In fact, such reduction as does occur is more likely to benefit large corporations with easy access to the capital market, while being of little use to small firms which are not so favorably situated. Insofar as raising the profitability of new investment in plant and equipment is concerned, the tax investment credit proposed above would be far more effective since it is offered to the corporation, where the actual investment decision is made.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dividend credit and exclusion are equally inadequate as a solution to the so-called problem of double taxation. Whatever may be the merits of the arguments respecting the existence of double taxation, the provisions of the 1954 Act clearly do not offer an appropriate remedy. They greatly overcompensate the dividend recipient in the high income bracket, while giving either insufficient or no relief to shareholders with smaller income.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis point deserves emphasis. For viewed simply as a means of tax reduction, the dividend credit is. wholly inequitable. The distribution of its benefits is highly favorable to the taxpayers in the upper income groups who receive the major part of dividend income. Only about 10 percent of dividend income accrues to those with incomes below $5,000; about 80 percent of it accrues to that 6.5% of taxpayers whose incomes exceed $10,000 a year. Similarly, dividend income is a sharply rising fraction of total income as we move up the income scale. Thus, dividend income is about 1 percent of all income from all sources for those taxpayers with incomes of $3,000 to $5,000; but it constitutes more than 25 percent of the income for those with $100,000 to $150,000 of income, and about 50 percent for those with incomes over $1,000,000,\\r\\n\\r\\nThe role of the dividend credit should not be confused with the broader question of tax rates applicable to high incomes. These high rates deserve re-examination; and this is one of the problems which will be examined in the context of next year's tax reform. But if top bracket rates were to be reduced, the dividend credit is not the way to do it. Rate reductions, if appropriate, should apply no less to those with high incomes from other sources, such as professional and salaried people whose tax position is particularly difficult today.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the credit is eliminated, the $50 exclusion should also be discarded for similar reasons. The tax saving from the exclusion is substantially greater for a dividend recipient with a high income than for a recipient with low income. Moreover, on equity grounds, there is no reason for giving tax reduction to that small fraction of low income tax payers who receive dividends in contrast to those who must live on wages, interest, rents or other forms of income.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1954 formula therefore is a dead-end and should be rescinded, effective December 31 of this year. The estimated revenue gain is $450 million per year.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Expense Accounts. In recent years widespread abuses have developed through the use of the expense account. Too many firms and individuals have devised means of deducting too many personal living expenses as business expenses, thereby charging a large part of their cost to the Federal Government. Indeed, expense account living has become a byword in the American scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a matter of national concern, affecting not only our public revenues, our sense of fairness, and our respect for the tax system, but our moral and business practices as well. This widespread distortion of our business and social structure is largely a creature of the tax system, and the time has come when our tax laws should cease their encouragement of luxury spending as a charge on the Federal treasury. The slogan--\\\"It's deductible\\\"--should pass from our scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nTighter enforcement of present legislation will not suffice. Even though in some instances entertainment and related expenses have an association with the needs of business, they nevertheless confer substantial tax-free personal benefits to the recipients. In other cases, deductions are obtained by disguising personal expenses as business outlays. But under present law, it is extremely difficult to separate out and disallow such pseudo-business expenditures. New legislation is needed to deal with the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, therefore, recommend that the cost of such business entertainment and the maintenance of entertainment facilities (such as yachts and hunting lodges) be disallowed in full as a tax deduction and that restrictions be imposed on the deductibility of business gifts, expenses of business trips combined with vacations, and excessive personal living expenses incurred on business travel away from home.\\r\\n\\r\\nI feel confident that these measures will be welcomed by the American people. I am also confident that business firms, now forced to emulate the expense account favors of their competitors, however unsound or uneconomical such practices may be, will welcome the removal of this pressure. These measures will strengthen both our tax structure and the moral fibre of our society. These provisions should be effective as of January 1, 1962 and are estimated to increase Treasury receipts by at least $250 million per year.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Capital Gains on Sale of Depreciable Business Property. Another flaw which should be corrected at this time relates to the taxation of gains on the sale of depreciable business property. Such gains are now taxed at the preferential rate applicable to capital gains, even though they represent ordinary income.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis situation arises because the statutory rate of depreciation may not coincide with the actual decline in the value of the asset. While the taxpayer holds the property, depreciation is taken as a deduction from ordinary income. Upon its resale, where the amount of depreciation allowable exceeds the decline in the actual value of the asset so that a gain occurs, this gain under present law is taxed at the preferential capital gains rate. The advantages resulting from this practice have been increased by the liberalization of depreciation rates.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur capital gains concept should not encompass this kind of income. This inequity should be eliminated, and especially so in view of the proposed investment credit. We should not encourage through tax incentives the further acquisition of such property as long as this loophole remains.\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore recommend that capital gains treatment be withdrawn from gains on the disposition of depreciable property, both personal and real property, to the extent that depreciation has been deducted for such property by the seller in previous years, permitting only the excess of the sales price over the original cost to be treated as a capital gain. The remainder should be treated as ordinary income. This reform should immediately become effective as to all sales taking place after the date of enactment. It is estimated to raise revenue by $200 million annually.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Cooperatives and Financial Institutions. Another area of the tax laws which calls for attention is the treatment of cooperatives, private lending institutions, and fire and casualty insurance companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nContrary to the intention of Congress, substantial income from certain cooperative enterprises, reflecting business operations, is not being taxed either to the cooperative organization itself or its members. This situation must be corrected in a manner that is fair and just to both the cooperatives and competing businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present inequity has resulted from court decisions which held patronage refunds in certain forms to be non-taxable. I recommend that the law be clarified so that all earnings are taxable to either the cooperatives or to their patrons, assessing the patron on the earnings that are allocated to him as patronage dividends or refunds in scrip or cash. The withholding principle recommended above should also be applied to patronage dividends or refunds so that the average patron receiving scrip will, in effect, be given the cash to pay his tax on his patronage dividend or refund. The cooperatives should not be penalized by the assessment of a patronage tax upon dividends or refunds taxable to the patron but left in the business as a substitute for the sale of securities to obtain additional equity capital. The exemption for rural electric cooperatives and credit unions should be continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tax provisions applicable to fire and casualty insurance companies, originally adopted in 1942, need to be reviewed in the light of current conditions. Many of these companies, organized on the mutual or reciprocal basis are now taxed under a special formula which does not take account of their underwritings gains and thus results in an inequitable distribution of the tax burden among various types of companies. Consideration should be given to taxing mutual or reciprocal companies on a basis similar to stock companies, following the pattern of similar treatment of stock and mutual enterprise in the life insurance field.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the most important types of private savings and lending institutions in the country are accorded tax deductible reserve provisions which substantially reduce or eliminate their Federal income tax liability. These provisions should be reviewed with the aim of assuring non-discriminatory treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemedial legislation in these fields would enlarge the revenues and contribute to a fair and sound tax structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nV. TAX ADMINISTRATION\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the major characteristics of our tax system, and one in which we can take a great deal of pride, is that it operates primarily through individual self-assessment. The integrity of such a system depends upon the continued willingness of the people honestly and accurately to discharge this annual price of citizenship. To the extent that some people are dishonest or careless in their dealings with the government, the majority is forced to carry a heavier tax burden.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor voluntary serf-assessment to be both meaningful and productive of revenues, the citizens must not only have confidence in the fairness of the tax laws, but also in their uniform and vigorous enforcement of these laws. If non-compliance by the few continues unchecked, the confidence of the many in our self-assessment system will be shaken and one of the cornerstones of our government weakened.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have in this message already recommended the application of withholding to dividends and interest and revisions to halt the abuses of expense accounts. These measures will improve taxpayer compliance and raise the regard of taxpayers for the fairness of our system. In addition, I propose three further measures to improve the tax enforcement machinery.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Taxpayer Account Numbers. The Internal Revenue Service has begun the installation of automatic data processing equipment to improve administration of the growing job of tax collection and enforcement. A system of identifying taxpayer account numbers, which would make possible the bringing together of all tax data for any one particular taxpayer, is an essential part of such an improved collection and enforcement program.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this purpose, social security numbers would be used by taxpayers already having them. The small minority currently without such numbers' would be assigned numbers which these persons could later use as well for social security purposes if needed. The numbers would be entered on tax returns, information returns, and related documents.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recommend that legislation be enacted to authorize the use of taxpayer account numbers beginning January 1, 1962 to identify taxpayer accounts throughout the processing and record keeping operations of the Internal Revenue Service.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Increased Audit Coverage. The examination of tax returns is the essence of the enforcement process. The number of examining personnel of the Internal Revenue Service, however, has been consistently inadequate to cope with the audit workload. Consequently, it has been unable to audit carefully many of the returns which should be so examined. Anticipated growth in our population will, of course, increase this enforcement problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated to broadened tax audit is the criminal enforcement program of the Revenue Service. Here, the guiding principle is the creation of a deterrent to tax evasion and to maintain or, if possible, increase voluntary compliance with all taxing statutes. This means placing an appropriate degree of investigative emphasis on all types of tax violations, in all geographical areas, and identifying violations of substance in all income brackets regardless of occupation, business or profession.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin this framework of a balanced enforcement effort, the Service is placing special investigative emphasis on returns filed by persons receiving income from illegal sources. I have directed all Federal law enforcement agencies to cooperate fully with the Attorney General in a drive against organized crime, and to utilize their resources to the maximum extent in conducting investigations of individuals engaged in criminal activity on a major scale. With the foregoing in mind, I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury to provide through the Internal Revenue Service a maximum effort in this field.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo fulfill these requirements for improved audits, enforcement and anti-crime investigation, it is essential that the Service be provided additional resources which will pay their own cost many times over. In furthering the Service's long-range plans, the prior Administration asked additional appropriations of $27.4 million to hire about 3,500 additional personnel during fiscal 1962, including provisions for the necessary increases in space and modern equipment vital to the efficient operation of the Service. To meet the commitments described above, this Administration reviewed these proposals and recommended that they be increased by another $7 million and 765 additional personnel to expedite the expansion and criminal enforcement programs. The pending alternative of only 1,995 additional personnel, or less than one-half of the number requested, this Administration would constitute little more than the additional employees needed each year during the 1960's just to keep up with the estimated growth in number and complexity of returns filed. Thus I must again strongly urge the Congress to give its full support to my original request. These increases will safeguard the long-term adequacy of the nation's traditional voluntary compliance system and, at the same time, return the added appropriations several times over in added revenue.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Inventory Reporting. It is increasingly apparent that the manipulation of inventories has become a frequent method of avoiding taxes. Current laws and regulations generally permit the use of inventory methods which are acceptable in recognized accounting practice. Deviations from these methods, which are not always easy to detect during examination of tax returns, can often lead to complete non-payment of taxes until the inventories are liquidated; and, for some taxpayers, this represents permanent tax reduction. The understating of the valuation of inventories is the device most fiequently used.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have directed the Internal Revenue Service to give increasing attention to this area of tax avoidance, through a stepped-up emphasis on both the verification of the amounts reported as inventories and an examination of methods used in arriving at their reported valuation.\\r\\n\\r\\nVI. TAX RATE EXTENSION\\r\\n\\r\\nAs recommended by my predecessor, it is again necessary that Congress enact an extension of present corporation income and excise tax rates otherwise scheduled for reduction or termination on July 1, 1961 Such extension has been adopted by the Congress on a number of previous occasions, and our present revenue requirements make such extension absolutely necessary again this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the absence of such legislation, the corporate tax rate would be decreased 5 percentage points, from 52 percent to 47 percent, excise tax rates on distilled spirits, beer, wines, cigarettes, passenger automobiles, automobile parts and accessories, and the transportation of persons would also decline; and the excise tax on general telephone service would expire. We cannot afford the loss of these revenues at this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nVII. AVIATION FUEL\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last item on the agenda relates to aviation fuel. The two previous Administrations have urged that civil aviation, a mature and growing industry, be required to pay a fair share of the costs of operating and improving the Federal airways system. The rapidly mounting costs of these essential services to air transportation makes the imposition of user charges more imperative now than ever before. The most efficient method for recovering a portion of these costs equitably from the airway users is through a tax on aviation fuel. Present law provides for a net tax of 2 cents a gallon on aviation gasoline but no tax on jet fuel. The freedom from tax of jet fuel is inequitable and is resulting in substantial revenue losses due to the transition to jet power and the resulting decline in gasoline consumption.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy predecessor recommended a flat 41/2 cent tax for both aviation gasoline and jet fuels. Such a request, however, appears to be unrealistic in view of the current financial condition of the airline industry. Therefore, I recommend:\\r\\n\\r\\n--extending the present net 2-cent rate on aviation gasoline to jet fuels;\\r\\n\\r\\n--holding this uniform rate covering both types of fuel at the 2-cent level for fiscal 1962; and\\r\\n\\r\\n--providing for annual increments in this rate of 1/2 cent after fiscal year 1962 until the portion of the cost of the airways properly allocable to civil aviation is substantially recovered by this tax.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immediate increase in revenue from this proposal is modest in comparison with anticipated airways costs; and the annual gradation of further increases is intended to moderate the impact of the tax on the air carrier industry. Should future economic or other developments warrant, a more rapid increase in the fuel tax will be recommended. The decline from the revenues estimated by my predecessor is not large, and will be met by the reforms previously proposed. I repeat my earlier recommendation that, consistent with the user charge principle, revenues from the aviation fuels tax be retained in the general fund rather than diverted to the highway trust fund.\\r\\n\\r\\nCONCLUSION\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legislation recommended in this message offers a first step toward the broader objective of tax reform. The immediate need is for encouraging economic growth through modernization and capital expansion, and to remove tax preferences for foreign investment which are no longer needed and which impair our balance of payments position. A beginning is made also toward removing some of the more glaring defects in the tax structure. The revenue gain in these proposals will offset the revenue cost of the investment credit. Finally, certain rate extensions are needed to maintain the revenue potential of our fiscal system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese items need to be done now; but they are a first step only. They will be followed next year by a second set of proposals, aimed at thorough income tax reform. Their purpose will be to broaden and unify the income tax base, and to review the entire rate structure in the light of these revisions. Let us join in solving these immediate problems in the coming months, and then join in further action to strengthen the foundations of our revenue system.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"April 20, 1961: Special Message to the Congress on Taxation\"},{\"doc_name\":\"april-27-1961-president-and-press-speech\",\"date\":\"1961-04-27T13:00:00-05:00\",\"transcript\":\"Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen:\\n I appreciate very much your generous invitation to be here tonight.\\n You bear heavy responsibilities these days and an article I read some time ago reminded me of how particularly heavily the burdens of present day events bear upon your profession.\\n You may remember that in 1851 the New York Herald Tribune, under the sponsorship and publishing of Horace Greeley, employed as its London correspondent an obscure journalist by the name of Karl Marx.\\n We are told that foreign correspondent Marx, stone broke, and with a family ill and undernourished, constantly appealed to Greeley and Managing Editor Charles Dana for an increase in his munificent salary of $5 per installment, a salary which he and Engels ungratefully labeled as the \\\"lousiest petty bourgeois cheating.\\\"\\n But when all his financial appeals were refused, Marx looked around for other means of livelihood and fame, eventually terminating his relationship with the Tribune and devoting his talents full time to the cause that would bequeath to the world the seeds of Leninism, Stalinism, revolution and the Cold War.\\n If only this capitalistic New York newspaper had treated him more kindly; if only Marx had remained a foreign correspondent, history might have been different. And I hope all publishers will bear this lesson in mind the next time they receive a poverty-stricken appeal for a small increase in the expense account from an obscure newspaper.\\n I have selected as the title of my remarks tonight \\\"The President and the Press.\\\" Some may suggest that this would be more naturally worded \\\"The President Versus the Press.\\\" But those are not my sentiments tonight.\\n It is true, however, that when a well-known diplomat from another country demanded recently that our State Department repudiate certain newspaper attacks on his colleague, it was unnecessary for us to reply that this Administration was not responsible for the press, for the press had already made it clear that it was not responsible for this Administration.\\n Nevertheless, my purpose here tonight is not to deliver the usual assault on the so-called one-party press. On the contrary, in recent months I have rarely heard any complaints about political bias in the press except from a few Republicans. Nor is it my purpose tonight to discuss or defend the televising of Presidential press conferences. I think it is highly beneficial to have some 20 million Americans regularly sit in on these conferences to observe, if I may say so, the incisive, the intelligent and the courteous qualities displayed by your Washington correspondents.\\n Nor, finally, are these remarks intended to examine the proper degree of privacy which the press should allow to any President and his family.\\n If in the last few months your White House reporters and photographers have been attending church services with regularity, that has surely done them no harm.\\n On the other hand, I realize that your staff and wire service photographers may be complaining that they do not enjoy the same green privileges at the local golf courses which they once did.\\n It is true that my predecessor did not object as I do to pictures of one's golfing skill in action. But neither on the other hand did he ever bean a Secret Service man. My topic tonight is a more sober one of concern to publishers as well as editors.\\n I want to talk about our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger. The events of recent weeks may have helped to illuminate that challenge for some; but the dimensions of its threat have loomed large on the horizon for many years. Whatever our hopes may be for the future—for reducing this threat or living with it—there is no escaping either the gravity or the totality of its challenge to our survival and to our security—a challenge that confronts us in unaccustomed ways in every sphere of human activity.\\n This deadly challenge imposes upon our society two requirements of direct concern both to the press and to the President—two requirements that may seem almost contradictory in tone, but which must be reconciled and fulfilled if we are to meet this national peril. I refer, first, to the need for far greater public information; and, second, to the need for far greater official secrecy.\\n The very word \\\"secrecy\\\" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. And no official of my Administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know.\\n But I do ask every publisher, every editor, and every newsman in the nation to reexamine his own standards, and to recognize the nature of our country's peril. In time of war, the government and the press have customarily joined in an effort, based largely on self-discipline, to prevent unauthorized disclosures to the enemy. In time of \\\"clear and present danger,\\\" the courts have held that even the privileged rights of the First Amendment must yield to the public's need for national security.\\n Today no war has been declared—and however fierce the struggle may be—it may never be declared in the traditional fashion. Our way of life is under attack. Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe. The survival of our friends is in danger. And yet no war has been declared, no borders have been crossed by marching troops, no missiles have been fired.\\n If the press is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes the self-discipline of combat conditions, then I can only say that no war ever posed a greater threat to our security. If you are awaiting a finding of \\\"clear and present danger,\\\" then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent.\\n It requires a change in outlook, a change in tactics, a change in missions—by the government, by the people, by every businessman or labor leader, and by every newspaper. For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence—on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific, and political operations.\\n Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.\\n Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security—and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.\\n For the facts of the matter are that this nation's foes have openly boasted of acquiring through our newspapers information they would otherwise hire agents to acquire through theft, bribery, or espionage; that details of this nation's covert preparations to counter the enemy's covert operations have been available to every newspaper reader, friend and foe alike; that the size, the strength, the location, and the nature of our forces and weapons, and our plans and strategy for their use, have all been pinpointed in the press and other news media to a degree sufficient to satisfy any foreign power; and that, in at least one case, the publication of details concerning a secret mechanism whereby satellites were followed required its alteration at the expense of considerable time and money.\\n The newspapers which printed these stories were loyal, patriotic, responsible, and well-meaning. Had we been engaged in open warfare, they undoubtedly would not have published such items. But in the absence of open warfare, they recognized only the tests of journalism and not the tests of national security. And my question tonight is whether additional tests should not now be adopted.\\n That question is for you alone to answer. No public official should answer it for you. No governmental plan should impose its restraints against your will. But I would be failing in my duty to the Nation, in considering all of the responsibilities that we now bear and all of the means at hand to meet those responsibilities, if I did not commend this problem to your attention, and urge its thoughtful consideration.\\n On many earlier occasions, I have said—and your newspapers have constantly said—that these are times that appeal to every citizen's sense of sacrifice and self-discipline. They call out to every citizen to weigh his rights and comforts against his obligations to the common good. I cannot now believe that those citizens who serve in the newspaper business consider themselves exempt from that appeal.\\n I have no intention of establishing a new Office of War Information to govern the flow of news. I am not suggesting any new forms of censorship or new types of security classifications. I have no easy answer to the dilemma that I have posed, and would not seek to impose it if I had one. But I am asking the members of the newspaper profession and the industry in this country to reexamine their own responsibilities, to consider the degree and the nature of the present danger, and to heed the duty of self-restraint which that danger imposes upon us all.\\n Every newspaper now asks itself, with respect to every story: \\\"Is it news?\\\" All I suggest is that you add the question: \\\"Is it in the interest of the national security?\\\" And I hope that every group in America—unions and businessmen and public officials at every level—will ask the same question of their endeavors, and subject their actions to this same exacting test.\\n And should the press of America consider and recommend the voluntary assumption of specific new steps or machinery, I can assure you that we will cooperate whole-heartedly with those recommendations.\\n Perhaps there will be no recommendations. Perhaps there is no answer to the dilemma faced by a free and open society in a cold and secret war. In times of peace, any discussion of this subject, and any action that results, are both painful and without precedent. But this is a time of peace and peril which knows no precedent in history.\\n It is the unprecedented nature of this challenge that also gives rise to your second obligation—an obligation which I share. And that is our obligation to inform and alert the American people—to make certain that they possess all the facts that they need, and understand them as well—the perils, the prospects, the purposes of our program, and the choices that we face.\\n No President should fear public scrutiny of his program. For from that scrutiny comes understanding; and from that understanding comes support or opposition. And both are necessary. I am not asking your newspapers to support the Administration, but I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people. For I have complete confidence in the response and dedication of our citizens whenever they are fully informed.\\n I not only could not stifle controversy among your readers—I welcome it. This Administration intends to be candid about its errors; for, as a wise man once said: \\\"An error doesn't become a mistake until you refuse to correct it.\\\" We intend to accept full responsibility for our errors; and we expect you to point them out when we miss them.\\n Without debate, without criticism, no Administration and no country can succeed—and no republic can survive. That is why the Athenian law-maker Solon decreed it a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy. And that is why our press was protected by the First Amendment—the only business in America specifically protected by the Constitution—not primarily to amuse and entertain, not to emphasize the trivial and the sentimental, not to simply \\\"give the public what it wants\\\"—but to inform, to arouse, to reflect, to state our dangers and our opportunities, to indicate our crises and our choices, to lead, mold, educate, and sometimes even anger public opinion.\\n This means greater coverage and analysis of international news—for it is no longer far away and foreign but close at hand and local. It means greater attention to improved understanding of the news as well as improved transmission. And it means, finally, that government at all levels, must meet its obligation to provide you with the fullest possible information outside the narrowest limits of national security—and we intend to do it.\\n It was early in the Seventeenth Century that Francis Bacon remarked on three recent inventions already transforming the world: the compass, gunpowder, and the printing press. Now the links between the nations first forged by the compass have made us all citizens of the world, the hopes and threats of one becoming the hopes and threats of us all. In that one world's efforts to live together, the evolution of gunpowder to its ultimate limit has warned mankind of the terrible consequences of failure.\\n And so it is to the printing press—to the recorder of man's deeds, the keeper of his conscience, the courier of his news—that we look for strength and assistance, confident that with your help man will be what he was born to be: free and independent.\",\"president\":\"John F.

Delegation of Women\"},{\"doc_name\":\"december-6-1961-address-national-association-manufacturers\",\"date\":\"1961-12-06\",\"transcript\":\"Mr. President, and gentlemen:\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand that President McKinley and I are the only two Presidents of the United States to ever address such an occasion. I suppose that President McKinley and I are the only two that are regarded as fiscally sound enough to be qualified for admission to this organization on an occasion such as this.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not always considered the membership of the NAM as among my strongest supporters. I'm not sure you've all approached the New Frontier with the greatest possible enthusiasm, and I was therefore somewhat nervous about accepting this invitation, until I did some studying of the history of this organization. I learned that this organization had once denounced on one occasion--I'll quote--\\\"swollen bureaucracy\\\" as among the triumphs of Karl Marx, and decried on another occasion new governmental \\\"paternalism and socialism.\\\" I was comforted when reading this very familiar language to note that I was in very good company. For the first attack I quoted was on Calvin Coolidge and the second on Herbert Hoover.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remind you of this only to indicate the happy failure of many of our most pessimistic predictions. And that is true of all of us. I recognize that in the last campaign, most of the members of this luncheon group today supported my opponent, except for a very few--who were under the impression that I was my father's son. But I hope that some of your most alarming feelings of a year ago about the imminent collapse of the whole business system if I was elected have been somewhat lessened.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have selected, I think, able men who I hope you have come to have a regard for, to serve in the responsible positions of the government. One of them here, our distinguished Secretary of Commerce, Governor Hodges, who had a long career in business; Secretary Goldberg, who I think has earned the respect of business as well as labor; Secretary of the Treasury Dillon and his Under Secretary Mr. Robert Roosa who was the Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Mr. Robert McNamara, whom many of you know, the Secretary of Defense; Mr. John McCone, who is the head of the Central Intelligence Agency succeeding Mr. Dulles; and Mr. Rusk, Secretary of State--I think they're all men of experience and also, I think, they're vitally interested in the maintenance of all kinds of freedom in this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that while we may not have been together a year ago, we are together now, and I will be the President of the United States for the next three years, and I am most anxious that while we may not agree on all matters, that goodwill at least will prevail among us and that we will both recognize that those of us who work in the national government, and all of you, are motivated by a desire to serve our country.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur responsibilities are different, but I believe that we can have a period, in the next few years, of cooperation between business and government in order to advance the common interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have read about the feeling of some businessmen that we are anti-business, and I would think that a moment's thought would show how really untrue that must be. And I say it, really, for three reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, we are committed to the defense of freedom around the world. When business does well in this country, we have full employment, and this country is moving ahead, then it strengthens our image as a prosperous and vital country in this great fight in which we are engaged. When you do well, the United States does well, and our policies abroad do well. And when you do badly, all suffer.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, we're unable to maintain the kind of high employment which we must maintain, unless you are making profits, and reinvesting, and producing; and therefore as we are committed to the goal--and we must all be in this country, of trying to make sure that everyone who wants a job will find it, then quite obviously we must make the system work, and the business community must prosper.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thirdly, and to put it on its most narrow basis, we are--in the national government, and I know--a rather unpopular partner in every one of your businesses. Our revenues come from you. When you are making profits, then we are able to meet our bills. When you fail, then we fail. So for every reason, government and business are completely interdependent and completely involved. And while we may differ on the policies which may bring this country prosperity, there is no disagreement, I am sure, on either side, about the tremendous importance of you gentlemen moving ahead, and prospering, and contributing to the growth of this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I hope, if nothing else, that my presence here today indicates that my remarks represent the views of all of us who occupy a position of responsibility in Washington today.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's not an exaggeration to say that this endeavor of building a prosperous America, in a world of free and prosperous states, of making the most of our human and material resources and avoiding the harmful effects and fluctuations of inflation and recession, are of course matters of the greatest importance to us all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it's not an exaggeration to say that this endeavor proceeds under conditions today more fraught with peril than any in our history.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs communism continues its long-range drive to impose its way of life all around the world, our strongest desire is not unnaturally to seize the initiative, to get off the defensive, to do more than react to the Soviets. But while this is not an unreasonable urge, its concrete application is more difficult. In the military arena, the initiative rests with the aggressor--a role that we shun by nature and tradition--and our alliances are largely, therefore, defensive. In the paramilitary arenas of subversion, intimidation and insurrection, an open and peaceful society is again at a disadvantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there is one area, in particular, where the initiative can and has been ours--an area of strategic importance in which we have the capacity for a still greater effort--and that is in the area of economic policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marshall Plan was an example of our initiative in this area. So were Point 4 and OECD and the Alliance for Progress. This year's new long-range program to aid in the growth of the underdeveloped regions of the world, and the unaligned nations can bring us still further gains--not merely as a blow against communism but as a blow for freedom. Of equal if not greater importance is the stunning evolution of Western European economic unity from treaty to concrete reality. And it is the success of this still-growing movement which presents the West, at this time, with an historic opportunity to seize the initiative again. The United States is, in fact, required to do so for its own self-interest and progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Communist Bloc, largely self-contained and isolated, represents an economic power already by some standards larger than that of Western Europe and gaining to some degree on the United States. But the combined output and purchasing power of the United States and Western Europe is more than twice as great as that of the entire Sino-Soviet Bloc. Though we have only half as much population, and far less than half as much territory, our coordinated economic strength will represent a powerful force for the maintenance and growth of freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut will our strength be combined and coordinated--or divided and self-defeating? Will we work together on problems of trade, payments and monetary reserve--or will our mutual strength be splintered by a network of tariff walls, exchange controls, and the pursuit of narrow self-interest in unrelated if not outright hostile policies on aid, trade, procurement, interest rates and currency?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not a debate between \\\"deficit\\\" nations and \\\"surplus\\\" nations. It is not speculation over some \\\"grand design\\\" for the future. It is a hard, practical question for every member of the Western community-involving most immediately for this nation our policies in two mutually dependent areas: our balance of payments and our balance of trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile exaggerated fears can be harmful, we would not inspire needed confidence abroad by reigning satisfaction with our international balance of payments position. In essence, that position reflects the burden of our responsibilities as the Free World's leader, the chief defender of freedom and the major source of capital investment around the world. As the cost of these responsibilities grows, and is not offset by foreign expenditures here, the monetary deficit in our relations with the rest of the world grows, except to the extent that our trade surplus (of exports over imports) can increase with it. During the previous three years, as competition in international markets increased, in spite of the fact that we had a generous balance in our favor in trade, our trade surplus did not keep pace with our needs. At the same time, higher interest rates in other countries as well as speculation in the price of gold attracted some American short-term capital away from our shores. Our balance of payments was in deficit at a rate of nearly 4 billion dollars a year; and, with its consequences extended by a weakened confidence in the dollar, we suffered over that 3-year period a net loss of 5 billion dollars in our gold reserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe complete elimination of this problem is clearly some time off--but so are any ultimately dangerous consequences. The United States still holds some 43% of the Free World's monetary gold stock, a proportion far larger than our share of its trade and clearly sufficient to tide us over a temporary deficit period--and I emphasize the words temporary deficit period--while we mount an offensive to reverse these trends. Our exports and export surplus have both been rising. The net claims of Americans against foreigners have doubled during the last decade, and the annual increase in the value of our assets abroad--which now total nearly 45 billion dollars and must always be put in the balance sheet, when we're considering the movement of gold and dollars in the value of our assets abroad--has regularly exceeded our payments deficit. Contrary to the assertion that this nation has been living beyond its means abroad, we have been increasing those means instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year, moreover, our wholesale prices have been steady. In fact, in spite of the recovery, our wholesale prices are a fraction less than they were in February, and in a very real sense, for the last three years, the United States has had generally stable prices. Confidence in the dollar has been upheld--the speculation fever against the dollar has ceased--the outflow of gold has been reduced from 2 billion dollars in the ten months before February 1961, to 450 million dollars in the last ten months and, due partly to the temporary decline in imports that accompanied the recession, our general payments deficit in 1961 will be less than half of the 1960 deficit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is cause for concern, in short, but I do not believe that there is cause for alarm. We should be blind neither to our basic strengths nor to our basic problems. A long-term deficit requires long-term solutions, and we must not be panicked by setbacks of a short-run nature or the inevitable results of a reviving economy which has increased our imports and therefore leaves us in a less favorable position than we might have expected two or three months ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor negative, shortsighted remedies will do more to weaken confidence in the dollar than strengthen it; and this Administration, therefore, during its term of office, and I repeat this, and make it as a flat statement-has no intention of imposing exchange controls, devaluing the dollar, raising trade barriers, or choking off our economic recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat we will do, and have been doing, is to take a series of positive steps to reduce our outpayments and to increase our receipts from abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst of all, we recognize, as already stressed. that this country cannot solve this problem alone. Our Allies have a vital interest in its solution. Because, let me repeat, if it were not for our national security commitments abroad, which defends our own interests and that of our Allies, the United States would have gold pouring in, rather than pouring out. It is this commitment which is extremely large and constant which gives us our problem, and should be so recognized. Our Allies, therefore, have a vital interest in the solution. Thus we have sought to increase the share of the contribution which other industrialized states are making to the less-developed world; and are seeking their assumption of a larger share of the cost of our joint defense requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe lose three billion dollars a year because of our defense expenditures. It costs us hundreds of millions of dollars to keep our troops in Western Germany. We lose nearly three hundred million dollars a year to France alone because of our defense expenditures in those areas. That three billion dollars, therefore, represents a charge in the interests of our national security, which is vitally important. That drain is serious. And it was because of that reason that President Eisenhower last year suggested the exceptional step of bringing back our dependents from Western Europe which would have saved two hundred and fifty million dollars. But three billion dollars represents the contribution which we make to our defense establishments abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason why the British, as you know, have been considering withdrawing some of their troops from bases stationed around the world is because of their balance of payments difficulty. The reason that they have been reluctant to station additional troops in Western Germany has been because of the same reason. In other words, therefore, the matter which we are now discussing, of trade, involves not only our economic wellbeing but the basic commitments of the United States to dozens of countries around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnless our balance of trade, and our surplus, is sufficient, for example, to pay for this three billions of dollars, then we have no remedy but to start pulling back. So that for those who address themselves to this subject in the coming months, they must realize that it goes to the heart of our survival as well as our economic vitality.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are working with foreign governments now and central banks on new techniques for dealing in foreign currencies; on coordinating our development aid, fiscal, debt management, monetary and other policies through the OECD; on preparing a new stand-by lending authority for the International Monetary Fund; on the prepayment of our Allies' long-term debts during this period of adverse trends; and on increasing the proportion of their own military procurement in the United States, a very important move, because of the arrangements that have been recently made, that is expected to cut our payments deficit by at least another half a billion dollars next year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, to hold our own outlays abroad to the absolute essentials, we have emphasized procurement in this country for our military aid and overseas defense, and insisted upon it for three-quarters of our economic aid. This means that our economic aid to these countries does not go as far as it once did. The South Koreans can buy fertilizer from Japan at half the cost that they can buy it here in the United States, and much less shipping. But because we are determined to protect our gold, and therefore our dollar, we have imposed the Buy American policy which means now that our losses because of economic aid abroad, our general program which amounts to about four billion dollars, is now down as far as our dollar loss to five hundred million dollars, and we are hopeful that we can squeeze it even down further. We have also substituted local currency expenditures for dollar expenditures to cover local costs wherever possible; and sought to discourage (by a change in the customs law) heavy expenditures abroad by tourists to supplement restrictions already placed on military families. I will say I was alarmed to hear the other day of a study in the Defense Department of this question of dependents abroad, which indicated that those who had no dependents abroad spent more money abroad than those with dependents, so it indicates that for every solution there are additional problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, to encourage a greater movement of funds in this direction, and to discourage transfers in these other directions, we have set up a new program to attract foreign visitors; secured passage of a tax exemption encouraging foreign central banks to invest their capital in U.S. securities; kept our own short-term interest rates high enough to avoid unnecessary outflows; and urged our Allies to free their own private capital for investment here. At the same time, we have directed the Treasury, for the first time in a generation, to buy and sell foreign currencies in the international exchange markets so as to strengthen its ability to offset unfavorable developments affecting the value of the dollar.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth, we have asked the Congress-and this is a matter which is controversial and to which this group has taken exception-we have asked the Congress to remove the artificial tax preference for American investment in highly developed countries with no capital shortage, and the unjustifiable tax avoidance loopholes available to those Americans investing in so-called \\\"tax haven\\\" nations. We do not seek to penalize those who wish to invest their capital abroad. We are committed to the free flow of capital, but we also want to make sure that our tax laws do not encourage the outward movement of capital in a way which does not serve our national purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am aware that many of you will argue that the investment abroad of these funds will mean that ultimately and in the long run these moneys will be coming back. But how long a run? And how long can we afford, without taking every responsible step, to try to bring this in balance in the short run? We can't wait till 1970, if we're losing two or three billion dollars a year. And we're now, for the first time, down to about sixteen billion, nine hundred million dollars in gold in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that I want to emphasize that however unsatisfactory you may feel it is, it is not being done to harass business, but only because it represents one additional effort to try to bring the dollar into balance. And if we can increase our trade so that our surplus in trade is sufficient to make up these figures, then this kind of tax would be unnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr, if this organization has some other plan or program--which does not affect our national security--which is more equitable, we'll be glad to listen to that. But we are concerned that while capital moves freely, the tax policies do not stimulate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I emphasize this in saying again that I do not believe that exchange controls, based on the experience of the British and others, and our unique role as the banker of the world, would be either workable or helpful. But the recent flow of our capital to nations already fully developed has been a serious drain--in the shortrun--on our current balance of payments position. The eventual return from that capital is no help to us today. And at a time when we're hardpressed to pay for the maintenance of our forces in Europe without unreasonably increasing our payments deficit and our gold outflow, I am sure you must realize that it makes no sense to be encouraging an exodus of capital through tax laws that were more appropriate at a time when Europe was deficient in capital. You probably are familiar with these figures: in 1960, the long-term outward flow of capital funds was a billion, seven hundred million dollars. The return was two billion, three hundred million dollars, and therefore you might argue that we're getting more back than we're sending out. But when those figures are broken down, we see that the outward investment into the developed countries, such as Western Europe, was a billion, five hundred million dollars, and the return was only one billion dollars, a loss therefore in dollars and potentially in gold of a half a billion dollars to these countries, while in the underdeveloped countries where we would like to see American capital be invested, we took in one billion, three hundred million and invested two hundred million dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that I would say, gentlemen, that all of the proposals which we will have to put forward in the coming months and years to try to bring this into balance--and I will say that we are going to reduce without weakening our defenses our expenditures for military purposes from three billion dollars to two billion dollars, we do have to use every available means that we have. And if this organization has suggestions as to how it may be done, we want to hear them. The best way, of course, is by increasing our exports.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth, and most important of all, we are seeking to increase our exports--and thus our surplus of exports over imports. I shall discuss our opportunities, but it is worth while recounting now that we have embarked on a stepped-up campaign of export promotion and trade fair exhibits--increased our agricultural exports--and to indicate the kind of problems that we're going to have, we send to Western Europe in agricultural exports nearly two billion dollars, which is one of our great dollar earners. We take in, in agricultural exports from Europe, only about 80 million dollars, a balance of trade for us of nearly a billion, 920 million dollars. And yet, as the Common Market begins to get more and more developed, with all of these countries beginning to face surplus problems, there isn't any doubt that one of our most important problems in maintaining this kind of dollar flow would be to maintain the free flow of our agricultural commodities into the Common Market. There's going to be no more difficult task than that, and therefore we have to recognize that this, too, may affect our balance of payments.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have broadened the Export-Import Bank's loan guarantee system--created a new program of export credit insurance-and in a variety of ways sought to help you to keep American prices competitive. This requires--if we are to avoid the inflation that will price our goods out of the world markets-price and wage restraint by both industry and labor, and responsible budget policies by the government. It requires--if we are to offer modern products efficiently produced at a low cost--a higher rate of investment in new equipment, encouraged by the fullest use of existing capacity in a strong recovery, by the investment tax credit now pending before the House Ways and Means Committee, and by the depreciation reform now under study and already put into effect on textile machinery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis organization has taken a position against our tax credit, and the reason is that you do not feel it is sufficient and you support a much more general overhaul of our depreciation. I support that, too, but our tax credit will cost a billion, 800 million in our revenue. We have suggested--and I know this has been unpopular--certain taxes to make up that revenue, because quite obviously we cannot carry out a tax reduction, in these critical times, without budget problems as difficult as they are. Therefore, while we would like, under ideal conditions, and had hoped, for example, to have a surplus this year before our additional expenditures for defense in July, it is very difficult for us to send up a broad tax depreciation scheme which might cost three billion dollars, with the expectation that other tax reductions would be added to it, at a time when we balance our budget with the greatest difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that we're not unsympathetic, and I can think of very few tax changes that would be more useful to the country in stimulating employment and keeping us competitive, particularly with Western Europe. And the only reason we have not gone further in it, and the only reason we have limited ourselves to the proposal which is now before the House Ways and Means Committee, is because we do not have the available revenue to provide for a tax reduction this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that I'm hopeful, in making your position known to the Congress this year, that while you will continue to commit yourselves to depreciation changes--and as I say, we have made some progress in textiles-you will also recognize what our budgetary problems are, and work with us in attempting to get the best arrangements we can at this time, and plan for more satisfactory arrangements in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, achieving a healthy equilibrium in our international accounts depends in part upon the cooperation of our Allies-in part upon action by the Congress--in part upon the self-discipline exercised by this Administration in its executive and budgetary policies (and here I repeat my intention to submit a balanced budget in January)--and in part upon you and other members of the business community. (Labor, too, has its responsibility for price stability, and I shall stress this tomorrow in addressing the AFLCIO.) I recognize that your efforts will be governed in part by the kind of atmosphere the government can help to create. That Is. why we intend to submit our balanced budget. The government must not be demanding more from the savings of the country, nor draining more from the available supplies of credit, when the national interest demands a priority for productive, creative investment--not only to spur our growth at home but to make sure that we can sell, and sell effectively, in markets abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut your own responsibility is great--and there are three things in particular that you can do: be competitive, through lower costs and prices and better products and productivity. Be export-minded. In a very real sense, the British used to say they exported or died. We are going to meet our commitments. We've got to export. And we have to increase our exports, and however impressive it has been in the past, it must be better in the future for the security of this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd finally, be calm, in the sense of refraining from talk which really does not represent the facts, and which causes a concern about where we are going abroad. It is my hope that when we submit our balanced budget in January, that those who look at our fiscal situation from abroad and make their judgment, will recognize that we are in control, that we are moving ahead, and that the United States is a good bet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of us must share in this effort--for this in part, as I have said, is a part of the national security. And I don't want the United States pulling troops home because we're unable to meet our problems in other ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we can be calm because our basic international position is strong--this year's deficit will be lower than last year's--our gold stores are large and the outflow is easing--we are going to make progress next year in diminishing it still further--we will submit a balanced budget--we are not undergoing a damaging inflation. We can, over the next few years, offset with the help of our Allies a billion dollars, as I have said, of our $3 billion overseas defense outlays; reduce, with the help of the Congress, the money which goes because of tax advantages; cut back still further that portion of our foreign aid procurement which is not already spent here; and take the other steps I have mentioned, including an increase in our exports, for which all the additional tools we need are well within our reach.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of those tools--one which we urgently need for our own well-being--is a new trade and tariff policy. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act expires in June of next year. It must not simply be renewed-it must be replaced. If the West is to take the initiative in the economic arena--if the United States is to keep pace with the revolutionary changes which are taking place throughout the world--if our exports are to retain and expand their position in the world market--then we need a new and bold instrument of American trade policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the world of trade is no longer the same. Some 90% of the Free World's industrial production may soon be concentrated in two great markets--the United States of America and an expanded European Common Market. Our own example--of 50 States without a trade barrier behind a common external tariff--helped to inspire the Common Market. Our support--ever since the close of World War II-has been thrown behind greater European unity. For we recognized long ago that such unity would produce a Europe in which the ancient rivalries which resulted in two world wars, for us as well as for them, could rest in peace--a Europe in which the strength and the destiny of Germany would be inextricably tied with the West--and a Europe no longer dependent upon us, but on the contrary, strong enough to share in full partnership with us the responsibilities and initiatives of the Free World.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow this new \\\"house of Europe\\\" that we sought so long, under different Administrations, is actually rising, and it means vast new changes in our outlook as well. With the accession of the United Kingdom and other European nations to the Common Market, they will have almost twice as many people as we do--it will cover nations whose economies have been growing twice as fast as ours--and it will represent an area with a purchasing power which some day will rival our own. It could be--it should be--our most reliable and profitable customer. Its consumer demands are growing--particularly for the type of goods that we produce best, for American goods not previously sold and sometimes not even known in European markets today. It is an historic meeting of need and opportunity; at the very time that we urgently need to increase our exports, to protect our balance of payments and to pay for our troops abroad, a vast new market is rising across the Atlantic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, however, the United States is to enjoy this opportunity, it must have the means to persuade the Common Market to reduce external tariffs to a level which permits our products to enter on a truly competitive basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is why a trade policy adequate to deal with a large number of small states is no longer adequate. For almost thirty years, the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act has strengthened our foreign trade policy. But today the approaches and procedures provided for in that Act are totally irrelevant to the problems and opportunities that we confront. Its vitality is gone--a fresh approach is essential--and the longer we postpone its replacement, the more painful that step will be when it finally happens.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this is no longer a matter of local economic interest but of high national policy. We can no longer haggle over item-by-item reductions with our principal trading partners, but must adjust our trading tools to keep pace with world trading patterns--and the EEC cannot bargain effectively on an item-by-item basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am proposing, in short, a new American trade initiative which will make it possible for the economic potential of these two great markets to be harnessed together in a team capable of pulling the full weight of our common military, economic and political aspirations. And I do not underrate at all the difficulties that we will have in developing this initiative. I am not proposing--nor is it either necessary or desirable--that we join the Common Market, alter our concepts of political sovereignty, establish a \\\"rich man's\\\" trading community, abandon our traditional most-favored-nations policy, create an Atlantic free trade area, or impair in any way our close economic ties with Canada, Japan and the rest of the Free World. And this, of course, is a problem of the greatest importance to us also. We do not want Japan left out of this great market, or Latin America which has depended so much on the European markets. It may find it now increasingly difficult because of competition from Africa to sell in Europe which could mean serious trouble for them and therefore for us in the long run both political as well as economic.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not proposing--nor is it either necessary or desirable--that in setting new policies on imports we do away altogether with our traditional safeguards and institutions believe we can provide more meaningful concepts of injury and relief, and far speedier proceedings. We can use tariffs to cushion adjustment instead of using them only to shut off competition. And the Federal government can aid that process of adjustment, through a program I shall discuss further tomorrow--not a welfare program, or a permanent subsidy, but a means of permitting the traditional American forces of adaptability and initiative to substitute progress for injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor obviously our imports will also increase--not as much as our exports, but they will increase. And we need those imports if other nations are to have the money to buy our exports and the incentive to lower their own tariff barriers. Because nobody is going to lower their barriers unless the United States makes a bargain with them which they feel to be in their own economic interest. We need those imports to give our consumers a wide choice of goods at competitive prices. We need those imports to give our industries and defense establishments the raw materials they require at prices they can afford--and to keep a healthy pressure on our own producers and workers to improve efficiency, develop better products, and avoid the inflation that could price us out of markets vital to our own prosperity.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, let me make it clear that I am not proposing a unilateral lowering of our trade barriers. What I am proposing is a joint step on both sides of the Atlantic, aimed at benefiting not only the exporters Of the countries concerned but the economies of all of the countries of the Free World. Led by the two great Common Markets of the Atlantic, trade barriers in all the industrial nations must be brought down. Surely it will be said that the bold vision which produced the EEC will fall short if it merely transfers European protectionism from the national to the continental level.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if we can obtain from the Congress, and successfully use in negotiations, sufficient bargaining power to lower Common Market restrictions against our goods, every segment of the American economy will benefit. There are relatively few members of the business community who do not or could not transport, distribute or process either exports or imports. There are millions of American workers whose jobs depend on the sale of our goods abroad--making industrial sewing machines, or trucks, or aircraft parts, or chemicals, or equipment for oil fields or mining or construction. They may produce lubricants or resin; they may dig coal or plant cotton. In fact, the average American farmer today depends on foreign markets to sell the crops grown on one out of every six acres he plants--in wheat, cotton, rice and tobacco, to name but a few examples. Our consumers, as mentioned, will benefit most of all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if American industry cannot increase its sales to the Common Market, and increase this nation's surplus of exports over imports, our international payments position and our commitments to the defense of freedom will be endangered.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf American businessmen cannot increase or even maintain their exports to the Common Market, they will surely step up their investment in new American-owned plants behind those tariff walls so they can compete on an equal basis--thereby taking capital away from us, as well as jobs from our own shores, and worsening still further our balance of payments position.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf American industry cannot increase its outlets in the Common Market, our own expansion will be stifled--the growth target of 50% in the sixties, adopted last month by the 20 nations of OECD for their combined gross national product, will not be reached-and our business-community will lack the incentives to lower prices and improve technology which greater competition would otherwise inspire. The industries which would benefit the most from increased trade are our most efficient--even though in many cases they pay our highest wages, their goods can compete with the goods of any other nation. Those who would benefit the least, and are unwilling to adjust to competition, are standing in the way, as the NAM Economic Advisory Committee pointed out last year, of greater growth and a higher standard of living. They are endangering the profits and jobs of others, our efforts against inflation, our balance of payments position, and in the long run their own economic wellbeing because they will suffer from competition in the U.S. inevitably, if not from abroad--for, in order to avoid exertion, they accept paralysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, let me add, if we cannot increase our sales abroad, we will diminish our stature in the Free World. Economic isolation and political leadership are wholly incompatible. The United Kingdom, faced with even more serious problems in her efforts to achieve both higher growth and reasonable balance of payments, is moving with boldness, welcoming, in the Prime Minister's words, \\\"the brisk shower of competition.\\\" We cannot do less. For if the nations of the West can weld together on these problems a common program of action as extraordinary in economic history as NATO was unprecedented in military history, the long-range Communist aim of dividing and encircling us all is doomed to failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn every sense of the word, therefore, Capitalism is on trial as we debate these issues. For many years in many lands, we have boasted of the virtues of the marketplace under free competitive enterprise, of America's ability to compete and sell, of the vitality of our system in keeping abreast with the times. Now the world will see whether we mean it or not--whether America will remain the foremost economic power in the world--or whether we will evacuate the field of power before a shot is fired, or go forth to meet new risks and tests of our ability.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hour of decision has arrived. We cannot afford to \\\"wait and see what happens,\\\" while the tide of events sweeps over and beyond us. We must use time as a tool, not as a couch. We must carve out our own destiny. This is what Americans have always done--and this, I have every confidence, is what we will continue to do in each new trial and opportunity that lies ahead.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"December 6, 1961: Address to the National Association of Manufacturers\"},{\"doc_name\":\"december-7-1961-address-miami-opening-afl-cio-convention\",\"date\":\"1961-12-07\",\"transcript\":\"Mr. Meany, Reverend Clergy, Governor Bryant, gentlemen, ladies:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's warmer here today than it was yesterday!\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to express my pleasure at this invitation. As one whose work and continuity of employment has depended in part upon the union movement, I want to say that I have been on the job, training for about 11 months, and feel that I have some seniority rights in the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm delighted to be here with you and with Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg. I was up in New York stressing physical fitness, and in line with that Arthur went over with a group to Switzerland to climb some of the mountains there. They all got up about 5 and he was in bed--got up to join them later--and when they all came back at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, he didn't come back with them. They sent out search parties and there was no sign of him that afternoon or night. Next day the Red Cross went out and they went around calling \\\"Goldberg--Goldberg--it's the Red Cross.\\\" And this voice came down the mountain, \\\"I gave at the office.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThose are the liberties you can take with members of the Cabinet. But I want to say it's a pleasure to be here. This is an important anniversary for all of us, the 20th anniversary of Pearl Harbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose, really, the only two dates that most people remember where they were, were Pearl Harbor and the death of President Franklin Roosevelt. We face entirely different challenges on this Pearl Harbor. In many ways the challenges are more serious, and in a sense long-reaching, because I don't think that any of us had any doubt in those days that the United States would survive and prevail and our strength increase.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we are face to face in a most critical time with challenges all around the world, and you in the labor movement bear a heavy responsibility. Occasionally I read articles by those who say that the labor movement has fallen into dark days. I don't believe that, and I would be very distressed if it were true.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the great qualities about the United States which I don't think people realize who are not in the labor movement, is what a great asset for freedom the American labor movement represents, not only here but all around the world. It's no accident that Communists concentrate their attention on the trade union movement. They know that people--the working people-are frequently left out, that in many areas of the world they have no one to speak for them, and the Communists mislead them and say that they will protect their rights. So many go along.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the United States, because we have had a strong, free labor movement, the working people of this country have not felt that they were left out. And as long as the labor movement is strong and as long as it is committed to freedom, then I think that freedom in this country is strengthened. So I would hope that every American, whether he was on one side of the bargaining table or the other or whether he was in a wholly different sphere of life, would recognize that the strength of a free American labor movement is vital to the maintenance of freedom in this country and all around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I am delighted that there are here today, I understand, nearly 150 trade union leaders from nearly 32 countries around the world. I believe--and I say this as President-that one of the great assets that this country has is the influence which this labor movement can promote around the world in demonstrating what a free trade union can do.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope that they will go back from this meeting recognizing that in the long run a strong labor movement is essential to the maintenance of democracy in their country. It's no accident that there has not been a strike in the Soviet Union for 30, or 35, or 40 years. The Communists who in Latin America, or Africa, or Asia say that they represent the people, cannot possibly--under any rule of reason or debate--say that a labor movement is free when it is not able to express its rights, not only in relationship to the employer but also to speak out and recognize the limitations of governmental power. We are not omniscient--we are not all-powerful--this is a free society, and management and labor, and the farmer and the citizen have their rights. We did not give them their rights in government. And I hope that those who go from this hall to Latin America, to Europe, to Africa, will recognize that we believe in freedom and in progress in this country, that we believe that freedom is not an end in itself, but we believe that freedom can bring material abundance and prosperity. And I want you to know that I consider this meeting and the house of labor vital to the interests of this country and the cause of freedom in the coming days.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat unites labor, what unites this country, is far more important than those things on which we may disagree. So, gentlemen and ladies, you are not only leaders of your unions but you occupy a .position of responsibility as citizens of the United States; and therefore I felt it most appropriate to come here today and talk with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, I want to express my appreciation to you for several things. For example, I appreciate the effort that those of you who represent the interests of the men and women who work at our missile plants have made. The fact that you have given and that the men and women who work there have lived up to the no-strike pledge at our missile and space sites has made an appreciable difference in the progress that we are making in these areas--and the country appreciates the effort you are making.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, we have for the first time a Presidential Advisory Committee on Labor-Management Policy which for once did not break up on the passage of the Wagner Act in 1935, but instead meets month by month in an attempt to work out and develop economic policies which will permit this country to go forward under conditions of full employment. And I want to thank you for the participation you have given that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, as I said, I want to thank the labor movement for what it is doing abroad in strengthening the free labor movement, and I urge you to redouble your efforts. The hope, as I have said, of freedom in these countries rests in many parts with the labor movement. We do not want to leave the people of some countries a choice between placing their destiny in the hands of a few who hold in their hands most of the property and on the other side the Communist movement. We do not give them that choice. We want them to have the instruments of freedom to protect themselves and provide for progress in their country, and a strong, free labor movement can do it--and I hope you will concentrate your attention in the next 12 months in that area--in Latin America and all around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is that the head of the Congo-Adoula--who has been a strong figure for freedom, came out of the labor movement. And that's happening in country after country. And this is a great opportunity and responsibility for all of us to continue to work together.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd finally, I want to take this opportunity to express my thanks to the AFLCIO for the support that it gave in the passage of our legislative program in the long session of the Congress. We did not always agree on every tactic. We may not have achieved every goal, but we can take some satisfaction in the fact that we did make progress toward a $1.25 minimum wage, that we did expand the coverage for the first time in 20 years; that we did pass the best housing act since 1949; that we did, finally, after two Presidential vetoes in the last 4 years, pass a bill providing assistance to those areas suffering from chronic unemployment; that we did pass a long-range water pollution bill; that we did pass increased Social Security benefits, a lowering of the retirement age in Social Security from 65 to 62 for men, temporary unemployment compensation, and aid to dependent children.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we are coming back in January and we are going to start again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gross National Product has climbed since January from $500 billion to an estimated $540 billion in the last quarter, and it's a pleasure for me to say that the November employment figures received this morning show not only two million more people than were working in February, but we have now an all-time high for November, 67,349,000 people working. But, more importantly, unlike the usual seasonal run in November, which ordinarily provides for an increase in unemployment of about a half a million, we have now brought the figure for the first time below the 7 percent where it's hovered down to 6.1 percent, and we're going to have to get it lower.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would not claim we've achieved full .recovery or the permanently high growth rate of which we are capable. Since the recession of '58, from which we only partially recovered, and going into the recession of 1960, too many men and women have been idle for too long a time and our first concern must still be with those unable to get work. Unemployment compensation must be placed on a permanent, rational basis of nationwide standards, and even more importantly those who are older and retired must be permitted under a system of Social Security to get assistance and relief from the staggering cost of their medical bills.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time has come in the next session of the Congress to face the fact that our eider citizens do need these benefits, that their needs cannot be adequately met in any other way, and that every Member of the Congress should have the opportunity to go on the record, up or down, on this question-and I believe when it comes to the floor--as I believe it must--they are going to vote it up and through before they adjourn in July or August.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there are six areas that I believe that we need to give our attention to if the manpower budget is to be balanced. First, we must give special attention to the problems of our younger people. Dr. Conant's recent book only highlighted a fact which all of you are familiar with, and that is the problem of those who drop out of school before they have finished, because of hardships in their home, inadequate motivation or counseling or whatever it may be, and then drift without being able to find a decent job.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this falls particularly heavily upon the young men and women who are in our minority groups. In addition to that, 26 million young people will be crowding into the labor market in the next 10 years. This can be a tremendous asset because we have many tasks that require their talent. But today there are one million young Americans under the age of 25 who are out of school and out of work. Millions of others leave school early, destined to fall for life into a pattern of being untrained, unskilled, and frequently unemployed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's for this reason that I have asked the Congress to pass a Youth Employment Opportunities Act to guide these hands so that they can make a life for themselves. Equally important, if our young people are to be well trained and skilled labor is going to be needed in the next years, and if they are to be inspired to finish their studies, the Federal Government must meet its responsibility in the field of education. I'm not satisfied if my particular community has a good school. I want to make sure that every child in this country has an adequate opportunity for a good education.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Jefferson once said, \\\"If you expect a country to be ignorant and free, you expect what never was and never will be.\\\" It's not enough that our own home town has a good school, we want the United States as a country to be among the best educated in the world. And I believe that we must invest in our youth.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, we need a program of retraining our unemployed workers. All of you who live so close to this problem know what happens when technology changes and industries move out and men are left. And I've seen it in my own State of Massachusetts where textile workers were unemployed, unable to find work even with new electronic plants going up all around them. We want to make sure that our workers are able to take advantage of the new jobs that must inevitably come as technology changes in the 1960's. And I believe, therefore, that retraining deserves the attention of this Congress in the coming days.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the third group requiring our attention consists of our minority citizens. All of you know the statistics of those who are first discharged and the last to be rehired too often are among those who are members of our minority groups. We want everyone to have a chance, regardless of their race or color, to have an opportunity to make a life for themselves and their families, to get a decent education so they have a fair chance to compete, and then be judged on what's in here and not on what's on the outside. And the American labor movement has been identified with this cause, and I know that you will be in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we are making a great effort to make sure that all those who secure Federal contracts--and there are billions of dollars spent each year by the Federal Government--will give fair opportunity to all of our citizens to participate in that work.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth, we want to provide opportunities for plant re-investment. One of the matters which is of concern in maintaining our economy now is the fact that we do not have as much re-investment in our plants as we did, for example, in 1955, '56 and '57' And we want this economy and this rise to be continuous. And I believe we have to give as much incentive as is possible to provide reinvestment in plants which makes work and will keep our economy moving ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd therefore I have suggested a tax credit, which I'm hopeful the American labor movement has not placed on its list of those matters yet that it has not supported, but it will consider this proposal as a method of stimulating the economy so that this recovery does not run out of gas in 12 months or 18 months from now, as the 1958-59 recovery, after the recession of 1958, ran out in\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth, to add to our arsenals of built-in stabilizers so we can keep our economy moving ahead, it's my intention to ask the Congress at its next session for stand-by authority somewhat along the lines of the bill introduced by Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, to make grants-in-aid to communities for needed public works when our unemployment begins to mount and our economy to slow down.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixth and finally, we must expand our job opportunities by stimulating our trade abroad. I know that this is a matter to which the labor movement has given a good deal of attention. Mr. Meany made an outstanding speech on this matter several weeks ago, and it's a matter which is of concern to this administration. I'm sure you wonder, perhaps, why we're placing so much emphasis on it, and I would like to say why we are, very briefly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first is, this country must maintain a favorable balance of trade or suffer severely from the point of view of our national security. We sell abroad now nearly $5 billion more than we import. But unfortunately that $5 billion goes abroad in order to maintain the national security requirements of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spend $3 billion of that in order to keep our troops overseas. It costs us nearly $700 to $800 million to keep our divisions in Western Germany, and $300 million to keep our troop establishments in France. And what is true in France and Germany, which are outposts of our commitments, is true in other areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that if we're not able to maintain a favorable balance of trade, then of course we will have to do as the British have had to do, which is begin to bring our troops back and lay the way open for other actions. So that this is a matter which involves very greatly our security, and unless you believe that the United States should retreat to our own hemisphere and forget our commitments abroad, then you can share with me my concern about what will happen if that balance of trade begins to drop.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the problems that we face have been intensified by the development of the Common Market. This is our best market for manufactured products. What I am concerned about is that we shall be able to keep moving our trade into those areas; otherwise what we will find is that American capital which cannot place its goods in that market will decide, as they are doing now, to build their plants in Western Europe, and then they hire Western European workers-and you suffer, and the country suffers, and the balance of payments suffers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo this is a matter of the greatest importance to you--in fact, to all Americans. It is, for example, of the greatest importance to American farmers. They sell $2 billion of agricultural commodities to Western Europe. We bring in $80 million of agricultural commodities from Western Europe. In other words, we make almost $2 billion of our foreign exchange from that sale of agricultural commodities, and yet Western Europe has great agricultural resources which are increasing, and we are going to find it increasingly difficult unless we are able to negotiate from a position of strength with them. So this matter is important.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe purpose of this discussion is to increase employment. The purpose of this discussion is to strengthen the United States, and it is a matter which deserves our most profound attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre we going to export our goods and our crops or, are we going to export our capital? That's the question that we're now facing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I know that those of you who have been concerned about this know this to be a major problem. Last year, 1960, we invested abroad $1,700 million, and we took in from our investments abroad $2,300 million-which sounded like it was a pretty good exchange. But if you analyze these figures you will see that we took in, from the underdeveloped world, which needs capital, we took in $1,300 million and we sent out in capital for investment $200 million. And yet this is the area that needs our investment. While in Western Europe we sent out $1,500 million and took in $1 billion. So that if this trend should continue and more and more Western Europe became the object of American investment, it affects us all and affects the people who work with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are attempting to repeal those tax privileges which make it particularly attractive for American capital to invest in Western Europe. We passed laws in the days of the Marshall Plan when we wanted American capital over there, and as the result of that, there are provisions on the tax book which make it good business to go over there.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we want it all to be fair, and we have stated we are not putting in exchange controls, which we will not. But we recommended in January the passage of a bill which would lessen the tax privileges of investing in Western Europe and which would have given us $250 million in revenue and in balance of payments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tax privileges or the attractions should be in the underdeveloped world, where we have been taking capital out rather than putting it in, and not in Western Europe where the capital is sufficient and which does not serve that great national purpose. So this is a matter of concern for all of us and it is a matter which we must consider in the coming months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Common Market is a tremendous market. It has more people than we do. Its rate of growth is twice ours. Its income is about three-fifths of ours, and may some day be equal to ours. This can be a great asset not only to them but to us--a great strength tying Western Europe, the United States, and Latin America and Japan together as a great area of freedom. And I think that it represents one of the most hopeful signs since 1945. It is one place where the Free World can be on the offensive. And I'm anxious that the United States play its proper role to protect the interests of our people and to advance the cause of freedom. And I ask the careful consideration of the American labor movement in this area.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the problems which we have is to recognize that those who have been affected by imports have received no protection at all for a number of years from the United States Government. When I was a Senator in 1954, I introduced legislation to provide assistance to those industries which are hard-hit by imports. I am going to recommend in January a program which I hope the Congress will pass, which will provide a recognition of the national responsibility in the period of transition for those industries and people who may be adversely affected.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am optimistic about the future of this country. This is a great country, with an energetic people, and I believe over the. long period the people of .this country and of the world really want freedom and wish to solve their own lives and their own destiny. I'm hopeful that we can be associated with that movement. I'm hopeful that you will continue to meet your responsibilities to your people as well as to the country. I hope that we can maintain a viable economy here with full employment. I'm hopeful we can be competitive here and around the world. I'm hopeful that management and labor will recognize their responsibility to permit us to compete, that those of you who are in the area of wage negotiations will recognize the desirability of us maintaining as stable prices as possible, and that the area of productivity and stable prices--that your negotiations will take adequate calculation and account of this need for us to maintain a balance of trade in our favor. In the long run it's in the interests of your own workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me repeat: If we cannot maintain the balance of trade in our favor, which it now is, of $5 billion, and indeed increase it, then this country is going to face most serious problems. In the last 3 years, even though the balance of trade in our favor has been $5 billion, we have lost $5 billion in gold; and if this trend should go on year after year then the United States, as I have said, would have to make adjustments which would be extremely adverse to the cause of freedom around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solution rests with increasing our export trade, with remaining competitive, with our businesses selling abroad, finding new markets, and keeping our people working at home and around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it is a fact that the six countries of the Common Market who faced the problems that we now face, have had in the last 4 years full employment and an economic growth twice ours. Even a country which faced staggering economic problems a decade ago--Italy--has been steadily building its gold balance, cutting down its unemployment and moving ahead twice what we have over the last 4 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what I am talking about is an opportunity, not a burden. This is a chance to move the United States forward in the 1960's, not only in the economic sphere but also to make a contribution to the cause of freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I come to Miami today and ask your help, as on other occasions other Presidents of the United States, stretching back to the time of Woodrow Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman, have come to the AF of L and the CIO--and each time this organization has said yes.\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"December 7, 1961: Address in Miami at the Opening of the AFL-CIO Convention\"},{\"doc_name\":\"february-21-1961-remarks-youth-fitness-program\",\"date\":\"1961-02-21\",\"transcript\":\"Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Secretary:\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to express my great appreciation at the opportunity to be here with you, and to express my thanks to all of you for having attended this conference.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked those members of the Cabinet who felt they were physically fit to come here today, and I am delighted that Mr. Udall and Mr. Robert Kennedy and Governor Ribicoff responded to the challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome years ago, another President of the United States who was also interested in physical fitness, Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, expressed some ambition that--I think members of the armed services would improve their physical fitness. As there was some question about his, you will recall that he then rode a horse for a hundred miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe don't have to prove it in 1961. We take it for granted that the members of the administration are all physically fit and our presence here today is an effort to encourage all of you in your work.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the time of the ancient Greeks, we have always felt that there was a close relationship between a strong, vital mind and physical fitness. It is our hope that using the influence of the National Government that we can expand this strong spirit among American men and women, that they will concern themselves with this phase of their personal development.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not want in the United States a nation of spectators. We want a nation of participants in the vigorous life. This is not a matter which can be settled, of course, from Washington. It is really a matter which starts with each individual family. It is my hope that mothers and fathers, stretching across the United States, will be concerned about this phase of their children's development, that the communities will be concerned to make it possible for young boys and girls to participate actively in the physical life, and that men and women who have reached the age of maturity will concern themselves with maintaining their own participation in this phase of national vigor--national life.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am hopeful that we can develop here today, with your help and suggestions, a program which will inspire our country to be concerned. I don't think we have to read these tests which we have seen so much of during the last 10 years to realize that because of the generosity of nature, because of the way our society is organized, that there has been less emphasis on national vigor, national vitality, physical well-being, than there has been in many other countries of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to do better. And I think you want to do better. We want to make sure that as our life becomes more sophisticated, as we become more urbanized, that we don't lose this very valuable facet of our national character: physical vitality, which is tied into qualities of character, which is tied into qualities of intellectual vigor and vitality.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I think that you are performing a real service in being here. We want your suggestions and ideas. This has to flow two ways, and we want the flow today to. come from you to tell us how you think we can use the influence of the National Government-its prestige--in order to increase the emphasis which we can place in every community across the country, in every home, in this most important program.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am particularly glad that we have here today teachers from over 67 countries who have been teaching in the United States and traveling through it, and who have now come to the National Capital before they return home. I hope they realize how much we learn from them--this is a two-way street, and all of these program which have brought hundreds of teachers in the last 15 to 20 years, which have brought them to all parts of the country; that each of you leaves behind you an understanding of the problems and opportunities of your country, your culture, your civilization, what you believe; and by your looking at us, we see something of ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a program which we benefit from. In many ways, I think, we are the greater beneficiary, and I hope that when you go back to your countries, that you will tell them something of what we are trying to do here. You will tell them, though we may not always realize our high ambitions and our high goals, that nevertheless we are attempting to advance ourselves, and that there is tremendous interest in what is going on in the world around us.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the fall, I spoke, as many Members of Congress have spoken, about a Peace Corps. I am hopeful that it will be possible to bring that into realization, but what has been most interesting has been the great response of young men and women who desire not merely to serve the United States, but who desire to serve the cause of freedom which is common I think to all countries and to all people.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope that when the Peace Corps ultimately is organized, and young men and women go out around the world, that they will place their greatest emphasis on teaching; and secondly, that they will learn themselves far more than they will teach, and that we will therefore have another link which binds us to the world around us.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to express my thanks to all of you, whether you come from across the sea or here in the United States. We are all involved in this great effort together. And therefore I wish you well. I express my thanks to all of you. I want you to know that we here in Washington are intimately concerned with the matters in which you are engaged.\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"February 21, 1961: Remarks on the Youth Fitness Program\"},{\"doc_name\":\"january-11-1962-state-union-address\",\"date\":\"1962-01-11\",\"transcript\":\"Mr. Vice President, my old colleague from Massachusetts and your new Speaker, John McCormack, Members of the 87th Congress, ladies and gentlemen:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis week we begin anew our joint and separate efforts to build the American future. But, sadly, we build without a man who linked a long past with the present and looked strongly to the future. \\\"Mister Sam\\\" Rayburn is gone. Neither this House nor the Nation is the same without him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of the Congress, the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress. We are all trustees for the American people, custodians of the American heritage. It is my task to report the State of the Union--to improve it is the task of us all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past year, I have traveled not only across our own land but to other lands-to the North and the South, and across the seas. And I have found--as I am sure you have, in your travels--that people everywhere, in spite of occasional disappointments, look to us--not to our wealth or power, but to the splendor of our ideals. For our Nation is commissioned by history to be either an observer of freedom's failure or the cause of its success. Our overriding obligation in the months ahead is to fulfill the world's hopes by fulfilling our own faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat task must begin at home. For if we cannot fulfill our own ideals here, we cannot expect others to accept them. And when the youngest child alive today has grown to the cares of manhood, our position in the world will be determined first of all by what provisions we make today--for his education, his health, and his opportunities for a good home and a good job and a good life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt home, we began the year in the valley of recession--we completed it on the high road of recovery and growth. With the help of new congressionally approved or administratively increased stimulants to our economy, the number of major surplus labor u areas has declined from 101 to 60; nonagricultural employment has increased by more than a million jobs; and the average factory work-week has risen to well over 40 hours. At year's end the economy which Mr. Khrushchev once called a \\\"stumbling horse\\\" was racing to new records in consumer spending, labor income, and industrial production.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are gratified--but we are not satisfied. Too many unemployed are still looking for the blessings of prosperity- As those who leave our schools and farms demand new jobs, automation takes old jobs away. To expand our growth and job opportunities, I urge on the Congress three measures:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, the Manpower Training and Development Act, to stop the waste of able-bodied men and women who want to work, but whose only skill has been replaced by a machine, or moved with a mill, or shut down with a mine;\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, the Youth Employment Opportunities Act, to help train and place not only the one million young Americans who are both out of school and out of work, but the twenty-six million young Americans entering the labor market in this decade; and\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, the 8 percent tax credit for investment in machinery and equipment, which, combined with planned revisions of depreciation allowances, will spur our modernization, our growth, and our ability to compete abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover--pleasant as it may be to bask in the warmth of recovery--let us not forget that we have suffered three recessions in the last 7 years. The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining--by filling three basic gaps in our anti-recession protection. We need:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, presidential standby authority, subject to congressional veto, to adjust personal income tax rates downward within a specified range and time, to slow down an economic decline before it has dragged us all down;\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, presidential standby authority, upon a given rise in the rate of unemployment, to accelerate Federal and federally-aided capital improvement programs; and\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, a permanent strengthening of our unemployment compensation system--to maintain for our fellow citizens searching for a job who cannot find it, their purchasing power and their living standards without constant resort--as we have seen in recent years by the Congress and the administrations-to temporary supplements.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we enact this six-part program, we can show the whole world that a free economy need not be an unstable economy--that a free system need not leave men unemployed--and that a free society is not only the most productive but the most stable form of organization yet fashioned by man.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut recession is only one enemy of a free economy--inflation is another. Last year, 1961, despite rising production and demand, consumer prices held almost steady--and wholesale prices declined. This is the best record of overall price stability of any comparable period of recovery since the end of World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\nInflation too often follows in the shadow of growth--while price stability is made easy by stagnation or controls. But we mean to maintain both stability and growth in a climate of freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur first line of defense against inflation is the good sense and public spirit of business and labor--keeping their total increases in wages and profits in step with productivity. There is no single statistical test to guide each company and each union. But I strongly urge them--for their country's interest, and for their own--to apply the test of the public interest to these transactions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin this same framework of growth and wage-price stability:\\r\\n\\r\\n--This administration has helped keep our economy competitive by widening the access of small business to credit and Government contracts, and by stepping up the drive against monopoly, price-fixing, and racketeering;\\r\\n\\r\\n--We will submit a Federal Pay Reform bill aimed at giving our classified, postal, and other employees new pay scales more comparable to those of private industry;\\r\\n\\r\\n--We are holding the fiscal 1962 budget deficit far below the level incurred after the last recession in 1958; and, finally,\\r\\n\\r\\n--I am submitting for fiscal 1963 a balanced Federal Budget.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a joint responsibility, requiring Congressional cooperation on appropriations, and on three sources of income in particular:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, an increase in postal rates, to end the postal deficit;\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, passage of the tax reforms previously urged, to remove unwarranted tax preferences, and to apply to dividends and to interest the same withholding requirements we have long applied to wages; and\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, extension of the present excise and corporation tax rates, except for those changes--which will be recommended in a message--affecting transportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a stronger nation and economy require more than a balanced Budget. They require progress in those programs that spur our growth and fortify our strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nA strong America depends on its cities-America's glory, and sometimes America's shame. To substitute sunlight for congestion and progress for decay, we have stepped up existing urban renewal and housing programs, and launched new ones--redoubled the attack on water pollution--speeded aid to airports, hospitals, highways, and our declining mass transit systems--and secured new weapons to combat organized crime, racketeering, and youth delinquency, assisted by the coordinated and hard-hitting efforts of our investigative services: the FBI, the Internal Revenue, the Bureau of Narcotics, and many others. We shall need further anti-crime, mass transit, and transportation legislation--and new tools to fight air pollution. And with all this effort under way, both equity and commonsense require that our nation's urban areas--containing three-fourths of our population--sit as equals at the Cabinet table. I urge a new Department of Urban Affairs and Housing.\\r\\n\\r\\nA strong America also depends on its farms and natural resources. American farmers took heart in 1961--from a billion dollar rise in farm income--and from a hopeful start on reducing the farm surpluses. But we are still operating under a patchwork accumulation of old laws, which cost us $1 billion a year in CCC carrying charges alone, yet fail to halt rural poverty or boost farm earnings.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur task is to master and turn to fully fruitful ends the magnificent productivity of our farms and farmers. The revolution on our own countryside stands in the sharpest contrast to the repeated farm failures of the Communist nations and is a source of pride to us all. Since 1950 our agricultural output per man-hour has actually doubled! Without new, realistic measures, it will someday swamp our farmers and our taxpayers in a national scandal or a farm depression.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will, therefore, submit to the Congress a new comprehensive farm program--tailored to fit the use of our land and the supplies of each crop to the long-range needs of the sixties--and designed to prevent chaos in the sixties with a program of commonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also need for the sixties--if we are to bequeath our full national estate to our heirs--a new long-range conservation and recreation program--expansion of our superb national parks and forests--preservation of our authentic wilderness areas-new starts on water and power projects as our population steadily increases--and expanded REA generation and transmission loans.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut America stands for progress in human rights as well as economic affairs, and a strong America requires the assurance of full and equal rights to all its citizens, of any race or of any color. This administration has shown as never before how much could be done through the full use of Executive powers--through the enforcement of laws already passed by the Congress-through persuasion, negotiation, and litigation, to secure the constitutional rights of all: the right to vote, the right to travel Without hindrance across State lines, and the right to free public education.\\r\\n\\r\\nI issued last March a comprehensive order to guarantee the right to equal employment opportunity in all Federal agencies and contractors. The Vice President's Committee thus created has done much, including the voluntary \\\"Plans for progress\\\" which, in all sections of the country, are achieving a quiet but striking success in opening up to all races new professional, supervisory, and other job opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there is much more to be done--by the Executive, by the courts, and by the Congress. Among the bills now pending before you, on which the executive departments will comment in detail, are appropriate methods of strengthening these basic rights which have our full support. The right to vote, for example, should no longer be denied through such arbitrary devices on a local level, sometimes abused, such as literacy tests and poll taxes. As we approach the 100th anniversary, next January, of the Emancipation Proclamation, let the acts of every branch of the Government--and every citizen--portray that \\\"righteousness does exalt a nation.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, a strong America cannot neglect the aspirations of its citizens--the welfare of the needy, the health care of the elderly, the education of the young. For we are not developing the Nation's wealth for its own sake. Wealth is the means--and people arc the ends. All our material riches will avail us little if we do not use them to expand the opportunities of our people.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast year, we improved the diet of needy people--provided more hot lunches and fresh milk to school children built more college dormitories--and, for the elderly, expanded private housing, nursing homes, heath services, and social security. But we have just begun.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo help those least fortunate of all, I am recommending a new public welfare program, stressing services instead of support, rehabilitation instead of relief, and training for useful work instead of prolonged dependency.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo relieve the critical shortage of doctors and dentists--and this is a matter which should concern us all--and expand research, I urge action to aid medical and dental colleges and scholarships and to establish new National Institutes of Health.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo take advantage of modern vaccination achievements, I am proposing a mass immunization program, aimed at the virtual elimination of such ancient enemies of our children as polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo protect our consumers from the careless and the unscrupulous, I shall recommend improvements in the Food and Drug laws-strengthening inspection and standards, halting unsafe and worthless products, preventing misleading labels, and cracking down on the illicit sale of habit-forming drugs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in matters of health, no piece of unfinished business is more important or more urgent than the enactment under the social security system of health insurance for the aged.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor our older citizens have longer and more frequent illnesses, higher hospital and medical bills and too little income to pay them. Private health insurance helps very few--for its cost is high and its coverage limited. Public welfare cannot help those too proud to seek relief but hard-pressed to pay their own bills. Nor can their children or grandchildren always sacrifice their own health budgets to meet this constant drain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial security has long helped to meet the hardships of retirement, death, and disability. I now urge that its coverage be extended without further delay to provide health insurance for the elderly.\\r\\n\\r\\nEqually important to our strength is the quality of our education. Eight million adult Americans are classified as functionally illiterate. This is a disturbing figure--reflected in Selective Service rejection rates-reflected in welfare rolls and crime rates. And I shall recommend plans for a massive attack to end this adult illiteracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall also recommend bills to improve educational quality, to stimulate the arts, and, at the college level, to provide Federal loans for the construction of academic facilities and federally financed scholarships.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this Nation is to grow in wisdom and strength, then every able high school graduate should have the opportunity to develop his talents. Yet nearly half lack either the funds or the facilities to attend college. Enrollments are going to double in our colleges in the short space of 10 years. The annual cost per student is skyrocketing to astronomical levels--now averaging $1,650 a year, although almost half of our families earn less than $5,000. They cannot afford such costs--but this Nation cannot afford to maintain its military power and neglect its brainpower.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut excellence in education must begin at the elementary level. I sent to the Congress last year a proposal for Federal aid to public school construction and teachers' salaries. I believe that bill, which passed the Senate and received House Committee approval, offered the minimum amount required by our needs and--in terms of across-the-board aid--the maximum scope permitted by our Constitution. I therefore see no reason to weaken or withdraw that bill: and I urge its passage at this session.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Civilization,\\\" said H. G. Wells, \\\"is a race between education and catastrophe.\\\" It is up to you in this Congress to determine the winner of that race.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are not unrelated measures addressed to specific gaps or grievances in our national life. They are the pattern of our intentions and the foundation of our hopes. \\\"I believe in democracy,\\\" said Woodrow Wilson, \\\"because it releases the energy of every human being.\\\" The dynamic of democracy is the power and the purpose of the individual, and the policy of this administration is to give to the individual the opportunity to realize his own highest possibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur program is to open to all the opportunity for steady and productive employment, to remove from all the handicap of arbitrary or irrational exclusion, to offer to all the facilities for education and health and welfare, to make society the servant of the individual and the individual the source of progress, and thus to realize for all the full promise of American life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of these efforts at home give meaning to our efforts abroad. Since the close of the Second World War, a global civil war has divided and tormented mankind. But it is not our military might, or our higher standard of living, that has most distinguished us from our adversaries. It is our belief that the state is the servant of the citizen and not his master.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis basic clash of ideas and wills is but one of the forces reshaping our globe--swept as it is by the tides of hope and fear, by crises in the headlines today that become mere footnotes tomorrow. Both the successes and the setbacks of the past year remain on our agenda of unfinished business. For every apparent blessing contains the seeds of danger--every area of trouble gives out a ray of hope--and the one unchangeable certainty is that nothing is certain or unchangeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet our basic goal remains the same: a peaceful world community of free and independent states--free to choose their own future and their own system, so long as it does not threaten the freedom of others.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome may choose forms and ways that we would not choose for ourselves--but it is not for us that they are choosing. We can welcome diversity--the Communists cannot. For we offer a world of choice--they offer the world of coercion. And the way of the past shows dearly that freedom, not coercion, is the wave of the future. At times our goal has been obscured by crisis or endangered by conflict--but it draws sustenance from five basic sources of strength:\\r\\n\\r\\n--the moral and physical strength of the United States;\\r\\n\\r\\n--the united strength of the Atlantic Community;\\r\\n\\r\\n--the regional strength of our Hemispheric relations;\\r\\n\\r\\n--the creative strength of our efforts in the new and developing nations; and\\r\\n\\r\\n--the peace-keeping strength of the United Nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur moral and physical strength begins at home as already discussed. But it includes our military strength as well. So long as fanaticism and fear brood over the affairs of men, we must arm to deter others from aggression.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past 12 months our military posture has steadily improved. We increased the previous defense budget by 15 percent--not in the expectation of war but for the preservation of peace. We more than doubled our acquisition rate of Polaris submarines--we doubled the production capacity for Minuteman missiles--and increased by 50 percent the number of manned bombers standing ready on a 15 minute alert. This year the combined force levels planned under our new Defense budget--including nearly three hundred additional Polaris and Minuteman missiles--have been precisely calculated to insure the continuing strength of our nuclear deterrent.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut our strength may be tested at many levels. We intend to have at all times the capacity to resist non-nuclear or limited attacks--as a complement to our nuclear capacity, not as a substitute. We have rejected any all-or-nothing posture which would leave no choice but inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus we have doubled the number of ready combat divisions in the Army's strategic reserve--increased our troops in Europe--built up the Marines--added new sealift and airlift capacity--modernized our weapons and ammunition--expanded our anti-guerrilla forces--and increased the active fleet by more than 70 vessels and our tactical air forces by nearly a dozen wings.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause we needed to reach this higher long-term level of readiness more quickly, 155,000 members of the Reserve and National Guard were activated under the Act of this Congress. Some disruptions and distress were inevitable. But the overwhelming majority bear their burdens--and their Nation's burdens--with admirable and traditional devotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the coming year, our reserve programs will be revised--two Army Divisions will, I hope, replace those Guard Divisions on duty--and substantial other increases will boost our Air Force fighter units, the procurement of equipment, and our continental defense and warning efforts. The Nation's first serious civil defense shelter program is under way, identifying, marking, and stocking 50 million spaces; and I urge your approval of Federal incentives for the construction of public fall-out shelters in schools and hospitals and similar centers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut arms alone are not enough to keep the peace--it must be kept by men. Our instrument and our hope is the United Nations-and I see little merit in the impatience of those who would abandon this imperfect world instrument because they dislike our imperfect world. For the troubles of a world organization merely reflect the troubles of the world itself. And if the organization is weakened, these troubles can only increase. We may not always agree with every detailed action taken by every officer of the United Nations, or with every voting majority. But as an institution, it should have in the future, as it has had in the past since its inception, no stronger or more faithful member than the United States of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1961 the peace-keeping strength of the United Nations was reinforced. And those who preferred or predicted its demise, envisioning a troika in the seat of Hammarskiold--or Red China inside the Assembly-have seen instead a new vigor, under a new Secretary General and a fully independent Secretariat. In making plans for a new forum and principles on disarmament for peace-keeping in outer space--for a decade of development effort--the UN fulfilled its Charter's lofty aim.\\r\\n\\r\\nEighteen months ago the tangled and turbulent Congo presented the UN with its gravest challenge. The prospect was one of chaos--or certain big-power confrontation, with all of its hazards and all of its risks, to us and to others. Today the hopes have improved for peaceful conciliation within a united Congo. This is the objective of our policy in this important area.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo policeman is universally popular-particularly when he uses his stick to restore law and order on his beat. Those members who are willing to contribute their votes and their views--but very little else--have created a serious deficit by refusing to pay their share of special UN assessments. Yet they do pay their annual assessments to retain their votes--and a new UN Bond issue, financing special operations for the next 18 months, is to be repaid with interest from these regular assessments. This is clearly in our interest. It will not only keep the UN solvent, but require all voting members to pay their fair share of its activities. Our share of special operations has long been much higher than our share of the annual assessment--and the bond issue will in effect reduce our disproportionate obligation, and for these reasons, I am urging Congress to approve our participation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the approval of this Congress, we have undertaken in the past year a great new effort in outer space. Our aim is not simply to be first on the moon, any more than Charles Lindbergh's real aim was to be the first to Paris. His aim was to develop the techniques of our own country and other countries in the field of air and the atmosphere, and our objective in making this effort, which we hope will place one of our citizens on the moon, is to develop in a new frontier of science, commerce and cooperation, the position of the United States and the Free World.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Nation belongs among the first to explore it, and among the first--if not the first--we shall be. We are offering our know-how and our cooperation to the United Nations. Our satellites will soon be providing other nations with improved weather observations. And I shall soon send to the Congress a measure to govern the financing and operation of an International Communications Satellite system, in a manner consistent with the public interest and our foreign policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut peace in space will help us naught once peace on earth is gone. World order will be secured only when the whole world has laid down these weapons which seem to offer us present security but threaten the future survival of the human race. That armistice day seems very far away. The vast resources of this planet are being devoted more and more to the means of destroying, instead of enriching, human life.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the world was not meant to be a prison in which man awaits his execution. Nor has mankind survived the tests and trials of thousands of years to surrender everything-including its existence--now. This Nation has the will and the faith to make a supreme effort to break the log jam on disarmament and nuclear tests--and we will persist until we prevail, until the rule of law has replaced the ever dangerous use of force.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turn now to a prospect of great promise: our Hemispheric relations. The Alliance for Progress is being rapidly transformed from proposal to program. Last month in Latin America I saw for myself the quickening of hope, the revival of confidence, the new trust in our country--among workers and farmers as well as diplomats. We have pledged our help in speeding their economic, educational, and social progress. The Latin American Republics have in turn pledged a new and strenuous effort of self-help and self-reform.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo support this historic undertaking, I am proposing--under the authority contained in the bills of the last session of the Congress--a special long-term Alliance for Progress fund of $3 billion. Combined with our Food for Peace, Export-Import Bank, and other resources, this will provide more than $1 billion a year in new support for the Alliance. In addition, we have increased twelve-fold our Spanish and Portuguese language broadcasting in Latin America, .and improved Hemispheric trade and defense. And while the blight of communism has been increasingly exposed and isolated in the Americas, liberty has scored a gain. The people of the Dominican Republic, with our firm encouragement and help, and those of our sister Republics of this Hemisphere are safely passing through the treacherous course from dictatorship through disorder towards democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur efforts to help other new or developing nations, and to strengthen their stand for freedom, have also made progress. A newly unified Agency for International Development is reorienting our foreign assistance to emphasize long-term development loans instead of grants, more economic aid instead of military, individual plans to meet the individual needs of the nations, and new standards on what they must do to marshal their own resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nA newly conceived Peace Corps is winning friends and helping people in fourteen countries--supplying trained and dedicated young men and women, to give these new nations a hand in building a society, and a glimpse of the best that is in our country. If there is a problem here, it is that we cannot supply the spontaneous and mounting demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nA newly-expanded Food for Peace Pro-. gram is feeding the hungry of many lands with the abundance of our productive farms--providing lunches for children in school, wages for economic development, relief for the victims of flood and famine, and a better diet for millions whose daily bread is their chief concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese programs help people; and, by helping people, they help freedom. The views of their governments may sometimes be very different from ours--but events in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe teach us never to write off any nation as lost to the Communists- That is the lesson of our time. We support the independence of those newer or weaker states whose history, geography, economy or lack of power impels them to remain outside \\\"entangling alliances\\\"--as we did for more than a century. For the independence of nations is a bar to the Communists' \\\"grand design\\\"-it is the basis of our own.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past year, for example, we have urged a neutral and independent Laos-regained there a common policy with our major allies--and insisted that a cease-fire precede negotiations. While a workable formula for supervising its independence is still to be achieved, both the spread of war-which might have involved this country also--and a Communist occupation have thus far been prevented.\\r\\n\\r\\nA satisfactory settlement in Laos would also help to achieve and safeguard the peace in Viet-Nam--where the foe is increasing his tactics of terror--where our own efforts have been stepped up--and where the local government has initiated new programs and reforms to broaden the base of resistance. The systematic aggression now bleeding that country is not a \\\"war of liberation\\\"--for Viet-Nam is already free. It is a war of attempted subjugation--and it will be resisted.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the united strength of the Atlantic Community has flourished in the last year under severe tests. NATO has increased both the number and the readiness of its air, ground, and naval units--both its nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities. Even greater efforts by all its members are still required. Nevertheless our unity of purpose and will has been, I believe, immeasurably strengthened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe threat to the brave city of Berlin remains. In these last 6 months the Allies have made it unmistakably clear that our presence in Berlin, our free access thereto, and the freedom of two million West Berliners would not be surrendered either to force or through appeasement--and to maintain those rights and obligations, we are prepared to talk, when appropriate, and to fight, if necessary. Every member of NATO stands with us in a common commitment to preserve this symbol of free man's will to remain free.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot now predict the course of future negotiations over Berlin. I can only say that we are sparing no honorable effort to find a peaceful and mutually acceptable resolution of this problem. I believe such a resolution can be found, and with it an improvement in our relations with the Soviet Union, if only the leaders in the Kremlin will recognize the basic rights and interests involved, and the interest of all mankind in peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Atlantic Community is no longer concerned with purely military aims. As its common undertakings grow at an ever-increasing pace, we are, and increasingly will be, partners in aid, trade, defense, diplomacy, and monetary affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emergence of the new Europe is being matched by the emergence of new ties across the Atlantic. It is a matter of undramatic daily cooperation in hundreds of workaday tasks: of currencies kept in effective relation, of development loans meshed together, of standardized weapons, and concerted diplomatic positions. The Atlantic Community grows, not like a volcanic mountain, by one mighty explosion, but like a coral reef, from the accumulating activity of all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we in the free world are moving steadily toward unity and cooperation, in the teeth of that old Bolshevik prophecy, and at the very time when extraordinary rumbles of discord can be heard across the Iron Curtain. It is not free societies which bear within them the seeds of inevitable disunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn one special problem, of great concern to our friends, and to us, I am proud to give the Congress an encouraging report. Our efforts to safeguard the dollar are progressing. In the 11 months preceding last February 1, we suffered a net loss of nearly $2 billion in gold. In the 11 months that followed, the loss was just over half a billion dollars. And our deficit in our basic transactions with the rest of the world--trade, defense, foreign aid, and capital, excluding volatile short-term flows--has been reduced from $2 billion for 1960 to about one-third that amount for 1961. Speculative fever against the dollar is ending--and confidence in the dollar has been restored.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did not--and could not--achieve these gains through import restrictions, troop withdrawals, exchange controls, dollar devaluation or choking off domestic recovery. We acted not in panic but in perspective. But the problem is not yet solved. Persistently large deficits would endanger our economic growth and our military and defense commitments abroad. Our goal must be a reasonable equilibrium in our balance of payments. With the cooperation of the Congress, business, labor, and our major allies, that goal can be reached.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall continue to attract foreign tourists and investments to our shores, to seek increased military purchases here by our allies, to maximize foreign aid procurement from American firms, to urge increased aid from other fortunate nations to the less fortunate, to seek tax laws which do not favor investment in other industrialized nations or tax havens, and to urge coordination of allied fiscal and monetary policies So as to discourage large and disturbing capital movements.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove all, if we are to pay for our commitments abroad, we must expand our exports. Our businessmen must be export conscious and export competitive. Our tax policies must spur modernization of our plants--our wage and price gains must be consistent with productivity to hold the line on prices--our export credit and promotion campaigns for American industries must continue to expand.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the greatest challenge of all is posed by the growth of the European Common Market. Assuming the accession of the United Kingdom, there will arise across the Atlantic a trading partner behind a single external tariff similar to ours with an economy which nearly equals our own. Will we in this country adapt our thinking to these new prospects and patterns--or will we wait until events have passed us by?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the year to decide. The Reciprocal Trade Act is expiring. We need a new law--a wholly new approach--a bold new instrument of American trade policy. Our decision could well affect the unity of the West, the course of the Cold War, and the economic growth of our Nation for a generation to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we move decisively, our factories and farms can increase their sales to their richest, fastest-growing market. Our exports will increase. Our balance of payments position will improve. And we will have forged across the Atlantic a trading partnership with vast resources for freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, on the other hand, we hang back in deference to local economic pressures, we will find ourselves cut off from our major allies. Industries--and I believe this is most vital--industries will move their plants and jobs and capital inside the walls of the Common Market, and jobs, therefore, will be lost here in the United States if they cannot otherwise compete for its consumers. Our farm surpluses--our balance of trade, as you all know, to Europe, the Common Market, in farm products, is nearly three or four to one in our favor, amounting to one of the best earners of dollars in our balance of payments structure, and without entrance to this Market, without the ability to enter it, our farm surpluses will pile up in the Middle West, tobacco in the South, and other commodities, which have gone through Western Europe for 15 years. Our balance of payments position will worsen. Our consumers, will lack a wider choice of goods at lower prices. And millions of American workers-whose jobs depend on the sale or the transportation or the distribution of exports or imports, or whose jobs will be endangered by the movement of our capital to Europe, or whose jobs can be maintained only in. an expanding economy--these millions of workers in your home States and mine will see their real interests sacrificed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of the Congress: The United States did not rise to greatness by waiting for others to lead. This Nation is the world's foremost manufacturer, farmer, banker, consumer, and exporter. The Common Market is moving ahead at an economic growth rate twice ours. The Communist economic offensive is under way. The opportunity is ours--the initiative is up to us--and I believe that 1962 is the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo seize that initiative, I shall shortly send to the Congress a new five-year Trade Expansion Action, far-reaching in scope but designed with great care to make certain that its benefits to our people far outweigh any risks. The bill will permit the gradual elimination of tariffs here in the United States and in the Common Market on those items in which we together supply 80 percent of the world's trade--mostly items in which our own ability to compete is demonstrated by the fact that we sell abroad, in these items, substantially more than we import. This step will make it possible for our major industries to compete with their counterparts in Western Europe for access to European consumers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn other goods the bill will permit a gradual reduction of duties up to 50 percent-permitting bargaining by major categories-and provide for appropriate and tested forms of assistance to firms and employees adjusting to import competition. We are not neglecting the safeguards provided by peril points, an escape clause, or the National Security Amendment. Nor are we abandoning our non-European friends or our traditional \\\"most-favored nation\\\" principle. On the contrary, the bill will provide new encouragement for their sale of tropical agricultural products, so important to our friends in Latin America, who have long depended upon the European market, who now find themselves faced with new challenges which we must join with them in overcoming.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcessions, in this bargaining, must of course be reciprocal, not unilateral. The Common Market will not fulfill its own high promise unless its outside tariff walls are low. The dangers of restriction or timidity in our own policy have counterparts for our friends in Europe. For together we face a common challenge: to enlarge the prosperity of free men everywhere--to build in partnership a new trading community in which all free nations may gain from the productive energy of free competitive effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese various elements in our foreign policy lead, as I have said, to a single goal--the goal of a peaceful world of free and independent states. This is our guide for the present and our vision for the future--a free community of nations, independent but interdependent, uniting north and south, east and west, in one great family of man, outgrowing and transcending the hates and fears that rend our age.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will not reach that goal today, or tomorrow. We may not reach it in our own lifetime. But the quest is the greatest adventure of our century. We sometimes chafe at the burden of our obligations, the complexity of our decisions, the agony of our choices. But there is no comfort or security for us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief in irresponsibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year ago, in assuming the tasks of the Presidency, I said that few generations, in all history, had been granted the role of being the great defender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger. This is our good fortune; and I welcome it now as I did a year ago. For it is the fate of this generation-of you in the Congress and of me as President--to live with a struggle we did not start, in a world we did not make. But the pressures of life are not always distributed by choice. And while no nation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation has ever been so ready to seize the burden and the glory of freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in this high endeavor, may God watch over the United States of America.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"January 11, 1962: State of the Union Address\"},{\"doc_name\":\"january-14-1963-state-union-address\",\"date\":\"1963-01-14\",\"transcript\":\"Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 88th Congress:\\r\\n\\r\\nI congratulate you all--not merely on your electoral victory but on your selected role in history. For you and I are privileged to serve the great Republic in what could be the most decisive decade in its long history. The choices we make, for good or ill, may well shape the state of the Union for generations yet to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle more than 100 weeks ago I assumed the office of President of the United States. In seeking the help of the Congress and our countrymen, I pledged no easy answers. I pledged--and asked--only toil and dedication. These the Congress and the people have given in good measure. And today, having witnessed in recent months a heightened respect for our national purpose and power--having seen the courageous calm of a united people in a perilous hour-and having observed a steady improvement in the opportunities and well-being of our citizens--I can report to you that the state of this old but youthful Union, in the 175th year of its life, is good.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the world beyond our borders, steady progress has been made in building a world of order. The people of West Berlin remain both free and secure. A settlement, though still precarious, has been reached in Laos. The spearpoint of aggression has been blunted in Viet-Nam. The end of agony may be in sight in the Congo. The doctrine of troika is dead. And, while danger continues, a deadly threat has been removed in Cuba.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt home, the recession is behind us. Well over a million more men and women are working today than were working 2 years ago. The average factory workweek is once again more than 40 hours; our industries are turning out more goods than ever before; and more than half of the manufacturing capacity that lay silent and wasted 100 weeks ago is humming with activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, both at home and abroad, there may now be a temptation to relax. For the road has been long, the burden heavy, and the pace consistently urgent.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we cannot be satisfied to rest here. This is the side of the hill, not the top. The mere absence of war is not peace. The mere absence of recession is not growth. We have made a beginning--but we have only begun.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the time has come to make the most of our gains--to translate the renewal of our national strength into the achievement of our national purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica has enjoyed 22 months of uninterrupted economic recovery. But recovery is not enough. If we are to prevail in the long run, we must expand the long-run strength of our economy. We must move along the path to a higher rate of growth and full employment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this would mean tens of billions of dollars more each year in production, profits, wages, and public revenues. It would mean an end to the persistent slack which has kept our unemployment at or above 5 percent for 61 out of the past 62 months--and an end to the growing pressures for such restrictive measures as the 35-hour week, which alone could increase hourly labor costs by as much as 14 percent, start a new wage-price spiral of inflation, and undercut our efforts to compete with other nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo achieve these greater gains, one step, above all, is essential--the enactment this year of a substantial reduction and revision in Federal income taxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor it is increasingly clear--to those in Government, business, and labor who are responsible for our economy's success--that our obsolete tax system exerts too heavy a drag on private purchasing power, profits, and employment. Designed to check inflation in earlier years, it now checks growth instead. It discourages extra effort and risk. It distorts the use of resources. It invites recurrent recessions, depresses our Federal revenues, and causes chronic budget deficits.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when the inflationary pressures of the war and the post-war years no longer threaten, and the dollar commands new respect-now, when no military crisis strains our resources--now is the time to act. We cannot afford to be timid or slow. For this is the most urgent task confronting the Congress in 1963.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an early message, I shall propose a permanent reduction in tax rates which will lower liabilities by $13.5 billion. Of this, $11 billion results from reducing individual tax rates, which now range between 20 and 91 percent, to a more sensible range of 14 to 65 percent, with a split in the present first bracket. Two and one-half billion dollars results from reducing corporate tax rates, from 52 percent--which gives the Government today a majority interest in profits-to the permanent pre-Korean level of 47 percent. This is in addition to the more than $2 billion cut in corporate tax liabilities resulting from last year's investment credit and depreciation reform.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo achieve this reduction within the limits of a manageable budgetary deficit, I urge: first, that these cuts be phased over 3 calendar years, beginning in 1963 with a cut of some $6 billion at annual rates; second, that these reductions be coupled with selected structural changes, beginning in 1964, which will broaden the tax base, end unfair or unnecessary preferences, remove or lighten certain hardships, and in the net offset some $3.5 billion of the revenue loss; and third, that budgetary receipts at the outset be increased by $1.5 billion a year, without any change in tax liabilities, by gradually shifting the tax payments of large corporations to a . more current time schedule. This combined program, by increasing the amount of our national income, will in time result in still higher Federal revenues. It is a fiscally responsible program--the surest and the soundest way of achieving in time a balanced budget in a balanced full employment economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis net reduction in tax liabilities of $10 billion will increase the purchasing power of American families and business enterprises in every tax bracket, with greatest increase going to our low-income consumers. It will, in addition, encourage the initiative and risk-taking on which our free system depends--induce more investment, production, and capacity use--help provide the 2 million new jobs we need every year--and reinforce the American principle of additional reward for additional effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not say that a measure for tax reduction and reform is the only way to achieve these goals.\\r\\n\\r\\n--No doubt a massive increase in Federal spending could also create jobs and growth-but, in today's setting, private consumers, employers, and investors should be given a full opportunity first.\\r\\n\\r\\n--No doubt a temporary tax cut could provide a spur to our economy--but a long run problem compels a long-run solution.\\r\\n\\r\\n--No doubt a reduction in either individual or corporation taxes alone would be of great help--but corporations need customers and job seekers need jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\n--No doubt tax reduction without reform would sound simpler and more attractive to many--but our growth is also hampered by a host of tax inequities and special preferences which have distorted the flow of investment.\\r\\n\\r\\n--And, finally, there are no doubt some who would prefer to put off a tax cut in the hope that ultimately an end to the cold war would make possible an equivalent cut in expenditures-but that end is not in view and to wait for it would be costly and self-defeating.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn submitting a tax program which will, of course, temporarily increase the deficit but can ultimately end it--and in recognition of the need to control expenditures--I will shortly submit a fiscal 1964 administrative budget which, while allowing for needed rises in defense, space, and fixed interest charges, holds total expenditures for all other purposes below this year's level.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis requires the reduction or postponement of many desirable programs, the absorption of a large part of last year's Federal pay raise through personnel and other economies, the termination of certain installations and projects, and the substitution in several programs of private for public credit. But I am convinced that the enactment this year of tax reduction and tax reform overshadows all other domestic problems in this Congress. For we cannot for long lead the cause of peace and freedom, if we ever cease to set the pace here at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nTax reduction alone, however, is not enough to strengthen our society, to provide opportunities for the four million Americans who are born every year, to improve the lives of 32 million Americans who live on the outskirts of poverty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quality of American life must keep pace with the quantity of American goods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, by holding down the budgetary cost of existing programs to keep within the limitations I have set, it is both possible and imperative to adopt other new measures that we cannot afford to postpone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese measures are based on a series of fundamental premises, grouped under four related headings:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, we need to strengthen our Nation by investing in our youth:\\r\\n\\r\\n--The future of any country which is dependent upon the will and wisdom of its citizens is damaged, and irreparably damaged, whenever any of its children is not educated to the full extent of his talent, from grade school through graduate school. Today, an estimated 4 out of every 10 students in the 5th grade will not even finish high school--and that is a waste we cannot afford.\\r\\n\\r\\n--In addition, there is no reason why one million young Americans, out of school and out of work, should all remain unwanted and often untrained on our city streets when their energies can be put to good use.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Finally, the overseas success of our Peace Corps volunteers, most of them young men and women carrying skills and ideas to needy people, suggests the merit of a similar corps serving our own community needs: in mental hospitals, on Indian reservations, in centers for the aged or for young delinquents, in schools for the illiterate or the handicapped. As the idealism of our youth has served world peace, so can it serve the domestic tranquility.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, we need to strengthen our Nation by safeguarding its health:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Our working men and women, instead of being forced to beg for help from public charity once they are old and ill, should start contributing now to their own retirement health program through the Social Security System.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Moreover, all our miracles of medical research will count for little if we cannot reverse the growing nationwide shortage of doctors, dentists, and nurses, and the widespread shortages of nursing homes and modern urban hospital facilities. Merely to keep the present ratio of doctors and dentists from declining any further, we must over the next 10 years increase the capacity of our medical schools by 50 percent and our dental schools by 100 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Finally, and of deep concern, I believe that the abandonment of the mentally ill and the mentally retarded to the grim mercy of custodial institutions too often inflicts on them and on their families a needless cruelty which this Nation should not endure. The incidence of mental retardation in this country is three times as high as that of Sweden, for example--and that figure can and must be reduced.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, we need to strengthen our Nation by protecting the basic rights of its citizens:\\r\\n\\r\\n--The right to competent counsel must be assured to every man accused of crime in Federal court, regardless of his means.\\r\\n\\r\\n--And the most precious and powerful right in the world, the right to vote in a free American election, must not be denied to any citizen on grounds of his race or color. I wish that all qualified Americans permitted to vote were willing to vote, but surely in this centennial year of Emancipation all those who are willing to vote should always be permitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth, we need to strengthen our Nation by making the best and the most economical use of its resources and facilities:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Our economic health depends on healthy transportation arteries; and I believe the way to a more modern, economical choice of national transportation service is through increased competition and decreased regulation. Local mass transit, faring even worse, is as essential a community service as hospitals and highways. Nearly three-fourths of our citizens live in urban areas, which occupy only 2 percent of our land-and if local transit is to survive and relieve the congestion of these cities, it needs Federal stimulation and assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Next, this Government is in the storage and stockpile business to the melancholy tune of more than $ 16 billion. We must continue to support farm income, but we should not pile more farm surpluses on top of the $7.5 billion we already own. We must maintain a stockpile of strategic materials, but the $8.5 billion we have acquired--for reasons both good and bad--is much more than we need; and we should be empowered to dispose of the excess in ways which will not cause market disruption.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Finally, our already overcrowded national parks and recreation areas will have twice as many visitors 10 years from now as they do today. If we do not plan today for the future growth of these and other great natural assets--not only parks and forests but wildlife and wilderness preserves, and water projects of all kinds--our children and their children will be poorer in every sense of the word.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are not domestic concerns alone. For upon our achievement of greater vitality and strength here at home hang our fate and future in the world: our ability to sustain and supply the security of free men and nations, our ability to command their respect for our leadership, our ability to expand our trade without threat to our balance of payments, and our ability to adjust to the changing demands of cold war competition and challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shall be judged more by what we do at home than by what we preach abroad. Nothing we could do to help the developing countries would help them half as much as a booming U.S. economy. And nothing our opponents could do to encourage their own ambitions would encourage them half as much as a chronic lagging U.S. economy. These domestic tasks do not divert energy from our security--they provide the very foundation for freedom's survival and success,\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning to the world outside, it was only a few years ago--in Southeast Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America, even outer space--that communism sought to convey the image of a unified, confident, and expanding empire, closing in on a sluggish America and a free world in disarray. But few people would hold to that picture today.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these past months we have reaffirmed the scientific and military superiority of freedom. We have doubled our efforts in space, to assure us of being first in the future. We have undertaken the most far-reaching defense improvements in the peacetime history of this country. And we have maintained the frontiers of freedom from Viet-Nam to West Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut complacency or self-congratulation can imperil our security as much as the weapons of tyranny. A moment of pause is not a promise of peace. Dangerous problems remain from Cuba to the South China Sea. The world's prognosis prescribes, in short, not a year's vacation for us, but a year of obligation and opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour special avenues of opportunity stand out: the Atlantic Alliance, the developing nations, the new Sino-Soviet difficulties, and the search for worldwide peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, how fares the grand alliance? Free Europe is entering into a new phase of its long and brilliant history. The era of colonial expansion has passed; the era of national rivalries is fading; and a new era of interdependence and unity is taking shape. Defying the old prophecies of Marx, consenting to what no conqueror could ever compel, the free nations of Europe are moving toward a unity of purpose and power and policy in every sphere of activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 17 years this movement has had our consistent support, both political and economic. Far from resenting the new Europe, we regard her as a welcome partner, not a rival. For the road to world peace and freedom is still long, and there are burdens which only full partners can share--in supporting the common defense, in expanding world trade, in aligning our balance of payments, in aiding the emergent nations, in concerting political and economic policies, and in welcoming to our common effort other industrialized nations, notably Japan, whose remarkable economic and political development of the 1950's permits it now to play on the world scene a major constructive role.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt differences of opinion will continue to get more attention than agreements on action, as Europe moves from independence to more formal interdependence. But these are honest differences among honorable associates--more real and frequent, in fact, among our Western European allies than between them and the United States. For the unity of freedom has never relied on uniformity of opinion. But the basic agreement of this alliance on fundamental issues continues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first task of the alliance remains the common defense. Last month Prime Minister Macmillan and I laid plans for a new stage in our long cooperative effort, one which aims to assist in the wider task of framing a common nuclear defense for the whole alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nassau agreement recognizes that the security of the West is indivisible, and so must be our defense. But it also recognizes that this is an alliance of proud and sovereign nations, and works best when we do not forget it. It recognizes further that the nuclear defense of the West is not a matter for the present nuclear powers alone--that France will be such a power in the future--and that ways must be found without increasing the hazards of nuclear diffusion, to increase the role of our other partners in planning, manning, and directing a truly multilateral nuclear force within an increasingly intimate NATO alliance. Finally, the Nassau agreement recognizes that nuclear defense is not enough, that the agreed NATO levels of conventional strength must be met, and that the alliance cannot afford to be in a position of having to answer every threat with nuclear weapons or nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe remain too near the Nassau decisions, and too far from their full realization, to know their place in history. But I believe that, for the first time, the door is open for the nuclear defense of the alliance to become a source of confidence, instead of a cause of contention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next most pressing concern of the alliance is our common economic goals of trade and growth. This Nation continues to be concerned about its balance-of-payments deficit, which, despite its decline, remains a stubborn and troublesome problem. We believe, moreover, that closer economic ties among all free nations are essential to prosperity and peace. And neither we nor the members of the European Common Market are so affluent that we can long afford to shelter high cost farms or factories from the winds of foreign competition, or to restrict the channels of trade with other nations of the free world. If the Common Market should move toward protectionism and restrictionism, it would undermine its, own basic principles. This Government means to use the authority conferred on it last year by the Congress to encourage trade expansion on both sides of the Atlantic and around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, what of the developing and nonaligned nations? They were shocked by the Soviets' sudden and secret attempt to transform Cuba into a nuclear striking base-and by Communist China's arrogant invasion of India. They have been reassured by our prompt assistance to India, by our support through the United Nations of the Congo's unification, by our patient search for disarmament, and by the improvement in our treatment of citizens and visitors whose skins do not happen to be white. And as the older colonialism recedes, and the neocolonialism of the Communist powers stands out more starkly than ever, they realize more clearly that the issue in the world struggle is not communism versus capitalism, but coercion versus free choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are beginning to realize that the longing for independence is the same the world over, whether it is the independence of West Berlin or Viet-Nam. They are beginning to realize that such independence runs athwart all Communist ambitions but is in keeping with our own--and that our approach to their diverse needs is resilient and resourceful, while the Communists are still relying on ancient doctrines and dogmas.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless it is hard for any nation to focus on an external or subversive threat to its independence when its energies are drained in daily combat with the forces of poverty and despair. It makes little sense for us to assail, in speeches and resolutions, the horrors of communism, to spend $50 billion a year to prevent its military advance-and then to begrudge spending, largely on American products, less than one-tenth of that amount to help other nations strengthen their independence and cure the social chaos in which communism always has thrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am proud--and I think most Americans are proud--of a mutual defense and assistance program, evolved with bipartisan support in three administrations, which has, with all its recognized problems, contributed to the fact that not a single one of the nearly fifty U.N. members to gain independence since the Second World War has succumbed to Communist control.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am proud of a program that has helped to arm and feed and clothe millions of people who live on the front lines of freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am especially proud that this country has put forward for the 60's a vast cooperative effort to achieve economic growth and social progress throughout the Americas-the Alliance for Progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not underestimate the difficulties that we face in this mutual effort among our close neighbors, but the free states of this hemisphere, working in close collaboration, have begun to make this alliance a living reality. Today it is feeding one out of every four school age children in Latin America an extra food ration from our farm surplus. It has distributed 1.5 million school books and is building 17,000 classrooms. It has helped resettle tens of thousands of farm families on land they can call their own. It is stimulating our good neighbors to more self-help and self-reform--fiscal, social, institutional, and land reforms. It is bringing new housing and hope, new health and dignity, to millions who were forgotten. The men and women of this hemisphere know that the alliance cannot Succeed if it is only another name for United States handouts--that it can succeed only as the Latin American nations themselves devote their best effort to fulfilling its goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis story is the same in Africa, in the Middle East, and in Asia. Wherever nations are willing to help themselves, we stand ready to help them build new bulwarks of freedom. We are not purchasing votes for the cold war; we have gone to the aid of imperiled nations, neutrals and allies alike. What we do ask--and all that we ask--is that our help be used to best advantage, and that their own efforts not be diverted by needless quarrels with other independent nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite all its past achievements, the continued progress of the mutual assistance program requires a persistent discontent with present performance. We have been reorganizing this program to make it a more effective, efficient instrument--and that process will continue this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut free world development will still be an uphill struggle. Government aid can only supplement the role of private investment, trade expansion, commodity stabilization, and, above all, internal self-improvement. The processes of growth are gradual--bearing fruit in a decade, not a day. Our successes will be neither quick nor dramatic. But if these programs were ever to be ended, our failures in a dozen countries would be sudden and certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither money nor technical assistance, however, can be our only weapon against poverty. In the end, the crucial effort is one of purpose, requiring the fuel of finance but also a torch of idealism. And nothing carries the spirit of this American idealism more effectively to the far corners of the earth than the American Peace Corps.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year ago, less than 900 Peace Corps volunteers were on the job. A year from now they will number more than 9,000-men and women, aged 18 to 79, willing to give 2 years of their lives to helping people in other lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are, in fact, nearly a million Americans serving their country and the cause of freedom in overseas posts, a record no other people can match. Surely those of us who stay at home should be glad to help indirectly; by supporting our aid programs; .by opening our doors to foreign visitors and diplomats and students; and by proving, day by day, by deed as well as word, that we are a just and generous people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, what comfort can we take from the increasing strains and tensions within the Communist bloc? Here hope must be tempered with caution. For the Soviet-Chinese disagreement is over means, not ends. A dispute over how best to bury the free world is no grounds for Western rejoicing.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, while a strain is not a fracture, it is clear that the forces of diversity are at work inside the Communist camp, despite all the iron disciplines of regimentation and all the iron dogmatism's of ideology. Marx is proven wrong once again: for it is the closed Communist societies, not the free and open societies which carry within themselves the seeds of internal disintegration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disarray of the Communist empire has been heightened by two other formidable forces. One is the historical force of nationalism-and the yearning of all men to be free. The other is the gross inefficiency of their economies. For a closed society is not open to ideas of progress--and a police state finds that it cannot command the grain to grow.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew nations asked to choose between two competing systems need only compare conditions in East and West Germany, Eastern and Western Europe, North and South Viet-Nam. They need only compare the disillusionment of Communist Cuba with the promise of the Alliance for Progress. And all the world knows that no successful system builds a wall to keep its people in and freedom out--and the wall of shame dividing Berlin is a symbol of Communist failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, what can we do to move from the present pause toward enduring peace? Again I would counsel caution. I foresee no spectacular reversal in Communist methods or goals. But if all these trends and developments can persuade the Soviet Union to walk the path of peace, then let her know that all free nations will journey with her. But until that choice is made, and until the world can develop a reliable system of international security, the free peoples have no choice but to keep their arms nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis country, therefore, continues to require the best defense in the world--a defense which is suited to the sixties. This means, unfortunately, a rising defense budget-for there is no substitute for adequate defense, and no \\\"bargain basement\\\" way of achieving it. It means the expenditure of more than $15 billion this year on nuclear weapons systems alone, a sum which is about equal to the combined defense budgets of our European Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it also means improved air and missile defenses, improved civil defense, a strengthened anti-guerrilla capacity and, of prime importance, more powerful and flexible nonnuclear forces. For threats of massive retaliation may not deter piecemeal aggression-and a line of destroyers in a quarantine, or a division of well-equipped men on a border, may be more useful to our real security than the multiplication of awesome weapons beyond all rational need.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut our commitment to national safety is not a commitment to expand our military establishment indefinitely. We do not dismiss disarmament as merely an idle dream. For we believe that, in the end, it is the only way to assure the security of all without impairing the interests of any. Nor do we mistake honorable negotiation for appeasement. While we shall never weary in the defense of freedom, neither shall we ever abandon the pursuit of peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this quest, the United Nations requires our full and continued support. Its value in serving the cause of peace has been shown anew in its role in the West New Guinea settlement, in its use as a forum for the Cuban crisis, and in its task of unification in the Congo. Today the United Nations is primarily the protector of the small and the weak, and a safety valve for the strong. Tomorrow it can form the framework for a world of law--a world in which no nation dictates the destiny of another, and in which the vast resources now devoted to destructive means will serve constructive ends.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, let our adversaries choose. If they choose peaceful competition, they shall have it. If they come to realize that their ambitions cannot succeed--if they see their \\\"wars of liberation\\\" and subversion will ultimately fail--if they recognize that there is more security in accepting inspection than in permitting new nations to master the black arts of nuclear war--and if they are willing to turn their energies, as we are, to the great unfinished tasks of our own peoples--then, surely, the areas of agreement can be very wide indeed: a clear understanding about Berlin, stability in Southeast Asia, an end to nuclear testing, new checks on surprise or accidental attack, and, ultimately, general and complete disarmament.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor we seek not the worldwide victory of one nation or system but a worldwide victory of man. The modern globe is too small, its weapons are too destructive, and its disorders are too contagious to permit any other kind of victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo achieve this end, the United States will continue to spend a greater portion of its national production than any other people in the free world. For 15 years no other free nation has demanded so much of itself. Through hot wars and cold, through recession and prosperity, through the ages of the atom and outer space, the American people have never faltered and their faith has never flagged. If at times our actions seem to make life difficult for others, it is only because history has made life difficult for us all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut difficult days need not be dark. I think these are proud and memorable days in the cause of peace and freedom. We are proud, for example, of Major Rudolf Anderson who gave his life over the island of Cuba. We salute Specialist James Allen Johnson who died on the border of South Korea. We pay honor to Sergeant Gerald Pendell who was killed in Viet-Nam. They are among the many who in this century, far from home, have died for our country. Our task now, and the task of all Americans is to live up to their commitment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friends: I close on a note of hope. We are not lulled by the momentary calm of the sea or the somewhat clearer skies above. We know the turbulence that lies below, and the storms that are beyond the horizon this year. But now the winds of change appear to be blowing more strongly than ever, in the world of communism as well as our own. For 175 years we have sailed with those winds at our back, and with the tides of human freedom in our favor. We steer our ship with hope, as Thomas Jefferson said, \\\"leaving Fear astern.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nToday we still welcome those winds of change--and we have every reason to believe that our tide is running strong. With thanks to Almighty God for seeing us through a perilous passage, we ask His help anew in guiding the \\\"Good Ship Union.\\\"\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"January 14, 1963: State of the Union Address\"},{\"doc_name\":\"january-20-1961-inaugural-address\",\"date\":\"1961-01-20\",\"transcript\":\"Vice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, Reverend Clergy, fellow citizens:\\r\\nWe observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom—symbolizing an end as well as a beginning—signifying renewal as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago.\\r\\nThe world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe—the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.\\r\\nWe dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans—born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage—and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.\\r\\nLet every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\\r\\nThis much we pledge—and more.\\r\\nTo those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United, there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided, there is little we can do—for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.\\r\\nTo those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own' freedom—and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.\\r\\nTo those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required—not because the communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.\\r\\nTo our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge—to convert our good words into good deeds—in a new alliance for progress—to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty. But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers. Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. And let every other power know that this Hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house.\\r\\nTo that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support—to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective—to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak—and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.\\r\\nFinally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.\\r\\nWe dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient, beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\\r\\nBut neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course—both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war.\\r\\nSo let us begin anew—remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.\\r\\nLet both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.\\r\\nLet both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms—and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations.\\r\\nLet both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce.\\r\\nLet both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah—to \\\"undo the heavy burdens . . . (and) let the oppressed go free.\\\"\\r\\nAnd if a beach-head of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor, not a new balance of power, but a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved.\\r\\nAll this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.\\r\\nIn your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.\\r\\nNow the trumpet summons us again—not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need—not as a call to battle, though embattled we are—but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, \\\"rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation\\\"—a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself.\\r\\nCan we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?\\r\\nIn the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility—I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it—and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.\\r\\nAnd so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.\\r\\nMy fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.\\r\\nFinally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"January 20, 1961: Inaugural Address\"},{\"doc_name\":\"january-30-1961-state-union\",\"date\":\"1961-01-30\",\"transcript\":\"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of the Congress:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a pleasure to return from whence I came. You are among my oldest friends in Washington--and this House is my oldest home. It was here, more than 14 years ago, that I first took the oath of Federal office. It was here, for 14 years, that I gained both knowledge and inspiration from members of both parties in both Houses--from your wise and generous leaders--and from the pronouncements which I can vividly recall, sitting where you now sit--including the programs of two great Presidents, the undimmed eloquence of Churchill, the soaring idealism of Nehru, the steadfast words of General de Gaulle. To speak from this same historic rostrum is a sobering experience. To be back among so many friends is a happy one.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am confident that that friendship will continue. Our Constitution wisely assigns both joint and separate roles to each branch of the government; and a President and a Congress who hold each other in mutual respect will neither permit nor attempt any trespass. For my part, I shall withhold from neither the Congress nor the people any fact or report, past, present, or future, which is necessary for an informed judgment of our conduct and hazards. I shall neither shift the burden of executive decisions to the Congress, nor avoid responsibility for the outcome of those decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI speak today in an hour of national peril and national opportunity. Before my term has ended, we shall have to test anew whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure. The outcome is by no means certain. The answers are by no means clear. All of us together--this Administration, this Congress, this nation-must forge those answers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut today, were I to offer--after little more than a week in office--detailed legislation to remedy every national ill, the Congress would rightly wonder whether the desire for speed had replaced the duty of responsibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy remarks, therefore, will be limited. But they will also be candid. To state the facts frankly is not to despair the future nor indict the past. The prudent heir takes careful inventory of his legacies, and gives a faithful accounting to those whom he owes an obligation of trust. And, while the occasion does not call for another recital of our blessings and assets, we do have no greater asset than the willingness of a free and determined people, through its elected officials, to face all problems frankly and meet all dangers free from panic or fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present state of our economy is disturbing. We take office in the wake of seven months of recession, three and one-half years of slack, seven years of diminished economic growth, and nine years of falling farm income.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness bankruptcies have reached their highest level since the Great Depression. Since 1951 farm income has been squeezed down by 25 percent. Save for a brief period in 1958, insured unemployment is at the highest peak in our history. Of some five and one-half million Americans who are without jobs, more than one million have been searching for work for more than four months. And during each month some 150,000 workers are exhausting their already meager jobless benefit rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly, one-eighth of those who are without jobs live almost without hope in nearly one hundred especially depressed and troubled areas. The rest include new school graduates unable to use their talents, farmers forced to give up their part-time jobs which helped balance their family budgets, skilled and unskilled workers laid off in such important industries as metals, machinery, automobiles and apparel.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur recovery from the 1958 recession, moreover, was anemic and incomplete. Our Gross National Product never regained its full potential. Unemployment never returned to normal levels. Maximum use of our national industrial capacity was never restored.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, the American economy is in trouble. The most resourceful industrialized country on earth ranks among the last in the rate of economic growth. Since last spring our economic growth rate has actually receded. Business investment is in a decline. Profits have fallen below predicted levels. Construction is off. A million unsold automobiles are in inventory. Fewer people are working--and the average work week has shrunk well below 40 hours. Yet prices have continued to rise--so that now too many Americans have less to spend for items that cost more to buy.\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomic prophecy is at best an uncertain art--as demonstrated by the prediction one year ago from this same podium that 1960 would be, and I quote, \\\"the most prosperous year in our history.\\\" Nevertheless, forecasts of continued slack and only slightly reduced unemployment through 1961 and 1962 have been made with alarming unanimity-and this Administration does not intend to stand helplessly by.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot afford to waste idle hours and empty plants while awaiting the end of the recession. We must show the world what a free economy can do--to reduce unemployment, to put unused capacity to work, to spur new productivity, and to foster higher economic growth within a range of sound fiscal policies and relative price stability.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will propose to the Congress within the next 14 days measures to improve unemployment compensation through temporary increases in duration on a self-supporting basis--to provide more food for the families of the unemployed, and to aid their needy children--to redevelop our areas of chronic labor surplus--to expand the services of the U.S. Employment Offices--to stimulate housing and construction--to secure more purchasing power for our lowest paid workers by raising and expanding the minimum wage--to offer tax incentives for sound plant investment--to increase the development of our natural resources--to encourage price stability--and to take other steps aimed at insuring a prompt recovery and paving the way for increased long-range growth. This is not a partisan program concentrating on our weaknesses--it is, I hope, a national program to realize our national strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nEfficient expansion at home, stimulating the new plant and technology that can make our goods more competitive, is also the key to the international balance of payments problem. Laying aside all alarmist talk and panicky solutions, let us put that knotty problem in its proper perspective.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true that, since 1958, the gap between the dollars we spend or invest abroad and the dollars returned to us has substantially widened. This overall deficit in our balance of payments increased by nearly $11 billion in the 3 years--and holders of dollars abroad converted them to gold in such a quantity as to cause a total outflow of nearly $5 billion of gold from our reserve. The 1959 deficit was caused in large part by the failure of our exports to penetrate foreign markets-the result both of restrictions on our goods and our own uncompetitive prices. The 1960 deficit, on the other hand, was more the result of an increase in private capital outflow seeking new opportunity, higher return or speculative advantage abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile this country has continued to bear more than its share of the West's military and foreign aid obligations. Under existing policies, another deficit of $2 billion is predicted for 1961--and individuals in those countries whose dollar position once depended on these deficits for improvement now wonder aloud whether our gold reserves will remain sufficient to meet our own obligations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this is cause for concern--but it is not cause for panic. For our monetary and financial position remains exceedingly strong. Including our drawing rights in the International Monetary Fund and the gold reserve held as backing for our currency and Federal Reserve deposits, we have some $22 billion in total gold stocks and other international monetary reserves available-and I now pledge that their full strength stands behind the value of the dollar for use if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, we hold large assets abroad-the total owed this nation far exceeds the claims upon our reserves--and our exports once again substantially exceed our imports.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, we need not--and we shall not-take any action to increase the dollar price of gold from $35 an ounce--to impose exchange controls--to reduce our anti-recession efforts--to fall back on restrictive trade policies--or to weaken our commitments around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Administration will not distort the value of the dollar in any fashion. And this is a commitment.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrudence and good sense do require, however, that new steps be taken to ease the payments deficit and prevent any gold crisis. Our success in world affairs has long depended in part upon foreign confidence in our ability to pay. A series of executive orders, legislative remedies and cooperative efforts with our allies will get underway immediately--aimed at attracting foreign investment and travel to this country-promoting American exports, at stable prices and with more liberal government guarantees and financing--curbing tax and customs loopholes that encourage undue spending of private dollars abroad--and (through OECD, NATO and otherwise) sharing with our allies all efforts to provide for the common defense of the free world and the hopes for growth of the less developed lands. While the current deficit lasts, ways will be found to ease our dollar outlays abroad without placing the full burden on the families of men whom we have asked to serve our Flag overseas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, whatever is required will be done to back up all our efforts abroad, and to make certain that, in the future as in the past, the dollar is as \\\"sound as a dollar.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut more than our exchange of international payments is out of balance. The current Federal budget for fiscal 1961 is almost certain to show a net deficit. The budget already submitted for fiscal 1962 will remain in balance only if the Congress enacts all the revenue measures requested--and only if an earlier and sharper up-turn in the economy than my economic advisers now think likely produces the tax revenues estimated. Nevertheless, a new Administration must of necessity build on the spending and revenue estimates already submitted. Within that framework, barring the development of urgent national defense needs or a worsening of the economy, it is my current intention to advocate a program of expenditures which, including revenues from a stimulation of the economy, will not of and by themselves unbalance the earlier Budget.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, we will do what must be done. For our national household is cluttered with unfinished and neglected tasks. Our cities are being engulfed in squalor. Twelve long years after Congress declared our goal to be \\\"a decent home and a suitable environment for every American family,\\\" we still have 25 million Americans living in substandard homes. A new housing program under a new Housing and Urban Affairs Department will be needed this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur classrooms contain 2 million more children than they can properly have room for, taught by 90,000 teachers not properly qualified to teach. One third of our most promising high school graduates are financially unable to continue the development of their talents. The war babies of the 1940's, who overcrowded our schools in the 1950's, are now descending in 1960 upon our colleges-with two college students for every one, ten years from now--and our colleges are ill prepared. We lack the scientists, the engineers and the teachers our world obligations require. We have neglected oceanography, saline water conversion, and the basic research that lies at the root of all progress. Federal grants for both higher and public school education can no longer be delayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedical research has achieved new wonders--but these wonders are too often beyond the reach of too many people, owing to a lack of income (particularly among the aged), a lack of hospital beds, a lack of nursing homes and a lack of doctors and dentists. Measures to provide health care for the aged under Social Security, and to increase the supply of both facilities and personnel, must be undertaken this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur supply of clean water is dwindling. Organized and juvenile crimes cost the taxpayers millions of dollars each year, making it essential that we have improved enforcement and new legislative safeguards. The denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow Americans on account of race--at the ballot box and elsewhere--disturbs the national conscience, and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage. Morality in private business has not been sufficiently spurred by morality in public business. A host of problems and projects in all 50 States, though not possible to include in this Message, deserves-and will receive--the attention of both the Congress and the Executive Branch. On most of these matters, Messages will be sent to the Congress within the next two weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all these problems pale when placed beside those which confront us around the world. No man entering upon this office, regardless of his party, regardless of his previous service in Washington, could fail to be staggered upon learning--even in this brief 10 day period--the harsh enormity of the trials through which we must pass in the next four years. Each day the crises multiply. Each day their solution grows more difficult. Each day we draw nearer the hour of maximum danger, as weapons spread and hostile forces grow stronger. I feel I must inform the Congress that our analyses over the last ten days make it clear that--in each of the principal areas of crisis--the tide of events has been running out and time has not been our friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Asia, the relentless pressures of the Chinese Communists menace the security of the entire area--from the borders of India and South Viet Nam to the jungles of Laos, struggling to protect its newly-won independence. We seek in Laos what we seek in all Asia, and, indeed, in all of the world-freedom for the people and independence for the government. And this Nation shall persevere in our pursuit of these objectives. In Africa, the Congo has been brutally torn by civil strife, political unrest and public disorder. We shall continue to support the heroic efforts of the United Nations to restore peace and order--efforts which are now endangered by mounting tensions, unsolved problems, and decreasing support from many member states.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Latin America, Communist agents seeking to exploit that region's peaceful revolution of hope have established a base on Cuba, only 90 miles from our shores. Our objection with Cuba is not over the people's drive for a better life. Our objection is to their domination by foreign and domestic tyrannies. Cuban social and economic reform should be encouraged. Questions of economic and trade policy can always be negotiated. But Communist domination in this Hemisphere can never be negotiated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are pledged to work with our sister republics to free the Americas of all such foreign domination and all tyranny, working toward the goal of a free hemisphere of free governments, extending from Cape Horn to the Arctic Circle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Europe our alliances are unfulfilled and in some disarray. The unity of NATO has been weakened by economic rivalry and partially eroded by national interest. It has not yet fully mobilized its resources nor fully achieved a common outlook. Yet no Atlantic power can meet on its own the mutual problems now facing us in defense, foreign aid, monetary reserves, and a host of other areas; and our close ties with those whose hopes and interests we share are among this Nation's most powerful assets.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur greatest challenge is still the world that lies beyond the Cold War--but the first great obstacle is still our relations with the Soviet Union and Communist China. We must never be lulled into believing that either power has yielded its ambitions for world domination--ambitions which they forcefully restated only a short time ago. On the contrary, our task is to convince them that aggression and subversion will not be profitable routes to pursue these ends. Open and peaceful competition--for prestige, for markets, for scientific achievement, even for men's minds--is something else again. For if Freedom and Communism were to compete for man's allegiance in a world at peace, I would look to the future with ever increasing confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo meet this array of challenges--to fulfill the role we cannot avoid on the world scene--we must reexamine and revise our whole arsenal of tools: military, economic and political.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne must not overshadow the other: On the Presidential Coat of Arms, the American eagle holds in his right talon the olive branch, while in his left he holds a bundle of arrows. We intend to give equal attention to both.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, we must strengthen our military tools. We are moving into a period of uncertain risk and great commitment in which both the military and diplomatic possibilities require a Free World force so powerful as to make any aggression clearly futile. Yet in the past, lack of a consistent, coherent military strategy, the absence of basic assumptions about our national requirements and the faulty estimates and duplication arising from inter-service rivalries have all made it difficult to assess accurately how adequate--or inadequate--our defenses really are.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have, therefore, instructed the Secretary of Defense to reappraise our entire defense strategy--our ability to fulfill our commitments-the effectiveness, vulnerability, and dispersal of our strategic bases, forces and warning systems--the efficiency and economy of our operation and organization-the elimination of obsolete bases and installations-and the adequacy, modernization and mobility of our present conventional and nuclear forces and weapons systems in the light of present and future dangers. I have asked for preliminary conclusions by the end of February--and I then shah recommend whatever legislative, budgetary or executive action is needed in the light of these conclusions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, I have asked the Defense Secretary to initiate immediately three new steps most clearly needed now:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, l have directed prompt attention to increase our air-lift capacity. Obtaining additional air transport mobility--and obtaining it now--will better assure the ability of our conventional forces to respond, with discrimination and speed, to any problem at any spot on the globe at any moment's notice. In particular it will enable us to meet any deliberate effort to avoid or divert our forces by starting limited wars in widely scattered parts of the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have directed prompt action to step up our Polaris submarine program. Using unobligated ship-building funds now (to let contracts originally scheduled for the next fiscal year) will build and place on station--at least nine months earlier than planned-substantially more units of a crucial deterrent--a fleet that will never attack first, but possess sufficient powers of retaliation, concealed beneath the seas, to discourage any aggressor from launching an attack upon our security.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have directed prompt action to accelerate our entire missile program. Until the Secretary of Defense's reappraisal is completed, the emphasis here will be largely on improved organization and decision making--on cutting down the wasteful duplications and the time-lag that have handicapped our whole family of missiles. If we are to keep the peace, we need an invulnerable missile force powerful enough to deter any aggressor from even threatening an attack that he would know could not destroy enough of our force to prevent his own destruction. For as I said upon taking the oath of office: \\\"Only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, we must improve our economic tools. Our role is essential and unavoidable in the construction of a sound and expanding economy for the entire non-communist world, helping other nations build the strength to meet their own problems, to satisfy their own aspirations--to surmount their own dangers. The problems in achieving this goal are towering and unprecedented-the response must be towering and unprecedented as well, much as Lend-Lease and the Marshall Plan were in earlier years, which brought such fruitful results.\\r\\n\\r\\nI intend to ask the Congress for authority to establish a new and more effective program for assisting the economic, educational and social development of other countries and continents. That program must stimulate and take more effectively into account the contributions of our allies, and provide central policy direction for all our own programs that now so often overlap, conflict or diffuse our energies and resources. Such a program, compared to past programs, will require\\r\\n\\r\\n--more flexibility for short run emergencies\\r\\n\\r\\n--more commitment to long term development --new attention to education at all levels --greater emphasis on the recipient nation's role, their effort, their purpose, with greater social justice for their people, broader distribution and participation by their people and more efficient public administration and more efficient tax systems of their own\\r\\n\\r\\n--and orderly planning for national and regional development instead of a piecemeal approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope the Senate will take early action approving the Convention establishing the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This will be an important instrument in sharing with our allies this development effort--working toward the time when each nation will contribute in proportion to its ability to pay. For, while we are prepared to assume our full share of these huge burdens, we cannot and must not be expected to bear them alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo our sister republics to the south, we have pledged a new alliance for progress-alianza para progreso. Our goal is a free and prosperous Latin America, realizing for all its states and all its citizens a degree of economic and social progress that matches their historic contributions of culture, intellect and liberty. To start this nation's role at this time in that alliance of neighbors, I am recommending the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n--That the Congress appropriate in full the $500 million fund pledged by the Act of Bogota, to be used not as an instrument of the Cold War, but as a first step in the sound development of the Americas.\\r\\n\\r\\n--That a new Inter-Departmental Task Force be established under the leadership of the Department of State, to coordinate at the highest level all policies and programs of concern to the Americas.\\r\\n--That our delegates to the OAS, working with those of other members, strengthen that body as an instrument to preserve the peace and to prevent foreign domination anywhere in the Hemisphere.\\r\\n\\r\\n--That, in cooperation with other nations, we launch a new hemispheric attack on illiteracy and inadequate educational opportunities to all levels; and, finally,\\r\\n\\r\\n--That a Food-for-Peace mission be sent immediately to Latin America to explore ways in which our vast food abundance can be used to help end hunger and malnutrition in certain areas of suffering in our own hemisphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Administration is expanding its Food-for-Peace Program in every possible way. The product of our abundance must be used more effectively to relieve hunger and help economic growth in all corners of the globe. And I have asked the Director of this Program to recommend additional ways in which these surpluses can advance the interests of world peace--including the establishment of world food reserves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn even more valuable national asset is our reservoir of dedicated men and women-not only on our college campuses but in every age group--who have indicated their desire to contribute their skills, their efforts, and a part of their lives to the fight for world order. We can mobilize this talent through the formation of a National Peace Corps, enlisting the services of all those with the desire and capacity to help foreign lands meet their urgent needs for trained personnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, while our attention is centered on the development of the noncommunist world, we must never forget our hopes for the ultimate freedom and welfare of the Eastern European peoples. In order to be prepared to help re-establish historic ties of friendship, I am asking the Congress for increased discretion to use economic tools in this area whenever this is found to be clearly in the national interest. This will require amendment of the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act along the lines I proposed as a member of the Senate, and upon which the Senate voted last summer. Meanwhile, I hope to explore with the Polish government the possibility of using our frozen Polish funds on projects of peace that will demonstrate our abiding friendship for and interest in the people of Poland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, we must sharpen our political and diplomatic tools the means of cooperation and agreement on which an enforceable world order must ultimately rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have already taken steps to coordinate and expand our disarmament effort--to increase our programs of research and study-and to make arms control a central goal of our national policy under my direction. The deadly arms race, and the huge resources it absorbs, have too long overshadowed all else we must do. We must prevent that arms race from spreading to new nations, to new nuclear powers and to the reaches of outer space. We must make certain that our negotiators are better informed and better prepared--to formulate workable proposals of our own and to make sound judgments about the proposals of others.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have asked the other governments concerned to agree to a reasonable delay in the talks on a nuclear test ban--and it is our intention to resume negotiations prepared to reach a final agreement with any nation that is equally willing to agree to an effective and enforceable treaty.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must increase our support of the United Nations as an instrument to end the Cold War instead of an arena in which to fight it. In recognition of its increasing importance and the doubling of its membership\\r\\n\\r\\n--we are enlarging and strengthening our own mission to the U.N.\\r\\n\\r\\n--we shall help insure that it is properly financed.\\r\\n\\r\\n--we shall work to see that the integrity of the office of the Secretary-General is maintained.\\r\\n\\r\\n--And I would address a special plea to the smaller nations of the world--to join with us in strengthening this organization, which is far more essential to their security than it is to ours--the only body in the world where no nation need be powerful to be secure, where every nation has an equal voice, and where any nation can exert influence not according to the strength of its armies but according to the strength of its ideas. It deserves the support of all.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, this Administration intends to explore promptly all possible areas of cooperation with the Soviet Union and other nations \\\"to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors.\\\" Specifically, I now invite all nations--including the Soviet Union--to join with us in developing a weather prediction program, in a new communications satellite program and in preparation for probing the distant planets of Mars and Venus, probes which may someday unlock the deepest secrets of the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday this country is ahead in the science and technology of space, while the Soviet Union is ahead in the capacity to lift large vehicles into orbit. Both nations would help themselves as well as other nations by ten moving these endeavors from the bitter and wasteful competition of the Cold War. The United States would be willing to join with the Soviet Union and the scientists of all nations in a greater effort to make the fruits of this new knowledge available to all-and, beyond that, in an effort to extend farm technology to hungry nations--to wipe out disease--to increase the exchanges of scientists and. their knowledge--and to make our own laboratories available to technicians of other lands who lack the facilities to pursue their own work. Where nature makes natural allies of us all, we can demonstrate that beneficial relations are possible even with those with whom we most deeply disagree-and this must someday be the basis of world peace and world law.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have commented on the state of the domestic economy, our balance of payments, our Federal and social budget and the state of the world. I would like to conclude with a few remarks about the state of the Executive branch. We have found it full of honest and useful public servants--but their capacity to act decisively at the exact time action is needed has too often been muffled in the morass of committees, timidities and fictitious theories which have created a growing gap between decision and execution, between planning and reality. In a time of rapidly deteriorating situations at home and abroad, this is bad for the public service and particularly bad for the country; and we mean to make a change.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have pledged myself and my colleagues in the cabinet to a continuous encouragement of initiative, responsibility and energy in serving the public interest. Let every public servant know, whether his post is high or low, that a man's rank and reputation in this Administration will be determined by the size of the job he does, and not by the size of his staff, his office or his budget. Let it be clear that this Administration recognizes the value of dissent and daring--that we greet healthy controversy as the hallmark of healthy change. Let the public service be a proud and lively career. And let every man and woman who works in any area of our national government, in any branch, at any level, be able to say with pride and with honor in future years: \\\"I served the United States government in that hour of our nation's need.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor only with complete dedication by us all to the national interest can we bring our country through the troubled years that lie ahead. Our problems are critical. The tide is unfavorable. The news will be worse before it is better. And while hoping and working for the best, we should prepare ourselves now for the worst.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot escape our dangers--neither must we let them drive us into panic or narrow isolation. In many areas of the world where the balance of power already rests with our adversaries, the forces of freedom are sharply divided. It is one of the ironies of our time that the techniques of a harsh and repressive system should be able to instill discipline and ardor in its servants--. while the blessings of liberty have too often stood for privilege, materialism and a life of case.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I have a different view of liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife in 1961 will not be easy. Wishing it, predicting it, even asking for it, will not make it so. There will be further setbacks before the tide is turned. But turn it we must. The hopes of all mankind rest upon us--not simply upon those of us in this chamber, but upon the peasant in Laos, the fisherman in Nigeria, the exile from Cuba, the spirit that moves every man and Nation who shares our hopes for freedom and the future. And in the final analysis, they rest most of all upon the pride and perseverance of our fellow citizens of the great Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the words of a great President, whose birthday we honor today, closing his final State of the Union Message sixteen years ago, \\\"We pray that we may be worthy of the unlimited opportunities that God has given us.”\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F.

But I am not here to bid farewell to Massachusetts.\\r\\nFor forty-three years—whether I was in London, Washington, the South Pacific, or elsewhere—this has been my home; and, God willing, wherever I serve this shall remain my home.\\r\\nIt was here my grandparents were born—it is here I hope my grandchildren will be born.\\r\\nI speak neither from false provincial pride nor artful political flattery. For no man about to enter high office in this country can ever be unmindful of the contribution this state has made to our national greatness.\\r\\nIts leaders have shaped our destiny long before the great republic was born. Its principles have guided our footsteps in times of crisis as well as in times of calm. Its democratic institutions—including this historic body—have served as beacon lights for other nations as well as our sister states.\\r\\nFor what Pericles said to the Athenians has long been true of this commonwealth: \\\"We do not imitate—for we are a model to others.\\\"\\r\\nAnd so it is that I carry with me from this state to that high and lonely office to which I now succeed more than fond memories of firm friendships. The enduring qualities of Massachusetts—the common threads woven by the Pilgrim and the Puritan, the fisherman and the farmer, the Yankee and the immigrant—will not be and could not be forgotten in this nation's executive mansion.\\r\\nThey are an indelible part of my life, my convictions, my view of the past, and my hopes for the future.\\r\\nAllow me to illustrate: During the last sixty days, I have been at the task of constructing an administration. It has been a long and deliberate process. Some have counseled greater speed. Others have counseled more expedient tests.\\r\\nBut I have been guided by the standard John Winthrop set before his shipmates on the flagship Arbella three hundred and thirty-one years ago, as they, too, faced the task of building a new government on a perilous frontier.\\r\\n\\\"We must always consider,\\\" he said, \\\"that we shall be as a city upon a hill—the eyes of all people are upon us.\\\"\\r\\nToday the eyes of all people are truly upon us—and our governments, in every branch, at every level, national, state and local, must be as a city upon a hill—constructed and inhabited by men aware of their great trust and their great responsibilities.\\r\\nFor we are setting out upon a voyage in 1961 no less hazardous than that undertaken by the Arabella in 1630. We are committing ourselves to tasks of statecraft no less awesome than that of governing the Massachusetts Bay Colony, beset as it was then by terror without and disorder within.\\r\\nHistory will not judge our endeavors—and a government cannot be selected—merely on the basis of color or creed or even party affiliation. Neither will competence and loyalty and stature, while essential to the utmost, suffice in times such as these.\\r\\nFor of those to whom much is given, much is required. And when at some future date the high court of history sits in judgment on each one of us—recording whether in our brief span of service we fulfilled our responsibilities to the state—our success or failure, in whatever office we may hold, will be measured by the answers to four questions:\\r\\nFirst, were we truly men of courage—with the courage to stand up to one's enemies—and the courage to stand up, when necessary, to one's associates—the courage to resist public pressure, as well as private greed?\\r\\nSecondly, were we truly men of judgment—with perceptive judgment of the future as well as the past—of our own mistakes as well as the mistakes of others—with enough wisdom to know that we did not know, and enough candor to admit it?\\r\\nThird, were we truly men of integrity—men who never ran out on either the principles in which they believed or the people who believed in them—men who believed in us—men whom neither financial gain nor political ambition could ever divert from the fulfillment of our sacred trust?\\r\\nFinally, were we truly men of dedication—with an honor mortgaged to no single individual or group, and compromised by no private obligation or aim, but devoted solely to serving the public good and the national interest.\\r\\nCourage—judgment—integrity—dedicationthese are the historic qualities of the Bay Colony and the Bay State—the qualities which this state has consistently sent to this chamber on Beacon Hill here in Boston and to Capitol Hill back in Washington.\\r\\nAnd these are the qualities which, with God's help, this son of Massachusetts hopes will characterize our government's conduct in the four stormy years that lie ahead.\\r\\nHumbly I ask His help in that undertaking—but aware that on earth His will is worked by men. I ask for your help and your prayers, as I embark on this new and solemn journey.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"January 9, 1961: \\\"City Upon a Hill\\\" Speech\"},{\"doc_name\":\"july-15-1960-acceptance-democratic-party-nomination\",\"date\":\"1960-07-15\",\"transcript\":\"Governor Stevenson, Senator Johnson, Mr. Butler, Senator Symington, Senator Humphrey, Speaker Rayburn, Fellow Democrats, I want to express my thanks to Governor Stevenson for his generous and heart-warming introduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was my great honor to place his name in nomination at the 1956 Democratic National Convention, and I am delighted to have his support and his counsel and his advice in the coming months ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a deep sense of duty and high resolve, I accept your nomination.\\r\\n\\r\\nI accept it with a full and grateful heart—without reservation—and with only one obligation—the obligation to devote every effort of body, mind and spirit to lead our party back to victory and our Nation back to greatness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am grateful too, that you have provided me with such an eloquent statement of our Party’s platform. Pledges which are made so eloquently are made to be kept. “The Rights of Man,”—the civil and economic rights essential to the human dignity of all men—are indeed our goal and our first principles. This is a platform on which I can run with enthusiasm and conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I am grateful, finally, that I can rely in the coming months on so many others—on a distinguished running mate who brings unity to our ticket and strength to our Platform, Lyndon Johnson—on one of the most articulate statesmen of our time, Adlai Stevenson—on a great spokesman for our needs as a Nation and a people, Stuart Symington—and on that fighting campaigner whose support I welcome, President Harry S. Truman—on my traveling companion in Wisconsin and West Virginia, Senator Hubert Humphrey. On Paul Butler, our devoted and courageous Chairman.\\r\\n\\r\\nI feel a lot safer now that they are on my side again. And I am proud of the contrast with our Republican competitors. For their ranks are apparently so thin that not one challenger has come forth with both the competence and the courage to make theirs an open convention.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am fully aware of the fact that the Democratic Party, by nominating someone of my faith, has taken on what many regard as a new and hazardous risk—new, at least since 1928. But I look at it this way: the Democratic Party has once again placed its confidence in the American people, and in their ability to render a free, fair judgement—to uphold the Constitution and my oath of office—and to reject any kind of religious pressure or obligation that might directly or indirectly interfere with my conduct of the Presidency in the national interest. My record of fourteen years supporting public education—supporting complete separation of church and state—and resisting pressure from any source on any issue should be clear by now to everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope that no American, considering the really critical issues facing this country, will waste his franchise by voting either for me or against me solely on account of my religious affiliation. It is not relevant. I want to stress, what some other political or religious leader may have said on this subject. It is not relevant what abuses may have existed in other countries or in other times. It is not relevant what pressures, if any, might conceivably be brought to bear on me. I am telling you now what you are entitled to know: that my decisions on any public policy will be my own—as an American, a Democrat and a free man.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder any circumstances, however, the victory that we seek in November will not be easy. We all know that in our hearts. We recognize the power of the forces that will be aligned against us. We know they will invoke the name of Abraham Lincoln on behalf of their candidate—despite the fact that the political career of their candidate has often served to show charity toward none and malice toward for all.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe know that it will not be easy to campaign against a man who has spoken or voted on every known side of every known issue. Mr. Nixon may feel it is his turn now, after the New Deal and the Fair Deal—but before he deals, someone had better cut the cards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat “someone” may be the millions of Americans who voted for President Eisenhower but balk at his would-be, self-appointed successor. For just as historians tell us that Richard I was not fit to fill the shoes of bold Henry II—and that Richard Cromwell was not fit to wear the mantle of his uncle—they might add in future years that Richard Nixon did not measure to the footsteps of Dwight D. Eisenhower.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps he could carry on the party policies—the policies of Nixon, Benson, Dirksen and Goldwater. But this Nation cannot afford such a luxury. Perhaps we could better afford a Coolidge following Harding. And perhaps we could afford a Pierce following Fillmore.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after Buchanan, this nation needed a Lincoln—after Taft, we needed a Wilson—after Hoover we needed Franklin Roosevelt . . . . And after eight years of drugged and fitful sleep, this nation needs strong, creative Democratic leadership in the White House.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we are not merely running against Mr. Nixon. Our task is not merely one of itemizing Republican failures. Nor is that wholly necessary. For the families forced from the farm will know how to vote without our telling them. The unemployed miners and textile workers will know how to vote. The old people without medical care—the families without a decent home—the parents of children without adequate food or schools—they all know that it’s time for a change.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I think the American people expect more from us than cries of indignation and attack. The times are too grave, the challenge too urgent, and the stakes too high—to permit the customary passions of political debate. We are not here to curse the darkness, but to light the candle that can guide us through that darkness to a safe and sane future. As Winston Churchill said on taking office some twenty years ago: if we open a quarrel between the present and the past, we shall be in danger of losing the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday our concern must be with the future. For the world is changing. The old era is ending. The old ways will not do.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbroad, the balance of power is shifting. There are new and more terrible weapons—new and uncertain nations—new pressures of population and deprivation. One-third of the world, it has been said, may be free—but one-third is the victim of cruel repression—and the other one-third is rocked by the pangs of poverty, hunger, and envy. More energy is released by the awakening of these new nations then by the fission of the atom itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Communist influence has penetrated further into Asia, stood astride in the Middle East and now festers some ninety miles off the coast of Florida. Friends have slipped into neutrality—and neutrals into hostility. As our keynoter reminded us, the President who began his career by going to Korea ends it by staying away from Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world has been close to war before—but now man, who has survived all previous threats to his existence, has taken into his mortal hands the power to exterminate the entire species some seven times over.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, at home, the changing face of the future is equally revolutionary. The New Deal and the Fair Deal were bold measures for their generations—but this is a new generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA technological revolution on the farm has led us to an output explosion—but we have not yet learned how to harness that explosion usefully, while protecting our farmers’ right to full parity income.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn urban population explosion has crowded our schools, cluttered up our suburbs, and increased the squalor of our slums.\\r\\n\\r\\nA peaceful revolution for human rights—demanding an end to racial discrimination in all parts of our community life has strained at the leashes imposed by timid executive leadership.\\r\\n\\r\\nA medical revolution has extended the life of our elder citizens without providing the dignity and security those later years deserve. And a revolution of automation finds machines replacing men in the mines and mills of America, without replacing their incomes or their training or their needs to pay the family doctor, grocer and landlord.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has also been a change—a slippage—in our intellectual and moral strength. Seven lean years of drought and famine have withered a field of ideas. Blight has descended on our regulatory agencies—and a dry rot, beginning in Washington, is seeping into every corner of America—in the payola mentality, the expense account way of life, the confusion between what is legal and what is right. Too many Americans have lost their way, their will, and their sense of historic purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a time, in short, for a new generation of leadership—new men to cope with new problems and new opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll over the world, particularly in the newer nations, young men are coming to power—men who are not bound by the traditions of the past—men who are not blinded by the old fears and hates and rivalries—young men who can cast off the old slogans and delusions and suspicions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Republican nominee-to-be, of course, is also a young man. But his approach is as old as McKinley. His party is the party of the past. His speeches are generalities from Poor Richard’s Almanac. Their platform, made up of left-over Democratic planks, has the courage of our old convictions. Their pledge is a pledge to the status quo – and today there can be no status quo.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor I stand tonight facing west on what was once the last frontier. From the lands that stretch three thousand miles behind me, the pioneers of old gave up their safety, their comfort and sometimes their own lives to build a new world here in the West. They were not the captives of their own doubts, the prisoners of their own price tags. Their motto was not “every man for himself” but “all for the common cause.” They were determined to make that new world strong and free, to overcome its hazards and its hardships, to conquer the enemies that threatened from without and within.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday some would say that those struggles are all over—that all the horizons have been explored—that all the battles have been won—that there is no longer an American frontier.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I trust that no one in this vast assemblage will agree with those sentiments. For the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won—and we stand today on the edge of a New Frontier—the frontier of the 1960's—a frontier of unknown opportunities and perils—a frontier of unfulfilled hopes and threats.\\r\\n\\r\\nWoodrow Wilson’s New Freedom promised our nation a new political and economic framework. Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal promised security and succor to those in need. But the New Frontier of which I speak is not a set of promises, it is a set of challenges. It sums up not what I intend to offer the American people, but what I intend to ask of them. It appeals to their pride, not to their pocketbook—it holds out the promise of more sacrifice instead of more security.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I tell you the New Frontier is here, whether we seek it or not. Beyond that frontier are the uncharted areas of science and space, unsolved problems of peace and war, unconquered pockets of ignorance and prejudice, unanswered questions of poverty and surplus. It would be easier to shrink back from that frontier, to look to the safe mediocrity of the past, to be lulled by good intentions and high rhetoric—and those who prefer that course should not cast their votes for me regardless of party.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I believe the times demand new invention, innovation, imagination, decision. I am asking each of you to be pioneers on that New Frontier. My call is to the young in heart, regardless of age – to all who respond to the Scriptural call: “Be strong and of good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor courage—not complacency—is our need today—leadership, not salesmanship. And the only valid test of leadership is the ability to lead, and lead vigorously. A tired nation, said David Lloyd George, is a Tory nation, and the United States today cannot afford to be either tired or Tory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere may be those who wish to hear more—more promises to this group or that—more harsh rhetoric about the men in the Kremlin—more assurances of a golden future, where taxes are always low and subsidies ever high. But my promises are in the platform you have adopted. Our ends will not be won by rhetoric and we can have faith in the future only if we have faith in ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the harsh facts of the matter are that we stand on this frontier at a turning-point in history. We must prove all over again whether this nation, or any nation so conceived, can long endure; whether our society, with its freedom of choice, its breadth of opportunity, its range of alternatives, can compete with the single-minded advance of the Communist system.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan a nation organized and governed such as ours endure? That is the real question. Have we the nerve and the will? Can we carry through in an age where we will witness not only new breakthroughs in weapons of destruction, but also a race for mastery of the sky and the rain, the ocean and the tides, the far side of space and the inside of men’s minds?\\r\\n\\r\\nAre we up to the task—are we equal to the challenge? Are we willing to match the Russian sacrifice of the present for the future, or must we sacrifice our future in order to enjoy the present?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is the question of the New Frontier. That is the choice our nation must make—a choice that lies not merely between two men or two parties, but between the public interest and private comfort—between national greatness and national decline—between the fresh air of progress and the stale, dank atmosphere of “normalcy”—between determined dedication and creeping mediocrity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll mankind waits upon our decision. A whole world looks to see what we will do. We cannot fail their trust, we cannot fail to try.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been a long road from that first snowy day in New Hampshire to this crowded convention city. Now begins another long journey, taking me into your cities and homes all over America. Give me your help, your hand, your voice, your vote. Recall with me the words of Isaiah: “They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we face the coming challenge, we too shall wait upon the Lord, and ask that he renew our strength, Then shall we be equal to the test. Then shall we not be weary. And then we shall prevail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"July 15, 1960: Acceptance of the Democratic Party Nomination\"},{\"doc_name\":\"july-25-1961-report-berlin-crisis\",\"date\":\"1961-07-25\",\"transcript\":\"Good evening:\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven weeks ago tonight I returned from Europe to report on my meeting with Premier Khrushchev and the others. His grim warnings about the future of the world, his aide memoire on Berlin, his subsequent speeches and threats which he and his agents have launched, and the increase in the Soviet military budget that he has announced, have all prompted a series of decisions by the Administration and a series of consultations with the members of the NATO organization. In Berlin, as you recall, he intends to bring to an end, through a stroke of the pen, first our legal rights to be in West Berlin-and secondly our ability to make good on our commitment to the two million free people of that city. That we cannot permit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are clear about what must be done-and we intend to do it. I want to talk frankly with you tonight about the first steps that we shall take. These actions will require sacrifice on the part of many of our citizens. More will be required in the future. They will require, from all of us, courage and perseverance in the years to come. But if we and our allies act out of strength and unity of purpose--with calm determination and steady nerves--using restraint in our words as well as our weapons. I am hopeful that both peace and freedom will be sustained.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe immediate threat to free men is in West Berlin. But that isolated outpost is not an isolated problem. The threat is worldwide. Our effort must be equally wide and strong, and not be obsessed by any single manufactured crisis. We face a challenge in Berlin, but there is also a challenge in Southeast Asia, where the borders are less guarded, the enemy harder to find, and the dangers of communism less apparent to those who have so little. We face a challenge in our own hemisphere, and indeed wherever else the freedom of human beings is at stake.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me remind you that the fortunes of war and diplomacy left the free people of West Berlin, in 1945, 110 miles behind the Iron Curtain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis map makes very dear the problem that we face. The white is West Germany-the East is the area controlled by the Soviet Union, and as you can see from the chart, West Berlin is 110 miles within the area which the Soviets now dominate-which is immediately controlled by the so-called East German regime.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are there as a result of our victory over Nazi Germany--and our basic rights to be there, deriving from that victory, include both our presence in West Berlin and the enjoyment of access across East Germany. These rights have been repeatedly confirmed and recognized in special agreements with the Soviet Union. Berlin is not a part of East Germany, but a separate territory under the control of the allied powers. Thus our rights there are clear and deep-rooted. But in addition to those rights is our commitment to sustain--and defend, if need be--the opportunity for more than two million people to determine their own future and choose their own way of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, our presence in West Berlin, and our access thereto, cannot be ended by any act of the Soviet government. The NATO shield was long ago extended to cover West Berlin--and we have given our word that an attack upon that city will be regarded as an attack upon us all.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor West Berlin lying exposed 110 miles inside East Germany, surrounded by Soviet troops and close to Soviet supply lines, has many roles. It is more than a showcase of liberty, a symbol, an island of freedom in a Communist sea. It is even more than a link with the Free World, a beacon of hope behind the Iron Curtain, an escape hatch for refugees.\\r\\n\\r\\nWest Berlin is all of that. But above all it has now become--as never before--the great testing place of Western courage and will, a focal point where our solemn commitments stretching back over the years since 1945, and Soviet ambitions now meet in basic confrontation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be a mistake for others to look upon Berlin, because of its location, as a tempting target. The United States is there; the United Kingdom and France are there; the pledge of NATO is there--and the people of Berlin are there. It is as secure, in that sense, as the rest of us--for we cannot separate its safety from our own.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hear it said that West Berlin is militarily untenable. And so was Bastogne. And so, in fact, was Stalingrad. Any dangerous spot is tenable if men--brave men--will make it so.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not want to fight--but we have fought before. And others in earlier times have made the same dangerous mistake of assuming that the West was too selfish and too soft and too divided to resist invasions of freedom in other lands. Those who threaten to unleash the forces of war on a dispute over West Berlin should recall the words of the ancient philosopher: \\\"A man who causes fear cannot be free from fear.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot and will not permit the Communists to drive us out of Berlin, either gradually or by force. For the fulfillment of our pledge to that city is essential to the morale and security of Western Germany, to the unity of Western Europe, and to the faith of the entire Free World. Soviet strategy has long been aimed, not merely at Berlin, but at dividing and neutralizing all of Europe, forcing us back on our own shores. We must meet our oft-stated pledge to the free peoples of West Berlin-and maintain our rights and their safety, even in the face of force--in order to maintain the confidence of other free peoples in our word and our resolve. The strength of the alliance on which our security depends is dependent in turn on our willingness to meet our commitments to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo long as the Communists insist that they are preparing to end by themselves unilaterally our rights in West Berlin and our commitments to its people, we must be prepared to defend those rights and those commitments. We will at all times be ready to talk, if talk will help. But we must also be ready to resist with force, if force is used upon us. Either alone would fail. Together, they can serve the cause of freedom and peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new preparations that we shall make to defend the peace are part of the long-term build-up in our strength which has been underway since January. They are based on our needs to meet a world-wide threat, on a basis which stretches far beyond the present Berlin crisis. Our primary purpose is neither propaganda nor provocation--but preparation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA first need is to hasten progress toward the military goals which the North Atlantic allies have set for themselves. In Europe today nothing less will suffice. We will put even greater resources into fulfilling those goals, and we look to our allies to do the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supplementary defense build-ups that I asked from the Congress in March and May have already started moving us toward these and our other defense goals. They included an increase in the size of the Marine Corps, improved readiness of our reserves, expansion of our air and sea lift, and stepped-up procurement of needed weapons, ammunition, and other items. To insure a continuing invulnerable capacity to deter or destroy any aggressor, they provided for the strengthening of our missile power and for putting 50% of our B-52 and B-47 bombers on a ground alert which would send them on their way with 15 minutes' warning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese measures must be speeded up, and still others must now be taken. We must have sea and air lift capable of moving our forces quickly and in large numbers to any part of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even more importantly, we need the capability of placing in any critical area at the appropriate time a force which, combined with those of our allies, is large enough to make clear our determination and our ability to defend our rights at all costs--and to meet all levels of aggressor pressure with whatever levels of force are required. We intend to have a wider choice than humiliation or all-out nuclear action. While it is unwise at this time either to call up or send abroad excessive numbers of these troops before they are needed, let me make it clear that I intend to take, as time goes on, whatever steps are necessary to make certain that such forces can be deployed at the appropriate time without lessening our ability to meet our commitments elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, in the days and months ahead, I shall not hesitate to ask the Congress for additional measures, or exercise any of the executive powers that I possess to meet this threat to peace. Everything essential to the security of freedom must be done; and if that should require more men, or more taxes, or more controls, or other new powers, I shall not hesitate to ask them. The measures proposed today will be constantly studied, and altered as necessary. But while we will not let panic shape our policy, neither will we permit timidity to direct our program.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, I am now taking the following steps:\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) I am tomorrow requesting the Congress for the current fiscal year an additional $3,247,000,000 of appropriations for the Armed Forces.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) To fill out our present Army Divisions, and to make more men available for prompt deployment, I am requesting an increase in the Army's total authorized strength from 875,000 to approximately 1 million men.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) I am requesting an increase of 29,000 and 63,000 men respectively in the active duty strength of the Navy and the Air Force.\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) To fulfill these manpower needs, I am ordering that our draft calls be doubled and tripled in the coming months; I am asking the Congress for authority to order to active duty certain ready reserve units and individual reservists, and to extend tours of duty;2 and, under that authority, I am planning to order to active duty a number of air transport squadrons and Air National Guard tactical air squadrons, to give us the airlift capacity and protection that we need. Other reserve forces will be called up when needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n(5) Many ships and planes once headed for retirement are to be retained or reactivated, increasing our airpower tactically and our sealift, airlift, and anti-submarine warfare capability. In addition, our strategic air power will be increased by delaying the deactivation of B-47 bombers.\\r\\n\\r\\n(6) Finally, some $1.8 billion--about half of the total sum--is needed for the procurement of non-nuclear weapons, ammunition and equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe details on all these requests will be presented to the Congress tomorrow. Subsequent steps will be taken to suit subsequent needs. Comparable efforts for the common defense are being discussed with our NATO allies. For their commitment and interest are as precise as our own.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let me add that I am well aware of the fact that many American families will bear the burden of these requests. Studies or careers will be interrupted; husbands and sons will be called away; incomes in some cases will be reduced. But these are burdens which must be borne if freedom is to be defended--Americans have willingly borne them before--and they will not flinch from the task now.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have another sober responsibility. To recognize the possibilities of nuclear war in the missile age, without our citizens knowing what they should do and where they should go if bombs begin to fall, would be a failure of responsibility. In May, I pledged a new start on Civil Defense. Last week, I assigned, on the recommendation of the Civil Defense Director, basic responsibility for this program to the Secretary of Defense, to make certain it is administered and coordinated with our continental defense efforts at the highest civilian level. Tomorrow, I am requesting of the Congress new funds for the following immediate objectives: to identify and mark space in existing structures--public and private--that could be used for fall-out shelters in case of attack; to stock those shelters with food, water, first-aid kits and other minimum essentials for survival; to increase their capacity; to improve our air-raid warning and fall-out detection systems, including a new household warning system which is now under development; and to take other measures that will be effective at an early date to save millions of lives if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the event of an attack, the lives of those families which are not hit in a nuclear blast and fire can still be saved--if they can be warned to take shelter and if that shelter is available. We owe that kind of insurance to our families--and to our country. In contrast to our friends in Europe, the need for this kind of protection is new to our shores. But the time to start is now. In the coming months, I hope to let every citizen know what steps he can take without delay to protect his family in case of attack. I know that you will want to do no less.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe addition of $207 million in Civil Defense appropriations brings our total new defense budget requests to $3.454 billion, and a total of $47-5 billion for the year. This is an increase in the defense budget of $6 billion since January, and has resulted in official estimates of a budget deficit of over $5 billion. The Secretary of the Treasury and other economic advisers assure me, however, that our economy has the capacity to bear this new request.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are recovering strongly from this year's recession. The increase in this last quarter of our year of our total national output was greater than that for any postwar period of initial recovery. And yet, wholesale prices are actually lower than they were during the recession, and consumer prices are only 1/4 of 1% higher than they were last October. In fact, this last quarter was the first in eight years in which our production has increased without an increase in the overall-price index. And for the first time since the fall of 1959, our gold position has improved and the dollar is more respected abroad. These gains, it should be stressed, are being accomplished with Budget deficits far smaller than those of the 1958 recession.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis improved business outlook means improved revenues; and I intend to submit to the Congress in January a budget for the next fiscal year which will be strictly in balance. Nevertheless, should an increase in taxes be needed--because of events in the next few months--to achieve that balance, or because of subsequent defense rises, those increased taxes will be requested in January.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, to help make certain that the current deficit is held to a safe level, we must keep down all expenditures not thoroughly justified in budget requests. The luxury of our current post-office deficit must be ended. Costs in military procurement will be closely scrutinized--and in this effort I welcome the cooperation of the Congress. The tax loopholes I have specified--on expense accounts, overseas income, dividends, interest, coo operatives and others--must be closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI realize that no public revenue measure is welcomed by everyone. But I am certain that every American wants to pay his fair share, and not leave the burden of defending freedom entirely to those who bear arms. For we have mortgaged our very future on this defense--and we cannot fail to meet our responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I must emphasize again that the choice is not merely between resistance and retreat, between atomic holocaust and surrender. Our peace-time military posture is traditionally defensive; but our diplomatic posture need not be. Our response to the Berlin crisis will not be merely military or negative. It will be more than merely standing firm. For we do not intend to leave it to others to choose and monopolize the forum and the framework of discussion. We do not intend to abandon our duty to mankind to seek a peaceful solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs signers of the UN Charter, we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk--and listen--with reason. If they have proposals--not demands--we shall hear them. If they seek genuine understanding-not concessions of our rights-we shall meet with them. We have previously indicated our readiness to remove any actual irritants in West Berlin, but the freedom of that city is not negotiable. We cannot negotiate with those who say \\\"What's mine is mine and what's yours is negotiable.\\\" But we are willing to consider any arrangement or treaty in Germany consistent with the maintenance of peace and freedom, and with the legitimate security interests of all nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe recognize the Soviet Union's historical concern about their security in Central and Eastern Europe, after a series of ravaging invasions, and we believe arrangements can be worked out which will help to meet those concerns, and make it possible for both security and freedom to exist in this troubled area.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor it is not the freedom of West Berlin which is \\\"abnormal\\\" in Germany today, but the situation in that entire divided country. If anyone doubts the legality of our rights in Berlin, we are ready to have it submitted to international adjudication. If anyone doubts the extent to which our presence is desired by the people of West Berlin, compared to East German feelings about their regime, we are ready to have that question submitted to a free vote in Berlin and, if possible, among all the German people. And let us hear at that time from the two and one-half million refugees who have fled the Communist regime in East Germany-voting for Western-type freedom with their feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world is not deceived by the Communist attempt to label Berlin as a hot-bed of war. There is peace in Berlin today. The source of world trouble and tension is Moscow, not Berlin. And if war begins, it will have begun in Moscow and not Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the choice of peace or war is largely theirs, not ours. It is the Soviets who have stirred up this crisis. It is they who are trying to force a change. It is they who have opposed free elections. It is they who have rejected an all-German peace treaty, and the rulings of international law. And as Americans know from our history on our own old frontier, gun battles are caused by outlaws, and not by officers of the peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, while we are ready to defend our interests, we shall also be ready to search for peace--in quiet exploratory talks--in formal or informal meetings. We do not want military considerations to dominate the thinking of either East or West. And Mr. Khrushchev may find that his invitation to other nations to join in a meaningless treaty may lead to their inviting him to join in the community of peaceful men, in abandoning the use of force, and in respecting the sanctity of agreements.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile all of these efforts go on, we must not be diverted from our total responsibilities, from other dangers, from other tasks. If new threats in Berlin or elsewhere should cause us to weaken our program of assistance to the developing nations who are also under heavy pressure from the same source, or to halt our efforts for realistic disarmament, or to disrupt or slow down our economy, or to neglect the education of our children, then those threats will surely be the most successful and least costly maneuver in Communist history. For we can afford all these efforts, and more but we cannot afford not to meet this challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the challenge is not to us alone. It is a challenge to every nation which asserts its sovereignty under a system of liberty. It is a challenge to all those who want a world of free choice. It is a special challenge to the Atlantic Community--the heartland of human freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe in the West must move together in building military strength. We must consult one another more closely than ever before. We must together design our proposals for peace, and labor together as they are pressed at the conference table. And together we must share the burdens and the risks of this effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Atlantic Community, as we know it, has been built in response to challenge: the challenge of European chaos in 1947, of the Berlin blockade in 1948, the challenge of Communist aggression in Korea in 1950. Now, standing strong and prosperous, after an unprecedented decade of progress, the Atlantic Community will not forget either its history or the principles which gave it meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solemn vow each of us gave to West Berlin in time of peace will not be broken in time of danger. If we do not meet our commitments to Berlin, where will we later stand? If we are not true to our word there, all that we have achieved in collective security, which relies on these words, will mean nothing. And if there is one path above all others to war, it is the path of weakness and disunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the endangered frontier of freedom runs through divided Berlin. We want it to remain a frontier of peace. This is the hope of every citizen of the Atlantic Community; every citizen of Eastern Europe; and, I am confident, every citizen of the Soviet Union. For I cannot believe that the Russian people--who bravely suffered enormous losses in the Second World War-would now wish to see the peace upset once more in Germany. The Soviet government alone can convert Berlin's frontier of peace into a pretext for war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steps I have indicated tonight are aimed at avoiding that war. To sum it all up: we seek peace--but we shall not surrender. That is the central meaning of this crisis, and the meaning of your government's policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith your help, and the help of other free men, this crisis can be surmounted. Freedom can prevail--and peace can endure.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would like to close with a personal word. When I ran for the Presidency of the United States, I knew that this country faced serious challenges, but I could not realize--nor could any man realize who does not bear the burdens of this office--how heavy and constant would be those burdens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree times in my life-time our country and Europe have been involved in major wars. In each case serious misjudgments were made on both sides of the intentions of others, which brought about great devastation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in the thermonuclear age, any misjudgment on either side about the intentions of the other could rain more devastation in several hours than has been wrought in all the wars of human history.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore I, as President and Commander-in-Chief, and all of us as Americans, are moving through serious days. I shall bear this responsibility under our Constitution for the next three and one-half years, but I am sure that we all, regardless of our occupations, will do our very best for our country, and for our cause. For all of us want to see our children grow up in a country at peace, and in a world where freedom endures.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know that sometimes we get impatient, we wish for some immediate action that would end our perils. But I must tell you that there is no quick and easy solution. The Communists control over a billion people, and they recognize that if we should falter, their success would be imminent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must look to long days ahead, which if we are courageous and persevering can bring us what we all desire.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these days and weeks I ask for your help, and your advice. I ask for your suggestions, when you think we could do better.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of us, I know, love our country, and we shall all do our best to serve it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn meeting my responsibilities in these coming months as President, I need your good will, and your support--and above all, your prayers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, and good night.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"July 25, 1961: Report on the Berlin Crisis\"},{\"doc_name\":\"july-26-1963-address-nuclear-test-ban-treaty\",\"date\":\"1963-07-26\",\"transcript\":\"Good evening, my fellow citizens:\\r\\nI speak to you tonight in a spirit of hope. Eighteen years ago the advent of nuclear weapons changed the course of the world as well as the war. Since that time, all mankind has been struggling to escape from the darkening prospect of mass destruction on earth. In an age when both sides have come to possess enough nuclear power to destroy the human race several times over, the world of communism and the world of free choice have been caught up in a vicious circle of conflicting ideology and interest. Each increase of tension has produced an increase of arms; each increase of arms has produced an increase of tension.\\r\\nIn these years, the United States and the Soviet Union have frequently communicated suspicion and warnings to each other, but very rarely hope. Our representatives have met at the summit and at the brink; they have met in Washington and in Moscow; in Geneva and at the United Nations. But too often these meetings have produced only darkness, discord, or disillusion.\\r\\nYesterday a shaft of light cut into the darkness. Negotiations were concluded in Moscow on a treaty to ban all nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and under water. For the first time, an agreement has been reached on bringing the forces of nuclear destruction under international control—a goal first sought in 1946 when Bernard Baruch presented a comprehensive control plan to the United Nations.\\r\\nThat plan, and many subsequent disarmament plans, large and small, have all been blocked by those opposed to international inspection. A ban on nuclear tests, however, requires on-the-spot inspection only for underground tests. This Nation now possesses a variety of techniques to detect the nuclear tests of other nations which are conducted in the air or under water, for such tests produce unmistakable signs which our modern instruments can pick up.\\r\\nThe treaty initialed yesterday, therefore, is a limited treaty which permits continued underground testing and prohibits only those tests that we ourselves can police. It requires no control posts, no onsite inspection, no international body.\\r\\nWe should also understand that it has other limits as well. Any nation which signs the treaty will have an opportunity to withdraw if it finds that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of the treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests; and no nation's right of self-defense will in any way be impaired. Nor does this treaty mean an end to the threat of nuclear war. It will not reduce nuclear stockpiles; it will not halt the production of nuclear weapons; it will not restrict their use in time of war.\\r\\nNevertheless, this limited treaty will radically reduce the nuclear testing which would otherwise be conducted on both sides; it will prohibit the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and all others who sign it, from engaging in the atmospheric tests which have so alarmed mankind; and it offers to all the world a welcome sign of hope.\\r\\nFor this is not a unilateral moratorium, but a specific and solemn legal obligation. While it will not prevent this Nation from testing underground, or from being ready to conduct atmospheric tests if the acts of others so require, it gives us a concrete opportunity to extend its coverage to other nations and later to other forms of nuclear tests.\\r\\nThis treaty is in part the product of Western patience and vigilance. We have made clear—most recently in Berlin and Cuba—our deep resolve to protect our security and our freedom against any form of aggression. We have also made clear our steadfast determination to limit the arms race. In three administrations, our soldiers and diplomats have worked together to this end, always supported by Great Britain. Prime Minister Macmillan joined with President Eisenhower in proposing a limited test ban in 1959, and again with me in 1961 and 1962.\\r\\nBut the achievement of this goal is not a victory for one side—it is a victory for mankind. It reflects no concessions either to or by the Soviet Union. It reflects simply our common recognition of the dangers in further testing.\\r\\nThis treaty is not the millennium. It will not resolve all conflicts, or cause the Communists to forego their ambitions, or eliminate the dangers of war. It will not reduce our need for arms or allies or programs of assistance to others. But it is an important first step—a step towards peace—a step towards reason—a step away from war.\\r\\nHere is what this step can mean to you and to your children and your neighbors:\\r\\nFirst, this treaty can be a step towards reduced world tension and broader areas of agreement. The Moscow talks have reached no agreement on any other subject, nor is this treaty conditioned on any other matter. Under Secretary Harriman made it clear that any nonaggression arrangements across the division in Europe would require full consultation with our allies and full attention to their interests. He also made clear our strong preference for a more comprehensive treaty banning all tests everywhere, and our ultimate hope for general and complete disarmament. The Soviet Government, however, is still unwilling to accept the inspection such goals require.\\r\\nNo one can predict with certainty, therefore, what further agreements, if any, can be built on the foundations of this one. They could include controls on preparations for surprise attack, or on numbers and type of armaments. There could be further limitations on the spread of nuclear weapons. The important point is that efforts to seek new agreements will go forward.\\r\\nBut the difficulty of predicting the next step is no reason to be reluctant about this step. Nuclear test ban negotiations have long been a symbol of East-West disagreement. If this treaty can also be a symbol—if it can symbolize the end of one era and the beginning of another—if both sides can by this treaty gain confidence and experience in peaceful collaboration—then this short and simple treaty may well become an historic mark in man's age-old pursuit of peace.\\r\\nWestern policies have long been designed to persuade the Soviet Union to renounce aggression, direct or indirect, so that their people and all people may live and let live in peace. The unlimited testing of new weapons of war cannot lead towards that end—but this treaty, if it can be followed by further progress, can clearly move in that direction.\\r\\nI do not say that a world without aggression or threats of war would be an easy world. It will bring new problems, new challenges from the Communists, new dangers of relaxing our vigilance or of mistaking their intent.\\r\\nBut those dangers pale in comparison to those of the spiraling arms race and a collision course towards war. Since the beginning of history, war has been mankind's constant companion. It has been the rule, not the exception. Even a nation as young and as peace-loving as our own has fought through eight wars. And three times in the last two years and a half I have been required to report to you as President that this Nation and the Soviet Union stood on the verge of direct military confrontation—in Laos, in Berlin, and in Cuba.\\r\\nA war today or tomorrow, if it led to nuclear war, would not be like any war in history. A full-scale nuclear exchange, lasting less than 60 minutes, with the weapons now in existence, could wipe out more than 300 million Americans, Europeans, and Russians, as well as untold numbers elsewhere. And the survivors, as Chairman Khrushchev warned the Communist Chinese, \\\"the survivors would envy the dead.\\\" For they would inherit a world so devastated by explosions and poison and fire that today we cannot even conceive of its horrors. So let us try to turn the world away from war. Let us make the most of this opportunity, and every opportunity, to reduce tension, to slow down the perilous nuclear arms race, and to check the world's slide toward final annihilation.\\r\\nSecond, this treaty can be a step towards freeing the world from the fears and dangers of radioactive fallout. Our own atmospheric tests last year were conducted under conditions which restricted such fallout to an absolute minimum. But over the years the number and the yield of weapons tested have rapidly increased and so have the radioactive hazards from such testing. Continued unrestricted testing by the nuclear powers, joined in time by other nations which may be less adept in limiting pollution, will increasingly contaminate the air that all of us must breathe.\\r\\nEven then, the number of children and grandchildren with cancer in their bones, with leukemia in their blood, or with poison in their lungs might seem statistically small to some, in comparison with natural health hazards. But this is not a natural health hazard—and it is not a statistical issue. The loss of even one human life, or the malformation of even one baby—who may be born long after we are gone—should be of concern to us all. Our children and grandchildren are not merely statistics toward which we can be indifferent.\\r\\nNor does this affect the nuclear powers alone. These tests befoul the air of all men and all nations, the committed and the uncommitted alike, without their knowledge and without their consent. That is why the continuation of atmospheric testing causes so many countries to regard all nuclear powers as equally evil; and we can hope that its prevention will enable those countries to see the world more clearly, while enabling all the world to breathe more easily.\\r\\nThird, this treaty can be a step toward preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to nations not now possessing them. During the next several years, in addition to the four current nuclear powers, a small but significant number of nations will have the intellectual, physical, and financial resources to produce both nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them. In time, it is estimated, many other nations will have either this capacity or other ways of obtaining nuclear warheads, even as missiles can be commercially purchased today.\\r\\nI ask you to stop and think for a moment what it would mean to have nuclear weapons in so many hands, in the hands of countries large and small, stable and unstable, responsible and irresponsible, scattered throughout the world. There would be no rest for anyone then, no stability, no real security, and no chance of effective disarmament. There would only be the increased chance of accidental war, and an increased necessity for the great powers to involve themselves in what otherwise would be local conflicts.\\r\\nIf only one thermonuclear bomb were to be dropped on any American, Russian, or any other city, whether it was launched by accident or design, by a madman or by an enemy, by a large nation or by a small, from any corner of the world, that one bomb could release more destructive power on the inhabitants of that one helpless city than all the bombs dropped in the Second World War.\\r\\nNeither the United States nor the Soviet Union nor the United Kingdom nor France can look forward to that day with equanimity. We have a great obligation, all four nuclear powers have a great obligation, to use whatever time remains to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, to persuade other countries not to test, transfer, acquire, possess, or produce such weapons.\\r\\nThis treaty can be the opening wedge in that campaign. It provides that none of the parties will assist other nations to test in the forbidden environments. It opens the door for further agreements on the control of nuclear weapons, and it is open for all nations to sign, for it is in the interest of all nations, and already we have heard from a number of countries who wish to join with us promptly.\\r\\nFourth and finally, this treaty can limit the nuclear arms race in ways which, on balance, will strengthen our Nation's security far more than the continuation of unrestricted testing. For in today's world, a nation's security does not always increase as its arms increase, when its adversary is doing the same, and unlimited competition in the testing and development of new types of destructive nuclear weapons will not make the world safer for either side. Under this limited treaty, on the other hand, the testing of other nations could never be sufficient to offset the ability of our strategic forces to deter or survive a nuclear attack and to penetrate and destroy an aggressor's homeland.\\r\\nWe have, and under this treaty we will continue to have, the nuclear strength that we need. It is true that the Soviets have tested nuclear weapons of a yield higher than that which we thought to be necessary, but the hundred megaton bomb of which they spoke 2 years ago does not and will not change the balance of strategic power. The United States has chosen, deliberately, to concentrate on more mobile and more efficient weapons, with lower but entirely sufficient yield, and our security is, therefore, not impaired by the treaty I am discussing.\\r\\nIt is also true, as Mr. Khrushchev would agree, that nations cannot afford in these matters to rely simply on the good faith of their adversaries. We have not, therefore, overlooked the risk of secret violations. There is at present a possibility that deep in outer space, that hundreds and thousands and millions of miles away from the earth illegal tests might go undetected. But we already have the capability to construct a system of observation that would make such tests almost impossible to conceal, and we can decide at any time whether such a system is needed in the light of the limited risk to us and the limited reward to others of violations attempted at that range. For any tests which might be conducted so far out in space, which cannot be conducted more easily and efficiently and legally underground, would necessarily be of such a magnitude that they would be extremely difficult to conceal. We can also employ new devices to check on the testing of smaller weapons in the lower atmosphere. Any violations, moreover, involves, along with the risk of detection, the end of the treaty and the worldwide consequences for the violator.\\r\\nSecret violations are possible and secret preparations for a sudden withdrawal are possible, and thus our own vigilance and strength must be maintained, as we remain ready to withdraw and to resume all forms of testing, if we must. But it would be a mistake to assume that this treaty will be quickly broken. The gains of illegal testing are obviously slight compared to their cost, and the hazard of discovery, and the nations which have initialed and will sign this treaty prefer it, in my judgment, to unrestricted testing as a matter of their own self-interests for these nations, too, and all nations, have a stake in limiting the arms race, in holding the spread of nuclear weapons, and in breathing air that is not radioactive. While it may be theoretically possible to demonstrate the risks inherent in any treaty, and such risks in this treaty are small, the far greater risks to our security are the risks of unrestricted testing, the risk of a nuclear arms race, the risk of new nuclear powers, nuclear pollution, and nuclear war.\\r\\nThis limited test ban, in our most careful judgment, is safer by far for the United States than an unlimited nuclear arms race. For all these reasons, I am hopeful that this Nation will promptly approve the limited test ban treaty. There will, of course, be debate in the country and in the Senate. The Constitution wisely requires the advice and consent of the Senate to all treaties, and that consultation has already begun. All this is as it should be. A document which may mark an historic and constructive opportunity for the world deserves an historic and constructive debate.\\r\\nIt is my hope that all of you will take part in that debate, for this treaty is for all of us. It is particularly for our children and our grandchildren, and they have no lobby here in Washington. This debate will involve military, scientific, and political experts, but it must be not left to them alone. The right and the responsibility are yours.\\r\\nIf we are to open new doorways to peace, if we are to seize this rare opportunity for progress, if we are to be as bold and farsighted in our control of weapons as we have been in their invention, then let us now show all the world on this side of the wall and the other that a strong America also stands for peace. There is no cause for complacency.\\r\\nWe have learned in times past that the spirit of one moment or place can be gone in the next. We have been disappointed more than once, and we have no illusions now that there are shortcuts on the road to peace. At many points around the globe the Communists are continuing their efforts to exploit weakness and poverty. Their concentration of nuclear and conventional arms must still be deterred.\\r\\nThe familiar contest between choice and coercion, the familiar places of danger and conflict, are all still there, in Cuba, in Southeast Asia, in Berlin, and all around the globe, still requiring all the strength and the vigilance that we can muster. Nothing could more greatly damage our cause than if we and our allies were to believe that peace has already been achieved, and that our strength and unity were no longer required.\\r\\nBut now, for the first time in many years, the path of peace may be open. No one can be certain what the future will bring. No one can say whether the time has come for an easing of the struggle. But history and our own conscience will judge us harsher if we do not now make every effort to test our hopes by action, and this is the place to begin. According to the ancient Chinese proverb, \\\"A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.\\\"\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, let us take that first step. Let us, if we can, step back from the shadows of war and seek out the way of peace. And if that journey is a thousand miles, or even more, let history record that we, in this land, at this time, took the first step.\\r\\nThank you and good night.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"July 26, 1963: Address on the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty\"},{\"doc_name\":\"june-10-1963-american-university-commencement\",\"date\":\"1963-06-10\",\"transcript\":\"President Anderson, members of the faculty, board of trustees, distinguished guests, my old colleague, Senator Bob Byrd, who has earned his degree through many years of attending night law school while I am earning mine in the next 30 minutes, ladies and gentlemen:\\r\\nIt is with great pride that I participate in this ceremony of the American University, sponsored by the Methodist Church, founded by Bishop John Fletcher Hurst, and first opened by President Woodrow Wilson in 1914. This is a young and growing university, but it has already fulfilled Bishop Hurst's enlightened hope for the study of history and public affairs in a city devoted to the making of history and to the conduct of the public's business. By sponsoring this institution of higher learning for all who wish to learn, whatever their color or their creed, the Methodists of this area and the Nation deserve the Nation's thanks, and I commend all those who are today graduating.\\r\\nProfessor Woodrow Wilson once said that every man sent out from a university should be a man of his nation as well as a man of his time, and I am confident that the men and women who carry the honor of graduating from this institution will continue to give from their lives, from their talents, a high measure of public service and public support.\\r\\n\\\"There are few earthly things more beautiful than a university,\\\" wrote John Masefield, in his tribute to English universities—and his words are equally true today. He did not refer to spires and towers, to campus greens and ivied walls. He admired the splendid beauty of the university, he said, because it was \\\"a place where those who hate ignorance may strive to know, where those who perceive truth may strive to make others see.\\\"\\r\\nI have, therefore, chosen this time and this place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived—yet it is the most important topic on earth: world peace.\\r\\nWhat kind of peace do I mean? What kind of peace do we seek? Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, the kind that enables men and nations to grow and to hope and to build a better life for their children—not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women—not merely peace in our time but peace for all time.\\r\\nI speak of peace because of the new face of war. Total war makes no sense in an age when great powers can maintain large and relatively invulnerable nuclear forces and refuse to surrender without resort to those forces. It makes no sense in an age when a single nuclear weapon contains almost ten times the explosive force delivered by all of the allied air forces in the Second World War. It makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn.\\r\\nToday the expenditure of billions of dollars every year on weapons acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need to use them is essential to keeping the peace. But surely the acquisition of such idle stockpiles—which can only destroy and never create—is not the only, much less the most efficient, means of assuring peace.\\r\\nI speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational men. I realize that the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war—and frequently the words of the pursuer fall on deaf ears. But we have no more urgent task.\\r\\nSome say that it is useless to speak of world peace or world law or world disarmament—and that it will be useless until the leaders of the Soviet Union adopt a more enlightened attitude. I hope they do. I believe we can help them do it. But I also believe that we must reexamine our own attitude—as individuals and as a Nation—for our attitude is as essential as theirs. And every graduate of this school, every thoughtful citizen who despairs of war and wishes to bring peace, should begin by looking inward—by examining his own attitude toward the possibilities of peace, toward the Soviet Union, toward the course of the cold war and toward freedom and peace here at home.\\r\\nFirst: Let us examine our attitude toward peace itself. Too many of us think it is impossible. Too many think it unreal. But that is a dangerous, defeatist belief. It leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable—that mankind is doomed—that we are gripped by forces we cannot control.\\r\\nWe need not accept that view. Our problems are manmade—therefore, they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants. No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings. Man's reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable—and we believe they can do it again.\\r\\nI am not referring to the absolute, infinite concept of universal peace and good will of which some fantasies and fanatics dream. I do not deny the value of hopes and dreams but we merely invite discouragement and incredulity by making that our only and immediate goal.\\r\\nLet us focus instead on a more practical, more attainable peace—based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions—on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interest of all concerned. There is no single, simple key to this peace—no grand or magic formula to be adopted by one or two powers. Genuine peace must be the product of many nations, the sum of many acts. It must be dynamic, not static, changing to meet the challenge of each new generation. For peace is a process—a way of solving problems.\\r\\nWith such a peace, there will still be quarrels and conflicting interests, as there are within families and nations. World peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his neighbor—it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance, submitting their disputes to a just and peaceful settlement. And history teaches us that enmities between nations, as between individuals, do not last forever. However fixed our likes and dislikes may seem, the tide of time and events will often bring surprising changes in the relations between nations and neighbors.\\r\\nSo let us persevere. Peace need not be impracticable, and war need not be inevitable. By defining our goal more clearly, by making it seem more manageable and less remote, we can help all peoples to see it, to draw hope from it, and to move irresistibly toward it.\\r\\nSecond: Let us reexamine our attitude toward the Soviet Union. It is discouraging to think that their leaders may actually believe what their propagandists write. It is discouraging to read a recent authoritative Soviet text on Military Strategy and find, on page after page, wholly baseless and incredible claims—such as the allegation that \\\"American imperialist circles are preparing to unleash different types of wars ... that there is a very real threat of a preventive war being unleashed by American imperialists against the Soviet Union ... [and that] the political aims of the American imperialists are to enslave economically and politically the European and other capitalist countries... [and] to achieve world domination ... by means of aggressive wars.\\\"\\r\\nTruly, as it was written long ago: \\\"The wicked flee when no man pursueth.\\\" Yet it is sad to read these Soviet statements—to realize the extent of the gulf between us. But it is also a warning—a warning to the American people not to fall into the same trap as the Soviets, not to see only a distorted and desperate view of the other side, not to see conflict as inevitable, accommodation as impossible, and communication as nothing more than an exchange of threats.\\r\\nNo government or social system is so evil that its people must be considered as lacking in virtue. As Americans, we find communism profoundly repugnant as a negation of personal freedom and dignity. But we can still hail the Russian people for their many achievements—in science and space, in economic and industrial growth, in culture and in acts of courage.\\r\\nAmong the many traits the peoples of our two countries have in common, none is stronger than our mutual abhorrence of war. Almost unique, among the major world powers, we have never been at war with each other. And no nation in the history of battle ever suffered more than the Soviet Union suffered in the course of the Second World War. At least 20 million lost their lives. Countless millions of homes and farms were burned or sacked. A third of the nation's territory, including nearly two thirds of its industrial base, was turned into a wasteland—a loss equivalent to the devastation of this country east of Chicago.\\r\\nToday, should total war ever break out again—no matter how—our two countries would become the primary targets. It is an ironic but accurate fact that the two strongest powers are the two in the most danger of devastation. All we have built, all we have worked for, would be destroyed in the first 24 hours. And even in the cold war, which brings burdens and dangers to so many countries, including this Nation's closest allies—our two countries bear the heaviest burdens. For we are both devoting massive sums of money to weapons that could be better devoted to combating ignorance, poverty, and disease. We are both caught up in a vicious and dangerous cycle in which suspicion on one side breeds suspicion on the other, and new weapons beget counter-weapons.\\r\\nIn short, both the United States and its allies, and the Soviet Union and its allies, have a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace and in halting the arms race. Agreements to this end are in the interests of the Soviet Union as well as ours—and even the most hostile nations can be relied upon to accept and keep those treaty obligations, and only those treaty obligations, which are in their own interest.\\r\\nSo, let us not be blind to our differences—but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal.\\r\\nThird: Let us reexamine our attitude toward the cold war, remembering that we are not engaged in a debate, seeking to pile up debating points. We are not here distributing blame or pointing the finger of judgment. We must deal with the world as it is, and not as it might have been had the history of the last 18 years been different.\\r\\nWe must, therefore, persevere in the search for peace in the hope that constructive changes within the Communist bloc might bring within reach solutions which now seem beyond us. We must conduct our affairs in such a way that it becomes in the Communists' interest to agree on a genuine peace. Above all, while defending our own vital interests, nuclear powers must avert those confrontations which bring an adversary to a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war. To adopt that kind of course in the nuclear age would be evidence only of the bankruptcy of our policy—or of a collective death-wish for the world.\\r\\nTo secure these ends, America's weapons are nonprovocative, carefully controlled, designed to deter, and capable of selective use. Our military forces are committed to peace and disciplined in self-restraint. Our diplomats are instructed to avoid unnecessary irritants and purely rhetorical hostility.\\r\\nFor we can seek a relaxation of tensions without relaxing our guard. And, for our part, we do not need to use threats to prove that we are resolute. We do not need to jam foreign broadcasts out of fear our faith will be eroded. We are unwilling to impose our system on any unwilling people—but we are willing and able to engage in peaceful competition with any people on earth.\\r\\nMeanwhile, we seek to strengthen the United Nations, to help solve its financial problems, to make it a more effective instrument for peace, to develop it into a genuine world security system—a system capable of resolving disputes on the basis of law, of insuring the security of the large and the small, and of creating conditions under which arms can finally be abolished.\\r\\nAt the same time we seek to keep peace inside the non-Communist world, where many nations, all of them our friends, are divided over issues which weaken Western unity, which invite Communist intervention or which threaten to erupt into war. Our efforts in West New Guinea, in the Congo, in the Middle East, and in the Indian subcontinent, have been persistent and patient despite criticism from both sides. We have also tried to set an example for others—by seeking to adjust small but significant differences with our own closest neighbors in Mexico and in Canada.\\r\\nSpeaking of other nations, I wish to make one point clear. We are bound to many nations by alliances. Those alliances exist because our concern and theirs substantially overlap. Our commitment to defend Western Europe and West Berlin, for example, stands undiminished because of the identity of our vital interests. The United States will make no deal with the Soviet Union at the expense of other nations and other peoples, not merely because they are our partners, but also because their interests and ours converge.\\r\\nOur interests converge, however, not only in defending the frontiers of freedom, but in pursuing the paths of peace. It is our hope—and the purpose of allied policies—to convince the Soviet Union that she, too, should let each nation choose its own future, so long as that choice does not interfere with the choices of others. The Communist drive to impose their political and economic system on others is the primary cause of world tension today. For there can be no doubt that, if all nations could refrain from interfering in the self-determination of others, the peace would be much more assured.\\r\\nThis will require a new effort to achieve world law—a new context for world discussions. It will require increased understanding between the Soviets and ourselves. And increased understanding will require increased contact and communication. One step in this direction is the proposed arrangement for a direct line between Moscow and Washington, to avoid on each side the dangerous delays, misunderstandings, and misreadings of the other's actions which might occur at a time of crisis.\\r\\nWe have also been talking in Geneva about other first-step measures of arms control, designed to limit the intensity of the arms race and to reduce the risks of accidental war. Our primary long-range interest in Geneva, however, is general and complete disarmament—designed to take place by stages, permitting parallel political developments to build the new institutions of peace which would take the place of arms. The pursuit of disarmament has been an effort of this Government since the 1920's. It has been urgently sought by the past three ado ministrations. And however dim the prospects may be today, we intend to continue this effort—to continue it in order that all countries, including our own, can better grasp what the problems and possibilities of disarmament are.\\r\\nThe one major area of these negotiations where the end is in sight, yet where a fresh start is badly needed, is in a treaty to outlaw nuclear tests. The conclusion of such a treaty, so near and yet so far, would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most dangerous areas. It would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of nuclear arms. It would increase our security—it would decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguards.\\r\\nI am taking this opportunity, therefore, to announce two important decisions in this regard.\\r\\nFirst: Chairman Khrushchev, Prime Minister Macmillan, and I have agreed that highlevel discussions will shortly begin in Moscow looking toward early agreement on a comprehensive test ban treaty. Our hopes must be tempered with the caution of history—but with our hopes go the hopes of all mankind.\\r\\nSecond: To make clear our good faith and solemn convictions on the matter, I now declare that the United States does not propose to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere so long as other states do not do so. We will not be the first to resume. Such a declaration is no substitute for a formal binding treaty, but I hope it will help us achieve one. Nor would such a treaty be a substitute for disarmament, but I hope it will help us achieve it.\\r\\nFinally, my fellow Americans, let us examine our attitude toward peace and freedom here at home. The quality and spirit of our own society must justify and support our efforts abroad. We must show it in the dedication of our own lives—as many of you who are graduating today will have a unique opportunity to do, by serving without pay in the Peace Corps abroad or in the proposed National Service Corps here at home.\\r\\nBut wherever we are, we must all, in our daily lives, live up to the age-old faith that peace and freedom walk together. In too many of our cities today, the peace is not secure because freedom is incomplete.\\r\\nIt is the responsibility of the executive branch at all levels of government—local, State, and National—to provide and protect that freedom for all of our citizens by all means within their authority. It is the responsibility of the legislative branch at all levels, wherever that authority is not now adequate, to make it adequate. And it is the responsibility of all citizens in all sections of this country to respect the rights of all others and to respect the law of the land.\\r\\nAll this is not unrelated to world peace. \\\"When a man's ways please the Lord,\\\" the Scriptures tell us, \\\"he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.\\\" And is not peace, in the last analysis, basically a matter of human rights—the right to live out our lives without fear of devastation—the right to breathe air as nature provided it—the right of future generations to a healthy existence?\\r\\nWhile we proceed to safeguard our national interests, let us also safeguard human interests. And the elimination of war and arms is clearly in the interest of both. No treaty, however much it may be to the advantage of all, however tightly it may be worded, can provide absolute security against the risks of deception and evasion. But it can—if it is sufficiently effective in its enforcement and if it is sufficiently in the interests of its signers—offer far more security and far fewer risks than an unabated, uncontrolled, unpredictable arms race.\\r\\nThe United States, as the world knows, will never start a war. We do not want a war. We do not now expect a war. This generation of Americans has already had enough—more than enough—of war and hate and oppression. We shall be prepared if others wish it. We shall be alert to try to stop it. But we shall also do our part to build a world of peace where the weak are safe and the strong are just. We are not helpless before that task or hopeless of its success. Confident and unafraid, we labor on—not toward a strategy of annihilation but toward a strategy of peace.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"June 10, 1963: American University Commencement\"},{\"doc_name\":\"june-11-1962-yale-university-commencement\",\"date\":\"1962-06-11\",\"transcript\":\"President Griswold, members of the faculty, graduates and their families, ladies and gentlemen:\\r\\nLet me begin by expressing my appreciation for the very deep honor that you have conferred upon me. As General de Gaulle occasionally acknowledges America to be the daughter of Europe, so I am pleased to come to Yale, the daughter of Harvard. It might be said now that I have the best of both worlds, a Harvard education and a Yale degree.\\r\\nI am particularly glad to become a Yale man because as I think about my troubles, I find that a lot of them have come from other Yale men. Among businessmen, I have had a minor disagreement with Roger Blough, of the law school class of 1931, and I have had some complaints, too, from my friend Henry Ford, of the class of 1940. In journalism I seem to have a difference with John Hay Whitney, of the class of 1926 and sometimes I also displease Henry Luce of the class of 1920, not to mention also William F. Buckley, Jr., of the class of 1950. I even have some trouble with my Yale advisers. I get along with them, but I am not always sure how they get along with each other.\\r\\nI have the warmest feelings for Chester Bowles of the class of 1924, and for Dean Acheson of the class of 1915, and my assistant, McGeorge Bundy, of the class of 1940. But I am not 100 percent sure that these three wise and experienced Yale men wholly agree with each other on every issue.\\r\\nSo this administration which aims at peaceful cooperation among all Americans has been the victim of a certain natural pugnacity developed in this city among Yale men. Now that I, too, am a Yale man, it is time for peace. Last week at West Point, in the historic tradition of that Academy, I availed myself of the powers of Commander in Chief to remit all sentences of offending cadets. In that same spirit, and in the historic tradition of Yale, let me now offer to smoke the clay pipe of friendship with all of my brother Ells, and I hope that they may be friends not only with me but even with each other.\\r\\nIn any event, I am very glad to be here and as a new member of the club, I have been checking to see what earlier links existed between the institution of the Presidency and Yale. I found that a member of the class of 1878, William Howard Taft, served one term in the White House as preparation for becoming a member of this faculty. And a graduate of 1804, John C. Calhoun, regarded the Vice Presidency, quite naturally, as too lowly a status for a Yale alumnus and became the only man in history to ever resign that office.\\r\\nCalhoun in 1804 and Taft in 1878 graduated into a world very different from ours today. They and their contemporaries spent entire careers stretching over 40 years in grappling with a few dramatic issues on which the Nation was sharply and emotionally divided, issues that occupied the attention of a generation at a time: the national bank, the disposal of the public lands, nullification or union, freedom or slavery, gold or silver. Today these old sweeping issues very largely have disappeared. The central domestic issues of our time are more subtle and less simple. They relate not to basic clashes of philosophy or ideology but to ways and means of reaching common goals to research for sophisticated solutions to complex and obstinate issues. The world of Calhoun, the world of Taft had its own hard problems and notable challenges. But its problems are not our problems. Their age is not our age. As every past generation has had to disenthrall itself from an inheritance of truisms and stereotypes, so in our own time we must move on from the reassuring repetition of stale phrases to a new, difficult, but essential confrontation with reality.\\r\\nFor the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie—deliberate, contrived, and dishonest—but the myth—persistent, persuasive, and unrealistic. Too often we hold fast to the cliches of our forebears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.\\r\\nMythology distracts us everywhere—in government as in business, in politics as in economics, in foreign affairs as in domestic affairs. But today I want to particularly consider the myth and reality in our national economy. In recent months many have come to feel, as I do, that the dialog between the parties—between business and government, between the government and the public—is clogged by illusion and platitude and fails to reflect the true realities of contemporary American society.\\r\\nI speak of these matters here at Yale because of the self-evident truth that a great university is always enlisted against the spread of illusion and on the side of reality. No one has said it more clearly than your President Griswold: \\\"Liberal learning is both a safeguard against false ideas of freedom and a source of true ones.\\\" Your role as university men, whatever your calling, will be to increase each new generation's grasp of its duties.\\r\\nThere are three great areas of our domestic affairs in which, today, there is a danger that illusion may prevent effective action. They are, first, the question of the size and the shape of government's responsibilities; second, the question of public fiscal policy; and third, the matter of confidence, business confidence or public confidence, or simply confidence in America. I want to talk about all three, and I want to talk about them carefully and dispassionately—and I emphasize that I am concerned here not with political debate but with finding ways to separate false problems from real ones.\\r\\nIf a contest in angry argument were forced upon it, no administration could shrink from response, and history does not suggest that American Presidents are totally without resources in an engagement forced upon them because of hostility in one sector of society. But in the wider national interest, we need not partisan wrangling but common concentration on common problems. I come here to this distinguished university to ask you to join in this great task.\\r\\nLet us take first the question of the size and shape of government. The myth here is that government is big, and bad—and steadily getting bigger and worse. Obviously this myth has some excuse for existence. It is true that in recent history each new administration has spent much more money than its predecessor. Thus President Roosevelt outspent President Hoover, and with allowances for the special case of the Second World War, President Truman outspent President Roosevelt. Just to prove that this was not a partisan matter, President Eisenhower then outspent President Truman by the handsome figure of $182 billion. It is even possible, some think, that this trend may continue.\\r\\nBut does it follow from this that big government is growing relatively bigger? It does not—for the fact is for the last 15 years, the Federal Government—and also the Federal debt—and also the Federal bureaucracy—have grown less rapidly than the economy as a whole. If we leave defense and space expenditures aside, the Federal Government since the Second World War has expanded less than any other major sector of our national life—less than industry, less than commerce, less than agriculture, less than higher education, and very much less than the noise about big government.\\r\\nThe truth about big government is the truth about any other great activity—it is complex. Certainly it is true that size brings dangers—but it is also true that size can bring benefits. Here at Yale which has contributed so much to our national progress in science and medicine, it may be proper for me to mention one great and little noticed expansion of government which has brought strength to our whole society—the new role of our Federal Government as the major patron of research in science and in medicine. Few people realize that in 1961, in support of all university research in science and medicine, three dollars out of every four came from the Federal Government. I need hardly point out that this has taken place without undue enlargement of Government control—that American scientists remain second to none in their independence and in their individualism.\\r\\nI am not suggesting that Federal expenditures cannot bring some measure of control. The whole thrust of Federal expenditures in agriculture have been related by purpose and design to control, as a means of dealing with the problems created by our farmers and our growing productivity. Each sector, my point is, of activity must be approached on its own merits and in terms of specific national needs. Generalities in regard to federal expenditures, therefore, can be misleading—each case, science, urban renewal, education, agriculture, natural resources, each case must be determined on its merits if we are to profit from our unrivaled ability to combine the strength of public and private purpose.\\r\\nNext, let us turn to the problem of our fiscal policy. Here the myths are legion and the truth hard to find. But let me take as a prime example the problem of the Federal budget. We persist in measuring our federal fiscal integrity today by the conventional or administrative budget—with results which would be regarded as absurd in any business firm—in any country of Europe—or in any careful assessment of the reality of our national finances. The administrative budget has sound administrative uses. But for wider purposes it is less helpful. It omits our special trust funds and the effect that they have on our economy; it neglects changes in assets or inventories. It cannot tell a loan from a straight expenditure—and worst of all it cannot distinguish between operating expenditures and long term investments.\\r\\nThis budget, in relation to the great problems of Federal fiscal policy which are basic to our economy in 1962, is not simply irrelevant; it can be actively misleading. And yet there is a mythology that measures all of our national soundness or unsoundness on the single simple basis of this same annual administrative budget. If our Federal budget is to serve not the debate but the country, we must and will find ways of clarifying this area of discourse.\\r\\nStill in the area of fiscal policy, let me say a word about deficits. The myth persists that Federal deficits create inflation and budget surpluses prevent it. Yet sizeable budget surpluses after the war did not prevent inflation, and persistent deficits for the last several years have not upset our basic price stability. Obviously deficits are sometimes dangerous—and so are surpluses. But honest assessment plainly requires a more sophisticated view than the old and automatic cliche that deficits automatically bring inflation.\\r\\nThere are myths also about our public debt. It is widely supposed that this debt is growing at a dangerously rapid rate. In fact, both the debt per person and the debt as a proportion of our gross national product have declined sharply since the Second World War. In absolute terms the national debt since the end of World War II has increased only 8 percent, while private debt was increasing 305 percent, and the debts of State and local governments—on whom people frequently suggest we should place additional burdens—the debts of State and local governments have increased 378 percent. Moreover, debts, public and private, are neither good nor bad, in and of themselves. Borrowing can lead to over-extension and collapse—but it can also lead to expansion and strength. There is no single, simple slogan in this field that we can trust.\\r\\nFinally, I come to the problem of confidence. Confidence is a matter of myth and also a matter of truth—and this time let me take the truth of the matter first.\\r\\nIt is true—and of high importance—that the prosperity of this country depends on the assurance that all major elements within it will live up to their responsibilities. If business were to neglect its obligations to the public, if labor were blind to all public responsibility, above all, if government were to abandon its obvious—and statutory—duty of watchful concern for our economic health-if any of these things should happen, then confidence might well be weakened and the danger of stagnation would increase. This is the true issue of confidence.\\r\\nBut there is also the false issue—and its simplest form is the assertion that any and all unfavorable turns of the speculative wheel—however temporary and however plainly speculative in character—are the result of, and I quote, \\\"a lack of confidence in the national administration.\\\" This I must tell you, while comforting, is not wholly true. Worse, it obscures the reality—which is also simple. The solid ground of mutual confidence is the necessary partnership of government with all of the sectors of our society in the steady quest for economic progress.\\r\\nCorporate plans are not based on a political confidence in party leaders but on an economic confidence in the Nation's ability to invest and produce and consume. Business had full confidence in the administrations in power in 1929, 1954, 1958, and 1960—but this was not enough to prevent recession when business lacked full confidence in the economy. What matters is the capacity of the Nation as a whole to deal with its economic problems and its opportunities.\\r\\nThe stereotypes I have been discussing distract our attention and divide our effort. These stereotypes do our Nation a disservice, not just because they are exhausted and irrelevant, but above all because they are misleading—because they stand in the way of the solution of hard and complicated facts. It is not new that past debates should obscure present realities. But the damage of such a false dialogue is greater today than ever before simply because today the safety of all the world—the very future of freedom—depends as never before upon the sensible and clearheaded management of the domestic affairs of the United States.\\r\\nThe real issues of our time are rarely as dramatic as the issues of Calhoun. The differences today are usually matters of degree. And we cannot understand and attack our contemporary problems in 1962 if we are bound by traditional labels and worn-out slogans of an earlier era. But the unfortunate fact of the matter is that our rhetoric has not kept pace with the speed of social and economic change. Our political debates, our public discourse—on current domestic and economic issues—too often bear little or no relation to the actual problems the United States faces.\\r\\nWhat is at stake in our economic decisions today is not some grand warfare of rival ideologies which will sweep the country with passion but the practical management of a modern economy. What we need is not labels and cliches but more basic discussion of the sophisticated and technical questions involved in keeping a great economic machinery moving ahead.\\r\\nThe national interest lies in high employment and steady expansion of output, in stable prices, and a strong dollar. The declaration of such an objective is easy; their attainment in an intricate and interdependent economy and world is a little more difficult. To attain them, we require not some automatic response but hard thought. Let me end by suggesting a few of the real questions on our national agenda.\\r\\nFirst, how can our budget and tax policies supply adequate revenues and preserve our balance of payments position without slowing up our economic growth?\\r\\nTwo, how are we to set our interest rates and regulate the flow of money in ways which will stimulate the economy at home, without weakening the dollar abroad? Given the spectrum of our domestic and international responsibilities, what should be the mix between fiscal and monetary policy?\\r\\nLet me give several examples from my experience of the complexity of these matters and how political labels and ideological approaches are irrelevant to the solution.\\r\\nLast week, a distinguished graduate of this school, Senator Proxmire, of the class of 1938, who is ordinarily regarded as a liberal Democrat, suggested that we should follow in meeting our economic problems a stiff fiscal policy, with emphasis on budget balance and an easy monetary policy with low interest rates in order to keep our economy going. In the same week, the Bank for International Settlement in Basel, Switzerland, a conservative organization representing the central bankers of Europe suggested that the appropriate economic policy in the United States should be the very opposite; that we should follow a flexible budget policy, as in Europe, with deficits when the economy is down and a high monetary policy on interest rates, as in Europe, in order to control inflation and protect goals. Both may be right or wrong. It will depend on many different factors.\\r\\nThe point is that this is basically an administrative or executive problem in which political labels or cliches do not give us a solution.\\r\\nA well-known business journal this morning, as I journeyed to New Haven, raised the prospects that a further budget deficit would bring inflation and encourage the flow of gold. We have had several budget deficits beginning with a $12 1/2 billion deficit in 1958, and it is true that in the fall of 1960 we had a gold dollar loss running at $5 billion annually. This would seem to prove the case that a deficit produces inflation and that we lose gold, yet there was no inflation following the deficit of 1958 nor has there been inflation since then.\\r\\nOur wholesale price index since 1958 has remained completely level in spite of several deficits, because the loss of gold has been due to other reasons: price instability, relative interest rates, relative export-import balances, national security expenditures—all the rest.\\r\\nLet me give you a third and final example. At the World Bank meeting in September, a number of American bankers attending predicted to their European colleagues that because of the fiscal 1962 budget deficit, there would be a strong inflationary pressure on the dollar and a loss of gold. Their predictions of inflation were shared by many in business and helped push the market up. The recent reality of non-inflation helped bring it down. We have had no inflation because we have had other factors in our economy that have contributed to price stability.\\r\\nI do not suggest that the Government is right and they are wrong. The fact of the matter is in the Federal Reserve Board and in the administration this fall, a similar view was held by many well-informed and disinterested men that inflation was the major problem that we would face in the winter of 1962. But it was not. What I do suggest is that these problems are endlessly complicated and yet they go to the future of this country and its ability to prove to the world what we believe it must prove.\\r\\nI am suggesting that the problems of fiscal and monetary policies in the sixties as opposed to the kinds of problems we faced in the thirties demand subtle challenges for which technical answers, not political answers, must be provided. These are matters upon which government and business may and in many cases will disagree. They are certainly matters that government and business should be discussing in the most dispassionate, and careful way if we to maintain the kind of vigorous upon which our country depends.\\r\\nHow can we develop and sustain strong and stable world markets for basic commodities without unfairness to the consumer and without undue stimulus to the producer? How can we generate the buying power which can consume what we produce on our farms and in our factories? How can we take advantage of the miracles of automation with the great demand that it will put upon highly skilled labor and yet offer employment to the half million of unskilled school dropouts each year who enter the labor market, eight million of them in the 1960's?\\r\\nHow do we eradicate the barriers which separate substantial minorities of our citizens from access to education and employment on equal terms with the rest?\\r\\nHow, in sum, can we make our free economy work at full capacity—that is, provide adequate profits for enterprise, adequate wages for labor, adequate utilization of plant, and opportunity for all?\\r\\nThese are the problems that we should be talking about—that the political parties and the various groups in our country should be discussing. They cannot be solved by incantations from the forgotten past. But the example of Western Europe shows that they are capable of solution—that governments, and many of them are conservative governments, prepared to face technical problems without ideological preconceptions, can coordinate the elements of a national economy and bring about growth and prosperity—a decade of it.\\r\\nSome conversations I have heard in our own country sound like old records, long-playing, left over from the middle thirties. The debate of the thirties had its great significance and produced great results, but it took place in a different world with different needs and different tasks. It is our responsibility today to live in our own world, and to identify the needs and discharge the tasks of the 1960's.\\r\\nIf there is any current trend toward meeting present problems with old cliches, this is the moment to stop it—before it lands us all in a bog of sterile acrimony.\\r\\nDiscussion is essential; and I am hopeful that the debate of recent weeks, though up to now somewhat barren, may represent the start of a serious dialog of the kind which has led in Europe to such fruitful collaboration among all the elements of economic society and to a decade of unrivaled economic progress. But let us not engage in the wrong argument at the wrong time between the wrong people in the wrong country—while the real problems of our own time grow and multiply, fertilized by our neglect.\\r\\nNearly 150 years ago Thomas Jefferson wrote, \\\"The new circumstances under which we are placed call for new words, new phrases, and for the transfer of old words to new objects.\\\" New words, new phrases, the transfer of old words to new objects-that is truer today than it was in the time of Jefferson, because the role of this country is so vastly more significant. There is a show in England called \\\"Stop the World, I Want to Get Off.\\\" You have not chosen to exercise that option. You are part of the world and you must participate in these days of our years in the solution of the problems that pour upon us, requiring the most sophisticated and technical judgment; and as we work in consonance to meet the authentic problems of our times, we will generate a vision and an energy which will demonstrate anew to the world the superior vitality and the strength of the free society.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"June 11, 1962: Yale University Commencement\"},{\"doc_name\":\"june-11-1963-address-civil-rights\",\"date\":\"1963-06-11\",\"transcript\":\"Good evening, my fellow citizens:\\r\\nThis afternoon, following a series of threats and defiant statements, the presence of Alabama National Guardsmen was required on the University of Alabama to carry out the final and unequivocal order of the United States District Court of the Northern District of Alabama. That order called for the admission of two clearly qualified young Alabama residents who happened to have been born Negro.\\r\\nThat they were admitted peacefully on the campus is due in good measure to the conduct of the students of the University of Alabama, who met their responsibilities in a constructive way.\\r\\nI hope that every American, regardless of where he lives, will stop and examine his conscience about this and other related incidents. This Nation was founded by men of many nations and backgrounds. It was founded on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.\\r\\nToday we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the rights of all who wish to be free. And when Americans are sent to Viet-Nam or West Berlin, we do not ask for whites only. It ought to be possible, therefore, for American students of any color to attend any public institution they select without having to be backed up by troops.\\r\\nIt ought to be possible for American consumers of any color to receive equal service in places of public accommodation, such as hotels and restaurants and theaters and retail stores, without being forced to resort to demonstrations in the street, and it ought to be possible for American citizens of any color to register and to vote in a free election without interference or fear of reprisal.\\r\\nIt ought to be possible, in short, for every American to enjoy the privileges of being American without regard to his race or his color. In short, every American ought to have the right to be treated as he would wish to be treated, as one would wish his children to be treated. But this is not the case.\\r\\nThe Negro baby born in America today, regardless of the section of the Nation in which he is born, has about one-half as much chance of completing a high school as a white baby born in the same place on the same day, one-third as much chance of completing college, one-third as much chance of becoming a professional man, twice as much chance of becoming unemployed, about one-seventh as much chance of earning $10,000 a year, a life expectancy which is 7 years shorter, and the prospects of earning only half as much.\\r\\nThis is not a sectional issue. Difficulties over segregation and discrimination exist in every city, in every State of the Union, producing in many cities a rising tide of discontent that threatens the public safety. Nor is this a partisan issue. In a time of domestic crisis men of good will and generosity should be able to unite regardless of party or politics. This is not even a legal or legislative issue alone. It is better to settle these matters in the courts than on the streets, and new laws are needed at every level, but law alone cannot make men see right.\\r\\nWe are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution.\\r\\nThe heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated. If an American, because his skin is dark, cannot eat lunch in a restaurant open to the public, if he cannot send his children to the best public school available, if he cannot vote for the public officials who represent him, if, in short, he cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want, then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place? Who among us would then be content with the counsels of patience and delay?\\r\\nOne hundred years of delay have passed since President Lincoln freed the slaves, yet their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice. They are not yet freed from social and economic oppression. And this Nation, for all its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens are free.\\r\\nWe preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is a land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or cast system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes?\\r\\nNow the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.\\r\\nThe fires of frustration and discord are burning in every city, North and South, where legal remedies are not at hand. Redress is sought in the streets, in demonstrations, parades, and protests which create tensions and threaten violence and threaten lives.\\r\\nWe face, therefore, a moral crisis as a country and as a people. It cannot be met by repressive police action. It cannot be left to increased demonstrations in the streets. It cannot be quieted by token moves or talk. It is a time to act in the Congress, in your State and local legislative body and, above all, in all of our daily lives.\\r\\nIt is not enough to pin the blame on others, to say this is a problem of one section of the country or another, or deplore the fact that we face. A great change is at hand, and our task, our obligation, is to make that revolution, that change, peaceful and constructive for all.\\r\\nThose who do nothing are inviting shame as well as violence. Those who act boldly are recognizing right as well as reality.\\r\\nNext week I shall ask the Congress of the United States to act, to make a commitment it has not fully made in this century to the proposition that race has no place in American life or law. The Federal judiciary has upheld that proposition in a series of forthright cases. The executive branch has adopted that proposition in the conduct of its affairs, including the employment of Federal personnel, the use of Federal facilities, and the sale of federally financed housing.\\r\\nBut there are other necessary measures which only the Congress can provide, and they must be provided at this session. The old code of equity law under which we live commands for every wrong a remedy, but in too many communities, in too many parts of the country, wrongs are inflicted on Negro citizens and there are no remedies at law. Unless the Congress acts, their only remedy is in the street.\\r\\nI am, therefore, asking the Congress to enact legislation giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the public—hotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments.\\r\\nThis seems to me to be an elementary right. Its denial is an arbitrary indignity that no American in 1963 should have to endure, but many do.\\r\\nI have recently met with scores of business leaders urging them to take voluntary action to end this discrimination and I have been encouraged by their response, and in the last 2 weeks over 75 cities have seen progress made in desegregating these kinds of facilities. But many are unwilling to act alone, and for this reason, nationwide legislation is needed if we are to move this problem from the streets to the courts.\\r\\nI am also asking Congress to authorize the Federal Government to participate more fully in lawsuits designed to end segregation in public education. We have succeeded in persuading many districts to de-segregate voluntarily. Dozens have admitted Negroes without violence. Today a Negro is attending a State-supported institution in every one of our 50 States, but the pace is very slow.\\r\\nToo many Negro children entering segregated grade schools at the time of the Supreme Court's decision 9 years ago will enter segregated high schools this fall, having suffered a loss which can never be restored. The lack of an adequate education denies the Negro a chance to get a decent job.\\r\\nThe orderly implementation of the Supreme Court decision, therefore, cannot be left solely to those who may not have the economic resources to carry the legal action or who may be subject to harassment.\\r\\nOther features will be also requested, including greater protection for the right to vote. But legislation, I repeat, cannot solve this problem alone. It must be solved in the homes of every American in every community across our country.\\r\\nIn this respect, I want to pay tribute to those citizens North and South who have been working in their communities to make life better for all. They are acting not out of a sense of legal duty but out of a sense of human decency.\\r\\nLike our soldiers and sailors in all parts of the world they are meeting freedom's challenge on the firing line, and I salute them for their honor and their courage.\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, this is a problem which faces us all—in every city of the North as well as the South. Today there are Negroes unemployed, two or three times as many compared to whites, inadequate in education, moving into the large cities, unable to find work, young people particularly out of work without hope, denied equal rights, denied the opportunity to eat at a restaurant or lunch counter or go to a movie theater, denied the right to a decent education, denied almost today the right to attend a State university even though qualified. It seems to me that these are matters which concern us all, not merely Presidents or Congressmen or Governors, but every citizen of the United States.\\r\\nThis is one country. It has become one country because all of us and all the people who came here had an equal chance to develop their talents.\\r\\nWe cannot say to 10 percent of the population that you can't have that right; that your children can't have the chance to develop whatever talents they have; that the only way that they are going to get their rights is to go into the streets and demonstrate. I think we owe them and we owe ourselves a better country than that.\\r\\nTherefore, I am asking for your help in making it easier for us to move ahead and to provide the kind of equality of treatment which we would want ourselves; to give a chance for every child to be educated to the limit of his talents.\\r\\nAs I have said before, not every child has an equal talent or an equal ability or an equal motivation, but they should have the equal right to develop their talent and their ability and their motivation, to make something of themselves.\\r\\nWe have a right to expect that the Negro community will be responsible, will uphold the law, but they have a right to expect that the law will be fair, that the Constitution will be color blind, as Justice Harlan said at the turn of the century.\\r\\nThis is what we are talking about and this is a matter which concerns this country and what it stands for, and in meeting it I ask the support of all our citizens.\\r\\nThank you very much.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F.

And I am proud to visit the Federal Republic with your distinguished Chancellor who for so many years has committed Germany to democracy and freedom and progress, and to come here in the company of my fellow American, General Clay, who has been in this city during its great moments of crisis and will come again if ever needed.\\r\\nTwo thousand years ago the proudest boast was \\\"civis Romanus sum.\\\" Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is \\\"Ich bin ein Berliner.\\\"\\r\\nI appreciate my interpreter translating my German!\\r\\nThere are many people in the world who really don't understand, or say they don't, what is the great issue between the free world and the Communist world. Let them come to Berlin. There are some who say that communism is the wave of the future. Let them come to Berlin. And there are some who say in Europe and elsewhere we can work with the Communists. Let them come to Berlin. And there are even a few who say that it is true that communism is an evil system, but it permits us to make economic progress. Lass' sic nach Berlin kommen. Let them come to Berlin.\\r\\nFreedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect, but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us. I want to say, on behalf of my countrymen, who live many miles away on the other side of the Atlantic, who are far distant from you, that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to share with you, even from a distance, the story of the last 18 years. I know of no town, no city, that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force, and the hope and the determination of the city of West Berlin. While the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of the failures of. the Communist system, for all the world to see, we take no satisfaction in it, for it is, as your Mayor has said, an offense not only against history but an offense against humanity, separating families, dividing husbands and wives and brothers and sisters, and dividing a people who wish to be joined together.\\r\\nWhat is true of this city is true of Germany—real, lasting peace in Europe can never be assured as long as one German out of four is denied the elementary right of free men, and that is to make a free choice. In 18 years of peace and good faith, this generation of Germans has earned the right to be free, including the right to unite their families and their nation in lasting peace, with good will to all people. You live in a defended island of freedom, but your life is part of the main. So let me ask you, as I close, to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today, to the hopes of tomorrow, beyond the freedom merely of this city of Berlin, or your country of Germany, to the advance of freedom everywhere, beyond the wall to the day of peace with justice, beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind.\\r\\nFreedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free. When all are free, then we can look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one and this country and this great Continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe. When that day finally comes, as it will, the people of West Berlin can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they were in the front lines for almost two decades.\\r\\nAll free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and, therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words \\\"Ich bin ein Berliner!\\\"\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F.

Your name, Mr. Salinger, shall become more hallowed and revered than the combined memories of Generals Mitchell, Arnold, and Doolittle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My humble desire is that you convey a request from the Cadet Wing to the President. Sir, there are countless numbers of our group who are oppressed by Class 3 punishments, the bane of cadets everywhere. The President is our only hope for salvation. By granting amnesty to our oppressed brethren, he and you could end your anguish and depression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Please, sir, help us return to the ranks of the living so that we may work for the New Frontier with enthusiasm and vigor.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is signed \\\"Sincerely, Cadet Marvin B. Hopkins,\\\" who's obviously going to be a future General.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mr. Salinger wants to be honored with Generals Mitchell, Arnold, and Doolittle, I therefore take great pleasure in granting amnesty to all those who not only deserve it, but need it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is customary for speakers on these occasions to say in graduating addresses that commencement signifies the beginning instead of an end, yet this thought applies with particular force to those of you who are graduating from our Nation's service academies today, for today you receive not only your degrees, but also your commissions, and tomorrow you join with all those in the military service, in the foreign service, the civil service, and elsewhere, and one million of them serve outside our frontiers who have chosen to serve the Great Republic at a turning point in our history. You will have an opportunity to help make that history-an opportunity for a service career more varied and demanding than any that has been opened to any officer corps in the history of any country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some who might be skeptical of that assertion. They claim that the future of the Air Force is mortgaged to an obsolete weapons system, the manned aircraft, or that Air Force officers of the future will be nothing more than \\\"silent silo sitters,\\\" but nothing could be further from the truth. It is this very onrush of technology which demands an expanding role for the Nation's Air Force and Air Force officers, and which guarantees that an Air Force career in the next 40 years will be even more changing and more challenging than the careers of the last 40 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some of you will travel where no man has ever traveled before. Some of you will fly the fastest planes that have ever been built, reach the highest altitudes that man has ever gone to, and lift the heaviest payloads of any aviator in history. Some of you will hold in your hands the most awesome destructive power which any nation or any man has conceived. Some of you will work with the leaders of new nations which were not even nations a few years ago. Some of you will support guerrilla and counter-guerrilla operations that combine the newest techniques of warfare with the oldest techniques of the jungle, and some of you will help develop new planes that spread their wings in flight, detect other planes at an unheard of distance, deliver new weapons with unprecedented accuracy, and survey the ground from incredible heights as a testament to our strong faith in the future of air power and the manned airplane.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am announcing today that the United States will commit itself to an important new program in civilian aviation. Civilian aviation, long both the beneficiary and the benefactor of military aviation, is of necessity equally dynamic. Neither the economics nor the politics of international air competition permits us to stand still in this area. Today the challenging new frontier in commercial aviation and in military aviation is a frontier already crossed by the military-supersonic flight. Leading members of the administration under the chairmanship of the Vice President have been considering carefully the role to be played by the National Government in determining the economic and technical feasibility of an American commercial supersonic aircraft, and in the development of such an aircraft if it be feasible.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving reviewed their recommendations, it is my judgment that this Government should immediately commence a new program in partnership with private industry to develop at the earliest practical date the prototype of a commercially successful supersonic transport superior to that being built in any other country of the world. An open, preliminary design competition will be initiated immediately among American airframe and powerplant manufacturers with a more detailed design phase to follow. If these initial phases do not produce an aircraft capable of transporting people and goods safely, swiftly, and at prices the traveler can afford and the airlines find profitable, we shall not go further.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if we can build the best operational plane of this type--and I believe we can-then the Congress and the country should be prepared to invest the funds and effort necessary to maintain this Nation's lead in long-range aircraft, a lead we have held since the end of the Second World War, a lead we should make every responsible effort to maintain. Spurred by competition from across the Atlantic and by the productivity of our own companies, the Federal Government must pledge funds to supplement the risk capital to be contributed by private companies. It must then rely heavily on the flexibility and ingenuity of private enterprise to make the detailed decisions and to introduce successfully this new jet-age transport into worldwide service, and we are talking about a plane in the end of the 60's that will move ahead at a speed faster than Mach 2 to all corners of the globe. This commitment, I believe, is essential to a strong and forward-looking Nation, and indicates the future of the manned aircraft as we move into a missile age as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that the greatest value of all of the weapons of massive retaliation lies in their ability to deter war does not diminish their importance, nor will national security in the years ahead be achieved simply by piling up bigger bombs or burying our missiles under bigger loads of concrete. For in an imperfect world where human folly has been the rule and not the exception, the surest way to bring on the war that can never happen is to sit back and assure ourselves it will not happen. The existence of mutual nuclear deterrents cannot be shrugged off as stalemate, for our national security in a period of rapid change will depend on constant reappraisal of our present doctrines, on alertness to new developments, on imagination and resourcefulness, and new ideas. Stalemate is a static term and not one of you would be here today if you believed you were entering an outmoded service requiring only custodial duties in a period of nuclear stalemate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am impressed by the extraordinary scholastic record, unmatched by any new college or university in this country, which has been made by the students and graduates of this Academy. Four Rhodes scholarships last year, two this year, and other selected scholarships, and also your record in the graduate record examination makes the people of this country proud of this Academy and the Air Force which made it possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis country is proud of the fact that more than one out of five of your all-military faculty has a doctor's degree, and all the rest have master's degrees. This is what we need for leadership in our military services, for the Air Force officer of today and tomorrow requires the broadest kind of scholarship to understand a most complex and changing world. He requires understanding and learning unmatched in the days before World War II. Any graduate of this Academy who serves in our Armed Forces will need to know economics and history, and international affairs, and languages. You will need an appreciation of other societies, and an understanding of our own Nation's purposes and policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Norstad's leadership in NATO, General Smart's outstanding tour of duty as the senior military representative in Japan are examples of Air Force officers who use their broad talents for the benefit of our country. Many of you will have similar opportunities to represent this country in negotiations with our adversaries as well as our friends, working with international organizations, working in every way in the hundred free countries around the globe to help them maintain their freedom. Your major responsibilities, in the final analysis, will relate to military command. Some of you may be members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and participate as advisers to the President who holds office.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast October's crisis in the Caribbean amply demonstrated that military policy and power cannot and must not be separated from political and diplomatic decisions. Whatever the military motive and implications of the reckless attempt to put missiles on the island of Cuba, the political and psychological implications were equally important. We needed in October--and we had them and we shall need them in the future, and we shall have them--military commanders who are conscious of the enormous stakes in the nuclear age of every decision that they take, who are aware of the fact that there are no purely political .decisions or purely military decisions; that .every problem is a mixture of both, men who know the difference between vital interests and peripheral interests, who can maneuver military forces with judgment and precision, as well as courage and determination, and who can foresee the effects of military action on political policy. We need men, in short, who can cope with the challenges of a new political struggle, an armed doctrine which uses every weapon in the struggle around the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe live in a world, in short, where the principal problems that we face are not susceptible to military solutions alone. The role of our military power, in essence, is, therefore, to free ourselves and our allies to pursue the goals of freedom without the danger of enemy attack, but we do not have a separate military policy, and a separate diplomatic policy, and a separate disarmament policy, and a separate foreign aid policy, all unrelated to each other. They are all bound up together in the policy of the United States. Our goal is a coherent, overall, national security policy, one that truly serves the best interests of this country and those who depend upon it. It is worth noting that all of the decisions which we now face today will come in increased numbers in the months and years ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to congratulate all of you who have chosen the United States Air Force as a career. As far as any of us can now see in Washington in the days ahead, you will occupy positions of the highest responsibility, and merely because we move into a changing period of weapon technology, as well as political challenge, because, in fact, we move into that period, there is greater need for you than ever before. You, here today on this field, your colleagues at Omaha, Nebraska, or at Eglin in Florida, or who may be stationed in Western Europe, or men who are at sea in ships hundreds of miles from land, or soldiers in camps in Texas, or on the Island of Okinawa, they maintain the freedom by being on the ready. They maintain the freedom, the security, and the peace not only of the United States, but of the dozens of countries who are allied to us who are close to the Communist power and who depend upon us and, in a sense, only upon us for their freedom and security. These distant ships, these distant planes, these distant men keep the peace in a great half-circle stretching all the way from Berlin to South Korea. This is the role which history and our own determination has placed upon a country which lived most of its history in isolation and neutrality, and yet in the last 18 years has carried the burden for free people everywhere. I think that this is a burden which we accept willingly, recognizing that if this country does not accept it, no people will, recognizing that in the most difficult time in the whole life of freedom, the United States is called upon to play its greatest role. This is a role which we are proud to accept, and I am particularly proud to see the United States accept it in the presence of these young men who have committed themselves to the service of our country and to the cause of its freedom. I congratulate you all, and most of all, I congratulate your mothers and fathers who made it possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F.

It was in every sense an unforgettable experience. The people of Paris, of Vienna, of London, were generous in their greeting. They were heartwarming in their hospitality, and their graciousness to my wife is particularly appreciated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe knew of course that the crowds and the shouts were meant in large measure for the country that we represented, which is regarded as the chief defender of freedom. Equally memorable was the pageantry of European history and their culture that is very much a part of any ceremonial reception, to lay a wreath at the Arc de Triomphe, to dine at Versailles, and Schonbrunn Palace, and with the Queen of England. These are the colorful memories that will remain with us for many years to come. Each of the three cities that we visited--Paris, Vienna, and London--have existed for many centuries, and each serves as a reminder that the Western civilization that we seek to preserve has flowered over many years, and has defended itself over many centuries. But this was not a ceremonial trip. Two aims of American foreign policy, above all others, were the reason for the trip: the unity of the free world, whose strength is the security of us all, and the eventual achievement of a lasting peace. My trip was devoted to the advancement of these two aims.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo strengthen the unity of the West, our journey opened in Paris and closed in London. My talks with General de Gaulle were profoundly encouraging to me. Certain differences in our attitudes on one or another problem became insignificant in view of our common commitment to defend freedom. Our alliance, I believe, became more secure; the friendship of our nation, I hope--with theirs--became firmer; and the relations between the two of us who bear responsibility became closer, and I hope were marked by confidence. I found General de Gaulle far more interested in our frankly stating our position, whether or not it was his own, than in appearing to agree with him when we do not. But he knows full well the true meaning of an alliance. He is after all the only major leader of World War II who still occupies a position of great responsibility. His life has been one of unusual dedication; he is a man of extraordinary personal character, symbolizing the new strength and the historic grandeur of France. Throughout our discussions he took the long view of France and the world at large. I found him a wise counselor for the future, and an informative guide to the history that he has helped to make. Thus we had a valuable meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe that certain doubts and suspicions that might have come up in a long time--I believe were removed on both sides. Problems which proved to be not of substance but of wording or procedure were cleared away. No question, however sensitive, was avoided. No area of interest was ignored, and the conclusions that we reached will be important for the future--in our agreement on defending Berlin, on working to improve the defenses of Europe, on aiding the economic and political independence of the underdeveloped world, including Latin America, on spurring European economic unity, on concluding successfully the conference on Laos, and on closer consultations and solidarity in the Western alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral de Gaulle could not have been more cordial, and I could not have more confidence in any man. In addition to his individual strength of character, the French people as a whole showed vitality and energy which were both impressive and gratifying. Their recovery from the postwar period is dramatic, their productivity is increasing, and they are steadily building their stature in both Europe and Africa, and thus, I left Paris for Vienna with increased confidence in Western unity and strength.\\r\\nThe people of Vienna know what it is to live under occupation, and they know what it is to live in freedom. Their welcome to me as President of this country should be heartwarming to us all. I went to Vienna to meet the leader of the Soviet Union, Mr. Khrushchev. For 2 days we met in sober, intensive conversation, and I believe it is my obligation to the people, to the Congress, and to our allies to report on those conversations candidly and publicly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Khrushchev and I had a very full and frank exchange of views on the major issues that now divide our two countries. I will tell you now that it was a very sober 2 days. There was no discourtesy, no loss of tempers, no threats or ultimatums by either side; no advantage or concession was either gained or given; no major decision was either planned or taken; no spectacular progress was either achieved or pretended.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis kind of informal exchange may not be as exciting as a full-fledged summit meeting with a fixed agenda and a large corps of advisers, where negotiations are attempted and new agreements sought, but this was not intended to be and was not such a meeting, nor did we plan any future summit meetings at Vienna.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I found this meeting with Chairman Khrushchev, as somber as it was, to be immensely useful. I had read his speeches and of his policies. I had been advised on his views. I had been told by other leaders of the West, General de Gaulle, Chancellor Adenauer, Prime Minister Macmillan, what manner of man he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I bear the responsibility of the Presidency of the United States, and it is my duty to make decisions that no adviser and no ally can make for me. It is my obligation and responsibility to see that these decisions are as informed as possible, that they are based on as much direct, firsthand knowledge as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore thought it was of immense importance that I know Mr. Khrushchev, that I gain as much insight and understanding as I could on his present and future policies. At the same time, I wanted to make certain Mr. Khrushchev knew this country and its policies, that he understood our strength and our determination, and that he knew that we desired peace with all nations of every kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wanted to present our views to him directly, precisely, realistically, and with an opportunity for discussion and clarification. This was done. No new aims were stated in private that have not been stated in public on either side. The gap between us was not, in such a short period, materially reduced, but at least the channels of communications were opened more fully, at least the chances of a dangerous misjudgment on either side should now be less, and at least the men on whose decisions the peace in part depends have agreed to remain in contact.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is important, for neither of us tried to merely please the other, to agree merely to be agreeable, to say what the other wanted to hear. And just as our judicial system relies on witnesses appearing in court and on cross-examination, instead of hearsay testimony or affidavits on paper, so, too, was this direct give-and-take of immeasurable value in making clear and precise what we considered to be vital, for the facts of the matter are that the Soviets and ourselves give wholly different meanings to the same words--war, peace, democracy, and popular will.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have wholly different views of right and wrong, of what is an internal affair and what is aggression, and, above all, we have wholly different concepts of where the world is and where it is going.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly by such a discussion was it possible for me to be sure that Mr. Khrushchev knew how differently we view the present and the future. Our views contrasted sharply but at least we knew better at the end where we both stood. Neither of us was there to dictate a settlement or to convert the other to a cause or to concede our basic interests. But both of us were there, I think, because we realized that each nation has the power to inflict enormous damage upon the other, that such a war could and should be avoided if at all possible, since it would settle no dispute and prove no doctrine, and that care should thus be taken to prevent our conflicting interests from so directly confronting each other that war necessarily ensued. We believe in a system of national freedom and independence. He believes in an expanding and dynamic concept of world communism, and the question was whether these two systems can ever hope to live in peace without permitting any loss of security or any denial of the freedom of our friends. However difficult it may seem to answer this question in the affirmative as we approach so many harsh tests, I think we owe it to all mankind to make every possible effort. That is why I considered the Vienna talks to be useful. The somber mood that they conveyed was not cause for elation or relaxation, nor was it cause for undue pessimism or fear. It simply demonstrated how much work we in the free world have to do and how long and hard a struggle must be our fate as Americans in this generation as the chief defenders of the cause of liberty. The one area which afforded some immediate prospect of accord was Laos. Both sides recognized the need to reduce the dangers in that situation. Both sides endorsed the concept of a neutral and independent Laos, much in the manner of Burma or Cambodia.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf critical importance to the current conference on Laos in Geneva, both sides recognized the importance of an effective cease-fire. It is urgent that this be translated into new attitudes at Geneva, enabling the International Control Commission to do its duty, to make certain that a cease-fire is enforced and maintained. I am hopeful that progress can be made on this matter in the coming days at Geneva for that would greatly improve international atmosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo such hope emerged, however with respect to the other deadlocked Geneva conference, seeking a treaty to ban nuclear tests. Mr. Khrushchev made it clear that there could not be a neutral administrator--in his opinion because no one was truly neutral; that a Soviet veto would have to apply to acts of enforcement; that inspection was only a subterfuge for espionage, in the absence of total disarmament; and that the present test ban negotiations appeared futile. In short, our hopes for an end to nuclear tests, for an end to the spread of nuclear weapons, and for some slowing down of the arms race have been struck a serious blow. Nevertheless, the stakes are too important for us to abandon the draft treaty we have offered at Geneva.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut our most somber talks were on the subject of Germany and Berlin. I made it clear to Mr. Khrushchev that the security of Western Europe and therefore our own security are deeply involved in our presence and our access rights to West Berlin, that those rights are based on law and not on sufferance, and that we are determined to maintain those rights at any risk, and thus meet our obligation to the people of West Berlin, and their right to choose their own future.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Khrushchev, in turn, presented his views in detail, and his presentation will be the subject of further communications. But we are not seeking to change the present situation. A binding German peace treaty is a matter for all who were at war with Germany, and we and our allies cannot abandon our obligations to the people of West Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, Mr. Khrushchev did not talk in terms of war. He believes the world will move his way without resort to force. He spoke of his nation's achievements in space. He stressed his intention to outdo us in industrial production, to out-trade us, to prove to the world the superiority of his system over ours. Most of all, he predicted the triumph of communism in the new and less developed countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was certain that the tide there was moving his way, that the revolution of rising peoples would eventually be a Communist revolution, and that the so-called wars of liberation, supported by the Kremlin, would replace the old methods of direct aggression and invasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1940's and early fifties, the great danger was from Communist armies marching across free borders, which we saw in Korea. Our nuclear monopoly helped to prevent this in other areas. Now we face a new and different threat. We no longer have a nuclear monopoly. Their missiles, they believe, will hold off our missiles, and their troops can match our troops should we intervene in these so-called wars of liberation. Thus, the local conflict they support can turn in their favor through guerrillas or insurgents or subversion. A small group of disciplined Communists could exploit discontent and misery in a country where the average income may be $60 or $70 a year, and seize control, therefore, of an entire country without Communist troops ever crossing any international frontier. This is the Communist theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I believe just as strongly that time will prove it wrong, that liberty and independence and self-determination--not communism-is the future of man, and that free men have the will and the resources to win the struggle for freedom. But it is clear that this struggle in this area of the new and poorer nations will be a continuing crisis of this decade.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Khrushchev made one point which I wish to pass on. He said there are many disorders throughout the world, and he should not be blamed for them all. He is quite right. It is easy to dismiss as Communist-inspired every anti-government or anti-American riot, every overthrow of a corrupt regime, or every mass protest against misery and despair. These are not all Communist-inspired. The Communists move in to exploit them, to infiltrate their leadership, to ride their crest to victory. But the Communists did not create the conditions which caused them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, the hopes for freedom in these areas which see so much poverty and illiteracy, so many children who are sick, so many children-who die in the first year, so many families without homes, so many families without hope--the future for freedom in these areas rests with the local peoples and their governments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they have the will to determine their own future, if their governments have the support of their own people, if their honest and progressive measures--helping their people--have inspired confidence and zeal, then no guerrilla or insurgent action can succeed. But where those conditions do not exist, a military guarantee against external attack from across a border offers little protection against internal decay.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet all this does not mean that our Nation and the West and the free world can only sit by. On the contrary, we have an historic opportunity to help these countries build their societies until they are so strong and broadly based that only an outside invasion could topple them, and that threat, we know, can be stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can train and equip their forces to resist Communist-supplied insurrections. We can help develop the industrial and agricultural base on which new living standards can be built. We can encourage better administration and better education and better tax and land distribution and a better life for the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this and more we can do because we have the talent and the resources to do it, if we will only use and share them. I know that there is a great deal of feeling in the United States that we have carried the burden of economic assistance long enough, but these countries that we are now supporting-stretching all the way along from the top of Europe through the Middle East, down through Saigon--are now subject to great efforts internally, in many of them, to seize control.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we're not prepared to assist them in making a better life for their people, then I believe that the prospects for freedom in those areas are uncertain. We must, I believe, assist them if we are determined to meet with commitments of assistance our words against the Communist advance. The burden is heavy; we have carried it for many years. But I believe that this fight is not over. This battle goes on, and we have to play our part in it. And therefore I hope again that we will assist these people so that they can remain free.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was fitting that Congress opened its hearings on our new foreign military and economic aid programs in Washington at the very time that Mr. Khrushchev's words in Vienna were demonstrating as nothing else could the need for that very program. It should be well run, effectively administered, but I believe we must do it, and I hope that you, the American people, will support it again, because I think it's vitally important to the security of these areas. There is no use talking against the Communist advance unless we're willing to meet our responsibilities, however burdensome they may be.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not justify this aid merely on the grounds of anti-Communism. It is a recognition of our opportunity and obligation to help these people be free, and we are not alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found that the people of France, for example, were doing far more in Africa in the way of aiding independent nations than our own country was. But I know that foreign aid is a burden that is keenly felt and I can only say that we have no more crucial obligation now.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy stay in England was short but the visit gave me a chance to confer privately again with Prime Minister Macmillan, just as others of our party in Vienna were conferring yesterday with General de Gaulle and Chancellor Adenauer. We all agreed that there is work to be done in the West and from our conversations have come agreed steps to get on with that work. Our day in London, capped by a meeting with Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip was a strong reminder at the end of a long journey that the West remains united in its determination to hold to its standards.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay I conclude by saying simply that I am glad to be home. We have on this trip admired splendid places and seen stirring sights, but we are glad to be home. No demonstration of support abroad could mean so much as the support which you, the American people, have so generously given to our country. With that support I am not fearful of the future. We must be patient. We must be determined. We must be courageous. We must accept both risks and burdens, but with the will and the work freedom will prevail.\\r\\nGood night, and thank you very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood evening, my fellow citizens:\\r\\n\\r\\nI returned this morning from a week-long trip to Europe and I want to report to you on that trip in full. It was in every sense an unforgettable experience. The people of Paris, of Vienna, of London, were generous in their greeting. They were heartwarming in their hospitality, and their graciousness to my wife is particularly appreciated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe knew of course that the crowds and the shouts were meant in large measure for the country that we represented, which is regarded as the chief defender of freedom. Equally memorable was the pageantry of European history and their culture that is very much a part of any ceremonial reception, to lay a wreath at the Arc de Triomphe, to dine at Versailles, and Schonbrunn Palace, and with the Queen of England. These are the colorful memories that will remain with us for many years to come. Each of the three cities that we visited--Paris, Vienna, and London--have existed for many centuries, and each serves as a reminder that the Western civilization that we seek to preserve has flowered over many years, and has defended itself over many centuries. But this was not a ceremonial trip. Two aims of American foreign policy, above all others, were the reason for the trip: the unity of the free world, whose strength is the security of us all, and the eventual achievement of a lasting peace. My trip was devoted to the advancement of these two aims.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo strengthen the unity of the West, our journey opened in Paris and closed in London. My talks with General de Gaulle were profoundly encouraging to me. Certain differences in our attitudes on one or another problem became insignificant in view of our common commitment to defend freedom. Our alliance, I believe, became more secure; the friendship of our nation, I hope--with theirs--became firmer; and the relations between the two of us who bear responsibility became closer, and I hope were marked by confidence. I found General de Gaulle far more interested in our frankly stating our position, whether or not it was his own, than in appearing to agree with him when we do not. But he knows full well the true meaning of an alliance. He is after all the only major leader of World War II who still occupies a position of great responsibility. His life has been one of unusual dedication; he is a man of extraordinary personal character, symbolizing the new strength and the historic grandeur of France. Throughout our discussions he took the long view of France and the world at large. I found him a wise counselor for the future, and an informative guide to the history that he has helped to make. Thus we had a valuable meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe that certain doubts and suspicions that might have come up in a long time--I believe were removed on both sides. Problems which proved to be not of substance but of wording or procedure were cleared away. No question, however sensitive, was avoided. No area of interest was ignored, and the conclusions that we reached will be important for the future--in our agreement on defending Berlin, on working to improve the defenses of Europe, on aiding the economic and political independence of the underdeveloped world, including Latin America, on spurring European economic unity, on concluding successfully the conference on Laos, and on closer consultations and solidarity in the Western alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral de Gaulle could not have been more cordial, and I could not have more confidence in any man.

Kennedy\",\"title\":\"June 6, 1961: Report to the American People on Returning from Europe\"},{\"doc_name\":\"june-6-1962-remarks-west-point\",\"date\":\"1962-06-06\",\"transcript\":\"General Westmoreland, General Lemnitzer, Mr. Secretary, General Decker, General Taylor, members of the graduating class and their parents, gentlemen:\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to express my appreciation for your generous invitation to come to this graduating class. I am sure that all of you who sit here today realize, particularly in view of the song we have just heard, that you are part of a long tradition stretching back to the earliest days of this country's history, and that where you sit sat once some of the most celebrated names in our Nation's history, and also some who are not so well known, but who, on 100 different battlefields in many wars involving every generation of this country's history, have given very clear evidence of their commitment to their country.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that I know you feel a sense of pride in being part of that tradition, and as a citizen of the United States, as well as President, I want to express our high regard to all of you in appreciation for what you are doing and what you will do for our country in the days ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would also like to announce at this time that as Commander in Chief I am exercising my privilege of directing the Secretary of the Army and the Superintendent of West Point to remit all existing confinements and other cadet punishments, and I hope that it will be possible to carry this out today.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Westmoreland was slightly pained to hear that this was impending in view of the fact that one cadet, who I am confident will some day be the head of the Army, has just been remitted for 8 months, and is about to be released. But I am glad to have the opportunity to participate in the advancement of his military career.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy own confinement goes for another two and a half years, and I may ask for it to be extended instead of remitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to say that I wish all of you, the graduates, success. While I say that, I am not unmindful of the fact that two graduates of this Academy have reached the White House, and neither was a member of my party. Until I am more certain that this trend will be broken, I wish that all of you may be generals and not Commanders in Chief.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to say that I am sure you recognize that your schooling is only interrupted by today's occasion and not ended because the demands that will be made upon you in the service of your country in the coming months and years will be really more pressing, and in many ways more burdensome, as well as more challenging, than ever before in our history. I know that many of you may feel, and many of our citizens may feel that in these days of the nuclear age, when war may last in its final form a day or two or three days before much of the world is burned up, that your service to your country will be only standing and waiting. Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth. I am sure that many Americans believe that the days before World War II were the golden age when the stars were falling on all the graduates of West Point, that that was the golden time of service, and that you have moved into a period where military service, while vital, is not as challenging as it was then. Nothing could be further from the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact of the matter is that the period just ahead in the next decade will offer more opportunities for service to the graduates of this Academy than ever before in the history of the United States, because all around the world, in countries which are heavily engaged in the maintenance of their freedom, graduates of this Academy are heavily involved. Whether it is in Viet-Nam or in Laos or in Thailand, whether it is a military advisory group in Iran, whether it is a military attach? in some Latin American country during a difficult and challenging period, whether it is the commander of our troops in South Korea--the burdens that will be placed upon you when you fill those positions as you must inevitably, will require more from you than ever before in our history. The graduates of West Point, the Naval Academy, and the Air Academy in the next 10 years will have the greatest opportunity for the defense of freedom that this Academy's graduates have ever had. And I am sure that the Joint Chiefs of Staff endorse that view, knowing as they do and I do, the heavy burdens that are required of this Academy's graduates every day-General Tucker in Laos, or General Harkins in Viet-Nam, and a dozen others who hold key and significant positions involving the security of the United States and the defense of freedom. You are going to follow in their footsteps and I must say that I think that you will be privileged in the years ahead to find yourselves so heavily involved in the great interests of this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, I hope that you realize--and I hope every American realizes--how much we depend upon you. Your strictly military responsibilities, therefore, will require a versatility and an adaptability never before required in either war or in peace. They may involve the command and control of modern nuclear weapons and modern delivery systems, so complex that only a few scientists can understand their operation, so devastating that their inadvertent use would be of worldwide concern, but so new that their employment and their effects have never been tested in combat conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, your responsibilities may involve the command of more traditional forces, but in less traditional roles. Men risking their lives, not as combatants, but as instructors or advisers, or as symbols of our Nation's commitments. The fact that the United States is not directly at war in these areas in no way diminishes the skill and the courage that will be required, the service to our country which is rendered, or the pain of the casualties which are suffered.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo cite one final example of the range of responsibilities that will fall upon you: you may hold a position of command with our special forces, forces which are too unconventional to be called conventional, forces which are growing in number and importance and significance, for we now know that it is wholly misleading to call this \\\"the nuclear age,\\\" or to say that our security rests only on the doctrine of massive retaliation.\\r\\n\\r\\nKorea has not been the only battleground since the end of the Second World War. Men have fought and died in Malaya, in Greece, in the Philippines, in Algeria and Cuba and Cyprus, and almost continuously on the Indo-Chinese Peninsula. No nuclear weapons have been fired. No massive nuclear retaliation has been considered appropriate. This is another type of war, new in its intensity, ancient in its origin--war by guerrillas, subversives, insurgents, assassins, war by ambush instead of by combat; by infiltration, instead of aggression, seeking victory by eroding and exhausting the enemy instead of engaging him. It is a form of warfare uniquely adapted to what has been strangely called \\\"wars of liberation,\\\" to undermine the efforts of new and poor countries to maintain the freedom that they have finally achieved. It preys on economic unrest and ethnic conflicts. It requires in those situations where we must counter it, and these are the kinds of challenges that will be before us in the next decade if freedom is to be saved, a whole new kind of strategy, a wholly different kind of force, and therefore a new and wholly different kind of military training.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I have spoken thus far only of the military challenges which your education must prepare you for. The nonmilitary problems which you will face will also be most demanding, diplomatic, political, and economic. In the years ahead, some of you will serve as advisers to foreign aid missions or even to foreign governments. Some will negotiate terms of a cease-fire with broad political as well as military ramifications. Some of you will go to the far corners of the earth, and to the far reaches of space. Some of you will sit in the highest councils of the Pentagon. Others will hold delicate command posts which are international in character. Still others will advise on plans to abolish arms instead of using them to abolish others. Whatever your position, the scope of your decisions will not be confined to the traditional tenets of military competence and training. You will need to know and understand not only the foreign policy of the United States but the foreign policy of all countries scattered around the world who 20 years ago were the most distant names to us. You will need to give orders in different tongues and read maps by different systems. You will be involved in economic judgments which most economists would hesitate to make. At what point, for example, does military aid become burdensome to a country and make its freedom endangered rather than helping to secure it? To what extent can the gold and dollar cost of our overseas deployments be offset by foreign procurement? Or at what stage can a new weapons system be considered sufficiently advanced to justify large dollar appropriations?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many countries, your posture and performance will provide the local population with the only evidence of what our country is really like. In other countries, your military mission, its advice and action, will play a key role in determining whether those people will remain free. You will need to understand the importance of military power and also the limits of military power, to decide what arms should be used to fight and when they should be used to prevent a fight, to determine what represents our vital interests and what interests are only marginal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove all, you will have a responsibility to deter war as well as to fight it. For the basic problems facing the world today are not susceptible of a final military solution. While we will long require the services and admire the dedication and commitment of the fighting men of this country, neither our strategy nor our psychology as a nation, and certainly not our economy, must become permanently dependent upon an ever-increasing military establishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur forces, therefore, must fulfill a broader role as a complement to our diplomacy, as an arm of our diplomacy, as a deterrent to our adversaries, and as a symbol to our allies of our determination to support them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is why this Academy has seen its curriculum grow and expand in dimension, in substance, and in difficulty. That is why you cannot possibly have crowded into these 4 busy years all of the knowledge and all of the range of experience which you must bring to these subtle and delicate tasks which I have described. And that is why go to school year after year so you can serve this country to the best of your ability and your talent.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo talk of such talent and effort raises in the minds, I am sure, of everyone, and the minds of all of our countrymen, why--why should men such as you, able to master the complex arts of science, mathematics, language, economy, and all the rest devote their lives to a military career, with all of its risks and hardships? Why should their families be expected to make the personal and financial sacrifices that a military career inevitably brings with it? When there is a visible enemy to fight in open combat, the answer is not so difficult. Many serve, all applaud, and the tide of patriotism runs high. But when there is a long, slow struggle, with no immediate visible foe, your choice will seem hard indeed. And you will recall, I am sure, the lines found in an old sentry box in Gibraltar:\\r\\n\\r\\nGod and the soldier all men adore\\r\\n\\r\\nIn time of trouble--and no more,\\r\\n\\r\\nFor when war is over, and all things righted,\\r\\n\\r\\nGod is neglected--and the old soldier slighted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut you have one satisfaction, however difficult those days may be: when you are asked by a President of the United States or by any other American what you are doing for your country, no man's answer will be clearer than your own. And that moral motivation which brought you here in the first place is part of your training here as well. West Point was not built to produce technical experts alone. It was built to produce men committed to the defense of their country, leaders of men who understand the great stakes which are involved, leaders who can be entrusted with the heavy responsibility which modern weapons and the fight for freedom entail, leaders who can inspire in their men the same sense of obligation to duty which you bring to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no single slogan that you can repeat to yourself in hard days or give to those who may be associated with you. In times past, a simple phrase, \\\"54-40 or fight\\\" or \\\"to make the world safe for democracy\\\"-that was enough. But the times, the weapons, and the issues are now more complicated than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nEighteen years ago today, Ernie Pyle, describing those tens of thousands of young men who crossed the \\\"ageless and indifferent\\\" sea of the English Channel, searched in vain for a word to describe what they were fighting for. And finally he concluded that they were at least fighting for each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou and I leave here today to meet our separate responsibilities, to protect our Nation's vital interests by peaceful means if possible, by resolute action if necessary. And we go forth confident of support and success because we know that we are working and fighting for each other and for all those men and women all over the globe who are determined to be free.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"June 6, 1962: Remarks at West Point\"},{\"doc_name\":\"june-7-1961-remarks-graduating-class-us-naval-academy\",\"date\":\"1961-06-07\",\"transcript\":\"Admiral, Mr. Secretary, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of the faculty, members of the Graduating Class and their families:\\r\\n\\r\\nI am proud as a citizen of the United States to come to this institution and this room where there is concentrated so many men who have committed themselves to the defense of the United States. I am honored to be here.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past I have had some slight contact with this Service, though I never did reach the state of professional and physical perfection where I could hope that anyone would ever mistake me for an Annapolis graduate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know that you are constantly warned during your days here not to mix, in your Naval career, in politics. I should point out, however, on the other side, that my rather rapid rise from a Reserve Lieutenant, of uncertain standing, to Commander-in-Chief, has been because I did not follow that very good advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nI trust, however, that those of you who are Regulars will, for a moment, grant a retired civilian officer some measure of fellowship.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly a half century ago, President Woodrow Wilson came here to Annapolis on a similar mission, and addressed the Class of 1914. On that day, the graduating class numbered 154 men. There has been, since that time, a revolution in the size of our military establishment, and that revolution has been reflected in the revolution in the world around us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Wilson addressed the class in 1914, the Victorian structure of power was still intact, the world was dominated by Europe, and Europe itself was the scene of an uneasy balance of power between dominant figures and America was a spectator on a remote sideline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe autumn after Wilson came to Annapolis, the Victorian world began to fall to pieces, and our world one-half a century later is vastly different. Today we are witnesses to the most extraordinary revolution, nearly, in the history of the world, as the emergent nations of Latin America, Africa, and Asia awaken from long centuries of torpor and impatience.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday the Victorian certitude's which were taken to be so much a part of man's natural existence are under siege by a faith committed to the destruction of liberal civilization, and today the United States is no longer the spectator, but the leader.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis half century, therefore, has not only revolutionized the size of our military establishment, it has brought about also a more striking revolution in the things that the Nation expects from the men in our Service.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifty years ago the graduates of the Naval Academy were expected to be seamen and leaders of men. They were reminded of the saying of John Paul Jones, \\\"Give me a fair ship so that I might go into harm's way.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Captain Mahan began to write in the nineties on the general issues of war and peace and naval strategy, the Navy quickly shipped him to sea duty. Today we expect all of you--in fact, you must, of necessity-be prepared not only to handle a ship in a storm or a landing party on a beach, but to make great determinations which affect the survival of this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe revolution in the technology of war makes it necessary in order that you, when you hold positions of command, may make an educated judgment between various techniques, that you also be a scientist and an engineer and a physicist, and your responsibilities go far beyond the classic problems of tactics and strategy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the years to come, some of you will serve as your Commandant did last year, as an adviser to foreign governments; some will negotiate as Admiral Burke did, in Korea, with other governments on behalf of the United States; some will go to the far reaches of space and some will go to the bottom of the ocean. Many of you from one time or another, in the positions of command, or as members of staff, will participate in great decisions which go far beyond the narrow reaches of professional competence.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou gentlemen, therefore, have a most important responsibility, to recognize that your education is just beginning, and to be prepared, in the most difficult period in the life of our country, to play the role that the country hopes and needs and expects from you. You must understand not only this country but other countries. You must know something about strategy and tactics and logic--logistics, but also economics and politics and diplomacy and history. You must know everything you can know about military power, and you must also understand the limits of military power. You must understand that few of the important problems of our time have, in the final analysis, been finally solved by military power alone. When I say that officers today must go far beyond the official curriculum, I say it not because I do not believe in the traditional relationship between the civilian and the military, but you must be more than the servants of national policy. You must be prepared to play a constructive role in the development of national policy, a policy which protects our interests and our security and the peace of the world. Woodrow Wilson reminded your predecessors that you were not serving a government or an administration, but a people. In serving the American people, you represent the American people and the best of the ideals of this free society. Your posture and your performance will provide many people far beyond our shores, who know very little of our country, the only evidence they will ever see as to whether America is truly dedicated to the cause of justice and freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my inaugural address, I said that each citizen should be concerned not with what his country can do for him, but what he can do for his country. What you have chosen to do for your country, by devoting your life to the service of our country, is the greatest contribution that any man could make. It is easy for you, in a moment of exhilaration today, to say that you freely and gladly dedicate your life to the United States. But the life of service is a constant test of your will.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be hard at times to face the personal sacrifice and the family inconvenience, to maintain this high resolve, to place the needs of your country above all else. When there is a visible enemy to fight, the tide of patriotism in this country runs strong. But when there is a long, slow struggle, with no immediate visible foe, when you watch your contemporaries indulging the urge for material gain and comfort and personal advancement, your choice will seem hard, and you will recall, I am sure, the lines found in an old sentry box at Gibraltar, \\\"God and the soldier all men adore in time of trouble and no more, for when war is over, and all things righted, God is neglected and the old soldier slighted.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNever forget, however, that the battle for freedom takes many forms. Those who through vigilance and firmness and devotion are the great servants of this country--and let us have no doubt that the United States needs your devoted assistance today.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer to those who challenge us so severely in so many parts of the globe lies in our willingness to freely commit ourselves to the maintenance of our country and the things for which it stands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ceremony today represents the kind of commitment which you are willing to make. For that reason, I am proud to be here. This nation salutes you as you commence your service to our country in the hazardous days ahead. And on behalf of all of them, I congratulate you and thank you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F.

I am also sending to Congress a message proposing authorization of a permanent Peace Corps. This Corps will be a pool of trained American men and women sent overseas by the U.S. Government or through private institutions and organizations to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower.\\r\\nIt is our hope to have 500 or more people in the field by the end of the year. The initial reactions to the Peace Corps proposal are convincing proof that we have, in this country, an immense reservoir of such men and women—anxious to sacrifice their energies and time and toil to the cause of world peace and human progress.\\r\\nIn establishing our Peace Corps we intend to make full use of the resources and talents of private institutions and groups. Universities, voluntary agencies, labor unions and industry will be asked to share in this effort—contributing diverse sources of energy and imagination—making it clear that the responsibility for peace is the responsibility of our entire society.\\r\\nWe will only send abroad Americans who are wanted by the host country—who have a real job to do—and who are qualified to do that job. Programs will be developed with care, and after full negotiation, in order to make sure that the Peace Corps is wanted and will contribute to the welfare of other people. Our Peace Corps is not designed as an instrument of diplomacy or propaganda or ideological conflict. It is designed to permit our people to exercise more fully their responsibilities in the great common cause of world development.\\r\\nLife in the Peace Corps will not be easy. There will be no salary and allowances will be at a level sufficient only to maintain health and meet basic needs. Men and women will be expected to work and live alongside the nationals of the country in which they are stationed—doing the same work, eating the same food, talking the same language.\\r\\nBut if the life will not be easy, it will be rich and satisfying. For every young American who participates in the Peace Corps—who works in a foreign land—will know that he or she is sharing in the great common task of bringing to man that decent way of life which is the foundation of freedom and a condition of peace.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"March 1, 1961: Establishment of the Peace Corps\"},{\"doc_name\":\"march-13-1961-address-diplomatic-corps-latin-america\",\"date\":\"1961-03-13\",\"transcript\":\"It is a great pleasure for Mrs. Kennedy and for me, for the Vice President and Mrs. Johnson, and for the Members of Congress, to welcome the Ambassadorial Corps of our Hemisphere, our long time friends, to the White House today. One hundred and thirty-nine years ago this week the United States, stirred by the heroic struggle of its fellow Americans, urged the independence and recognition of the new Latin American Republics. It was then, at the dawn of freedom throughout this hemisphere, that Bolivar spoke of his desire to see the Americas fashioned into the greatest region in the world, \\\"greatest,\\\" he said, \\\"not so much by virtue of her area and her wealth, as by her freedom and her glory.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNever in the long history of our hemisphere has this dream been nearer to fulfillment, and never has it been in greater danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genius of our scientists has given us the tools to bring abundance to our land, strength to our industry, and knowledge to our people. For the first time we have the capacity to strike off the remaining bonds of poverty and ignorance--to free our people for the spiritual and intellectual fulfillment which has always been the goal of our civilization.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet at this very moment of maximum opportunity, we confront the same forces which have imperiled America throughout its history--the alien forces which once again seek to impose the despotisms of the Old World on the people of the New.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have asked you to come here today so that I might discuss these challenges and these dangers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe meet together as firm and ancient friends, united by history and experience and by our determination to advance the values of American civilization. For this New World of ours is not a mere accident of geography. Our continents are bound together by a common history, the endless exploration of new frontiers. Our nations are the product of a common struggle, the revolt from colonial rule. And our people share a common heritage, the quest for the dignity and the freedom of man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe revolutions which gave us birth ignited, in the words of Thomas Paine, \\\"a spark never to be extinguished.\\\" And across vast, turbulent continents these American ideals still stir man's struggle for national independence and individual freedom. But as we welcome the spread of the American revolution to other lands, we must also remember that our own struggle--the revolution which began in Philadelphia in 1776, and in Caracas in 1811--is not yet finished. Our hemisphere's mission is not yet completed. For our unfulfilled task is to demonstrate to the entire world that man's unsatisfied aspiration for economic progress and social justice can best be achieved by free men working within a framework of democratic institutions. If we can do this in our own hemisphere, and for our own people, we may yet realize the prophecy of the great Mexican patriot, Benito Juarez, that \\\"democracy is the destiny of future humanity.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a citizen of the United States let me be the first to admit that we North Americans have not always grasped the significance of this common mission, just as it is also true that many in your own countries have not fully understood the urgency of the need to lift people from poverty and ignorance and despair. But we must turn from these mistakes from the failures and the misunderstandings of the past to a future full of peril, but bright with hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout Latin America, a continent rich in resources and in the spiritual and cultural achievements of its people, millions of men and women suffer the daily degradations of poverty and hunger. They lack decent shelter or protection from disease. Their children are deprived of the education or the jobs which are the gateway to a better life. And each day the problems grow more urgent. Population growth is outpacing economic growth--low living standards are further endangered--and discontent--the discontent of a people who know that abundance and the tools of progress are at last within their reach--that discontent is growing. In the words of Jose Figueres, \\\"once dormant peoples are struggling upward toward the sun, toward a better life.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we are to meet a problem so staggering in its dimensions, our approach must itself be equally bold--an approach consistent with the majestic concept of Operation Pan America. Therefore I have called on all people of the hemisphere to join in a new Alliance for Progress--Alianza para Progreso--a vast cooperative effort, unparalleled in magnitude and nobility of purpose, to satisfy the basic needs of the American people for homes, work and land, health and schools--techo, trabajo y tierra, salud y escuela,\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, I propose that the American Republics begin on a vast new Ten Year Plan for the Americas, a plan to transform the 1960's into a historic decade of democratic progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese 10 years will be the years of maximum progress-maximum effort, the years when the greatest obstacles must be overcome, the years when the need for assistance will be the greatest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if we are successful, if our effort is bold enough and determined enough, then the close of this decade will mark the beginning of a new era in the American experience. The living standards of every American family will be on the rise, basic education will be available to all, hunger will be a forgotten experience, the need for massive outside help will have passed, most nations will have entered a period of self-sustaining growth, and though there will be still much to do, every American Republic will be the master of its own revolution and its own hope and progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me stress that only the most determined efforts of the American nations themselves can bring success to this effort. They, and they alone, can mobilize their resources, enlist the energies of their people, and modify their social patterns so that all, and not just a privileged few, share in the fruits of growth. If this effort is made, then outside assistance will give vital impetus to progress; without it, no amount of help will advance the welfare of the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus if the countries of Latin America are ready to do their part, and I am sure they are, then I believe the United States, for its part, should help provide resources of a scope and magnitude sufficient to make this bold development plan a success--just as we helped to provide, against equal odds nearly, the resources adequate to help rebuild the economies of Western Europe. For only an effort of towering dimensions can ensure fulfillment of our plan for a decade of progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, I will shortly request a ministerial meeting of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council, a meeting at which we can begin the massive planning effort which will be at the heart of the Alliance for Progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor if our Alliance is to succeed, each Latin nation must formulate long-range plans for its own development, plans which establish targets and priorities, ensure monetary stability, establish the machinery for vital social change, stimulate private activity and initiative, and provide for a maximum national effort. These plans will be the foundation of our development effort, and the basis for the allocation of outside resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nA greatly strengthened IA-ECOSOC, working with the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Inter-American Development Bank, can assemble the leading economists and experts of the hemisphere to help each country develop its own development plan--and provide a continuing review of economic progress in this hemisphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, I have this evening signed a request to the Congress for $500 million as a first step in fulfilling the Act of Bogota. This is the first large-scale Inter-American effort, instituted by my predecessor President Eisenhower, to attack the social barriers which block economic progress. The money will be used to combat illiteracy, improve the productivity and use of their land, wipe out disease, attack archaic tax and land tenure structures, provide educational opportunities, and offer a broad range of projects designed to make the benefits of increasing abundance available to all. We will begin to commit these funds as soon as they are appropriated.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth, we must support all economic integration which is a genuine step toward larger markets and greater competitive opportunity. The fragmentation of Latin American economies is a serious barrier to industrial growth. Projects such as the Central American common market and free trade areas in South America can help to remove these obstacles.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth, the United States is ready to cooperate in serious, case-by-case examinations of commodity market problems. Frequent violent change in commodity prices seriously injure the economies of many Latin American countries, draining their resources and stultifying their growth. Together we must find practical methods of bringing an end to this pattern.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixth, we will immediately step up our Food for Peace emergency program, help establish food reserves in areas of recurrent drought, help provide school lunches for children, and offer feed grains for use in rural development. For hungry men and women cannot wait for economic discussions or diplomatic meetings--their need is urgent--and their hunger rests heavily on the conscience of their fellow men.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeventh, all the people of the hemisphere must be allowed to share in the expanding wonders of science--wonders which have captured man's imagination, challenged the powers of his mind, and given him the tools for rapid progress. I invite Latin American scientists to work with us in new projects in fields such as medicine and agriculture, physics and astronomy, and desalinization, to help plan for regional research laboratories in these and other fields, and to strengthen cooperation between American universities and laboratories.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also intend to expand our science teacher training programs to include Latin American instructors, to assist in establishing such programs in other American countries, and translate and make available revolutionary new teaching materials in physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics, so that the young of all nations may contribute their skills to the advance of science.\\r\\n\\r\\nEighth, we must rapidly expand the training of those needed to man the economies of rapidly developing countries. This means expanded technical training programs, for which the Peace Corps, for example, will be available when needed. It also means assistance to Latin American universities, graduate schools, and research institutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe welcome proposals in Central America for intimate cooperation in higher education--cooperation which can achieve a regional effort of increased effectiveness and excellence. We are ready to help fill the gap in trained manpower, realizing that our ultimate goal must be a basic education for all who wish to learn.\\r\\n\\r\\nNinth, we reaffirm our pledge to come to the defense of any American nation whose independence is endangered. As its confidence in the collective security system of the OAS spreads, it will be possible to devote to constructive use a major share of those resources now spent on the instruments of war. Even now, as the government of Chile has said, the time has come to take the first steps toward sensible limitations of arms. And the new generation of military leaders has shown an increasing awareness that armies cannot only defend their countries--they can, as we have learned through our own Corps of Engineers, they can help to build them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTenth, we invite our friends in Latin America to contribute to the enrichment of life and culture in the United States. We need teachers of your literature and history and tradition, opportunities for our young people to study in your universities, access to your music, your art, and the thought of your great philosophers. For we know we have much to learn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this way you can help bring a fuller spiritual and intellectual life to the people of the United States--and contribute to understanding and mutual respect among the nations of the hemisphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith steps such as these, we propose to complete the revolution of the Americas, to build a hemisphere where all men can hope for a suitable standard of living, and all can live out their lives in dignity and in freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo achieve this goal political freedom must accompany material progress. Our Alliance for Progress is an alliance of free governments, and it must work to eliminate tyranny from a hemisphere in which it has no rightful place. Therefore let us express our special friendship to the people of Cuba and the Dominican Republic--and the hope they will soon rejoin the society of free men, uniting with us in common effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis political freedom must be accompanied by social change. For unless necessary social reforms, including land and tax reform, are freely made--unless we broaden the opportunity for all of our people--unless the great mass of Americans share in increasing prosperity--then our alliance, our revolution, our dream, and our freedom will fail. But we call for social change by free men-change in the spirit of Washington and Jefferson, of Bolivar and San Martin and Martin--not change which seeks to impose on men tyrannies which we cast out a century and a half ago. Our motto is what it has always been--progress yes, tyranny no-progreso si, tirania no!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut our greatest challenge comes from within--the task of creating an American civilization where spiritual and cultural values are strengthened by an ever-broadening base of material advance--where, within the rich diversity of its own traditions, each nation is free to follow its own path towards progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe completion of our task will, of course, require the efforts of all governments of our hemisphere. But the efforts of governments alone will never be enough. In the end, the people must choose and the people must help themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so I say to the men and women of the Americas--to the campesino in the fields, to the obrero in the cities, to the estudiante in the schools--prepare your mind and heart for the task ahead--call forth your strength and let each devote his energies to the betterment of all, so that your children and our children in this hemisphere can find an ever richer and a freer life.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us once again transform the American continent into a vast crucible of revolutionary ideas and efforts--a tribute to the power of the creative energies of free men and women--an example to all the world that liberty and progress walk hand in hand. Let us once again awaken our American revolution until it guides the struggle of people everywhere--not with an imperialism of force or fear--but the rule of courage and freedom and hope for the future of man.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"March 13, 1961: Address to the Diplomatic Corps of Latin America\"},{\"doc_name\":\"march-23-1962-address-university-california-berkeley\",\"date\":\"1962-03-23\",\"transcript\":\"Mr. President, Governor Brown, Dr. Pauley, Chancellor, members of the Board of Regents, members of the faculty and fellow students, ladies and gentlemen:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last time that I came to this Stadium was 22 years ago, when I visited it in November of 1940 as a student at a nearby small school for the game with Stanford. And we got a--I must say I had a much warmer reception today than I did from my Coast friends here on that occasion. In those days we used to fill these universities for football, and now we do it for academic events, and I'm not sure that this doesn't represent a rather dangerous trend for the future of our country.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am delighted to be here on this occasion for though it is the 94th anniversary of the Charter, in a sense this is the hundredth anniversary. For this university and so many other universities across our country owe their birth to the most extraordinary piece of legislation which this country has ever adopted, and that is the Morrill Act, signed by President Abraham Lincoln in the darkest and most uncertain days of the Civil War, which set before the country the opportunity to build the great land-grant colleges, of which this is so distinguished a part. Six years later, this university obtained its Charter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its first graduating class it included a future Governor of California, a future Congressman, a judge, a State assemblyman, a clergyman, a lawyer, a doctor--all in a graduating class of 12 students!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis college, therefore, from its earliest beginnings, has recognized, and its graduates have recognized, that the purpose of education is not merely to advance the economic self-interest of its graduates. The people of California, as much if not more than the people of any other State, have supported their colleges and their universities and their schools, because they recognize how important it is to the maintenance of a free society that its citizens be well educated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Every man,\\\" said Professor Woodrow Wilson, \\\"sent out from a university should be a man of his nation as well as a man of his time.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Prince Bismarck was even more specific. One third, he said, of the students of German universities broke down from overwork, another third broke down from dissipation, and the other third ruled Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not know which third of students are here today, but I am confident that I am talking to the future leaders of this State and country who recognize their responsibilities to the public interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday you carry on that tradition. Our distinguished and courageous Secretary of Defense, our distinguished Secretary of State, the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, the Director of the CIA and others, all are graduates of this University. It is a disturbing fact to me, and it may be to some of you, that the New frontier owes as much to Berkeley as it does to Harvard University.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has been a week of momentous events around the world. The long and painful struggle in Algeria which comes to an end. Both nuclear powers and neutrals labored at Geneva for a solution to the problem of a spiraling arms race, and also to the problems that so vex our relations with the Soviet Union. The Congress opened hearings on a trade bill, which is far more than a trade bill, but an opportunity to build a stronger and closer Atlantic Community. And my wife had her first and last ride on an elephant!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut history may well remember this as a week for an act of lesser immediate impact, and that is the decision by the United States and the Soviet Union to seek concrete agreements on the joint exploration of space. Experience has taught us that an agreement to negotiate does not always mean a negotiated agreement. But should such a joint effort be realized, its significance could well be tremendous for us all. In terms of space science, our combined knowledge and efforts can benefit the people of all the nations: joint weather satellites to provide more ample warnings against destructive storms-joint communications systems to draw the world more closely together--and cooperation in space medicine research and space tracking operations to speed the day when man will go to the moon and beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the scientific gains from such a joint effort would offer, I believe, less realized return than the gains for world peace. For a cooperative Soviet-American effort in space science and exploration would emphasize the interests that must unite us, rather than those that always divide us. It offers us an area in which the stale and sterile dogmas of the cold war could be literally left a quarter of a million miles behind. And it would remind us on both sides that knowledge, not hate, is the passkey to the future--that knowledge transcends national antagonisms-that it speaks a universal language-that it is the possession, not of a single class, or of a single nation or a single ideology, but of all mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI need hardly emphasize the happy pursuit of knowledge in this place. Your faculty includes more Nobel laureates than any other faculty in the world--more in this one community than our principal adversary has received since the awards began in 1901. And we take pride in that, only from a national point of view, because it indicates, as the Chancellor pointed out, the great intellectual benefits of a free society. This University of California will continue to grow as an intellectual center because your presidents and your chancellors and your professors have rigorously defended that unhampered freedom of discussion and inquiry which is the soul of the intellectual enterprise and the heart of a free university.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may be proud as a nation of our record in scientific achievement--but at the same time we must be impressed by the interdependence of all knowledge. I am certain that every scholar and scientist here today would agree that his own work has benefited immeasurably from the work of the men and women in other countries. The prospect of a partnership with Soviet scientists in the exploration of space opens up exciting prospects of collaboration in other areas of learning. And cooperation in the pursuit of knowledge can hopefully lead to cooperation in the pursuit of peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the pursuit of knowledge itself implies a world where men are free to follow out the logic of their own ideas. It implies a world where nations are free to solve their own problems and to realize their own ideals. It implies, in short, a world where collaboration emerges from the voluntary decisions of nations strong in their own independence and their own self-respect. It implies, I believe, the kind of world which is emerging before our eyes--the world produced by the revolution of national independence which has today, and has been since 1945, sweeping across the face of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sometimes think that we are too much impressed by the clamor of daily events. The newspaper headlines and the television screens give us a short view. They so flood us with the stop-press details of daily stories that we lose sight of one of the great movements of history. Yet it is the profound tendencies of history and not the passing excitements, that will shape our future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe short view gives us the impression as a nation of being shoved and harried, everywhere on the defense. But this impression is surely an optical illusion. From the perspective of Moscow, the world today may seem ever more troublesome, more intractable, more frustrating than it does to us. The leaders of the Communist world are confronted not only by acute internal problems in each Communist country--the failure of agriculture, the rising discontent of the youth and the intellectuals, the demands of technical and managerial groups for status and security. They are confronted in addition by profound divisions within the Communist world itself--divisions which have already shattered the image of Communism as a universal system guaranteed to abolish all social and international conflicts--the most valuable asset the Communists had for many years.\\r\\n\\r\\nWisdom requires the long view. And the long view shows us that the revolution of national independence is a fundamental fact of our era. This revolution will not be stopped. As new nations emerge from the oblivion of centuries, their first aspiration is to affirm their national identity. Their deepest hope is for a world where, within a framework of international cooperation, every country can solve its own problems according to its own traditions and ideals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is in the interests of the pursuit of .knowledge--and it is in our own national interest--that this revolution of national independence succeed. For the Communists rest everything on the idea of a monolithic world--a world where all knowledge has a single pattern, all societies move toward a single model, and all problems and roads have a single solution and a single destination. The pursuit of knowledge, on the other hand, rests everything on the opposite idea--on the idea of a world based on diversity, self-determination, freedom. And that is the kind of world to which we Americans, as a nation, are committed by the principles upon which the great Republic was founded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs men conduct the pursuit of knowledge, they create a world which freely unites national diversity and international partnership. This emerging world is incompatible with the Communist world order. It will irresistibly burst the bonds of the Communist organization and the Communist ideology. And diversity and independence, far from being opposed to the American conception of world order, represent the very essence of our view of the future of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere used to be so much talk a few years ago about the inevitable triumph of communism. We hear such talk much less now. No one who examines the modern world can doubt that the great currents of history are carrying the world away from the monolithic idea towards the pluralistic idea--away from communism and towards national independence and freedom. No one can doubt that the wave of the future is not the conquest of the world by a single dogmatic creed but the liberation of the diverse energies of free nations and free men. No one can doubt that cooperation in the pursuit of knowledge must lead to freedom of the mind and freedom of the soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the drumfire of daily crisis, therefore, there is arising the outlines of a robust and vital world community, founded on nations secure in their own independence, and united by allegiance to world peace. It would be foolish to say that this world will be won tomorrow, or the day after. The processes of history are fitful and uncertain and aggravating. There will be frustrations and setbacks. There will be times of anxiety and gloom. The specter of thermonuclear war will continue to hang over mankind; and we must heed the advice of Oliver Wendell Holmes of \\\"freedom leaning on her spear\\\" until all nations are wise enough to disarm safely and effectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet we can have a new confidence today in the direction in which history is moving. Nothing is more stirring than the recognition of great public purpose. Every great age is marked by innovation and daring-by the ability to meet unprecedented problems with intelligent solutions. In a time of turbulence and change, it is more true than ever that knowledge is power; for only by true understanding and steadfast judgment are we able to master the challenge of history.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this is so, we must strive to acquire knowledge--and to apply it with wisdom. We must reject over-simplified theories of international life--the theory that American power is unlimited, or that the American mission is to remake the world in the American image. We must seize the vision of a free and diverse world--and shape our policies to speed progress toward a more flexible world order.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the unifying spirit of our policies in the world today. The purpose of our aid programs must be to help developing countries move forward as rapidly as possible on the road to genuine national independence. Our military policies must assist nations to protect the processes of democratic reform and development against disruption and intervention. Our diplomatic policies must strengthen our relations with the whole world, with our several alliances and within the United Nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we press forward on every front to realize a flexible world order, the role of the university becomes ever more important, both as a reservoir of ideas and as a repository of the long view of the shore dimly seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Knowledge is the great sun of the firmament,\\\" said Senator Daniel Webster. \\\"Life and power are scattered with all its beams.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its light, we must think and act not only for the moment but for our time. I am reminded of the story of the great French Marshal Lyautey, who once asked his gardener to plant a tree. The gardener objected that the tree was slow-growing and would not reach maturity for a hundred years. The Marshal replied, \\\"In that case, there is no time to lose, plant it this afternoon.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nToday a world of knowledge--a world of cooperation--a just and lasting peace--may be years away. But we have no time to lose. Let us plant our trees this afternoon.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"March 23, 1962: Address at the University of California, Berkeley\"},{\"doc_name\":\"may-17-1961-address-canadian-parliament\",\"date\":\"1961-05-17\",\"transcript\":\"Mr. Speaker of the Senate, Mr. Speaker of the House, Mr. Prime Minister, Members of the Canadian Houses of Parliament, distinguished guests and friends:\\r\\n\\r\\nI am grateful for the generous remarks and kind sentiments toward my country and myself, Mr. Prime Minister. We in the United States have an impression that this country is made up of descendants of the English and the French. But I was glad to hear some applause coming from the very back benches when you mentioned Ireland. I am sure they are making progress forward. Je me sens vraiment entre amis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a deeply felt honor to address this distinguished legislative body. And yet may I say that I feel very much at home with you here today. For one-third of my life was spent in the Parliament of my own country-the United States Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some differences between this body and my own, the most noticeable to me is the lofty appearance of statesmanship which is on the faces of the Members of the--Senators who realize that they will never have to place their cause before the people again!\\r\\n\\r\\nI feel at home also here because I number in my own State of Massachusetts many friends and former constituents who are of Canadian descent. Among the voters of Massachusetts who were born outside the United States, the largest group by far was born in Canada. Their vote is enough to determine the outcome of an election, even a Presidential election. You can understand that having been elected President of the United States by less than 140 thousand votes out of 60 million, that I am very conscious of these statistics!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe warmth of your hospitality symbolizes more than merely the courtesy which may be accorded to an individual visitor. They symbolize the enduring qualities of amity and honor which have characterized our countries' relations for so many decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly forty years ago, a distinguished Prime Minister of this country took the part of the United States at a disarmament conference. He said, \\\"They may not be angels but they are at least our friends.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI must say that I do not think that we probably demonstrated in that forty years that we are angels yet, but I hope we have demonstrated that we are at least friends. And I must say that I think in these days where hazard is our constant companion, that friends are a very good thing to have.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prime Minister was the first of the leaders from other lands who was invited to call upon me shortly after I entered the White House; and this is my first trip--the first trip of my wife and myself outside of our country's borders. It is just and fitting, and appropriate and traditional, that I should come here to Canada--across a border that knows neither guns nor guerrillas.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we share more than a common border. We share a common heritage, traced back to those early settlers who traveled from the beachheads of the Maritime Provinces and New England to the far reaches of the Pacific Coast. Henry Thoreau spoke a common sentiment for them all: \\\"Eastward I go only by force, Westward I go free. I must walk towards Oregon and not towards Europe.\\\" We share common values from the past, a common defense line at present, and common aspirations for the future-our future, and indeed the future of all mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeography has made us neighbors. History has made us friends. Economics has made us partners. And necessity has made us allies. Those whom nature hath so joined together, let no man put asunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat unites us is far greater than what divides us. The issues and irritants that inevitably affect all neighbors are small deed in comparison with the issues that we face together--above all the somber threat now posed to the whole neighborhood of this continent--in fact, to the whole community of nations. But our alliance is born, not of fear, but of hope. It is an alliance that advances what we are for, as well as opposes what we are against.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it is that when we speak of our common attitudes and relationships, Canada and the United States speak in 1961 in terms of unity. We do not seek the unanimity that comes to those who water down all issues to the lowest common denominator--or to those who conceal their differences behind fixed smiles--or to those who measure unity by standards of popularity and affection, instead of trust and respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are allies. This is a partnership, not an empire. We are bound to have differences and disappointments--and we are equally bound to bring them out into the open, to settle them where they can be settled, and to respect each other's views when they cannot be settled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus ours is the unity of equal and independent nations, co-tenants of the same continent, heirs of the same legacy, and fully sovereign associates in the same historic endeavor: to preserve freedom for ourselves and all who wish it. To that endeavor we must bring great material and human resources, the result of separate cultures and independent economies. And above all, that endeavor requires a free and full exchange of new and different ideas on all issues and all undertakings.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor it is clear that no free nation can stand alone to meet the threat of those who make themselves our adversaries--that no free nation can retain any illusions about the nature of the threat--and that no free nation can remain indifferent to the steady erosion of freedom around the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is equally clear that no Western nation on its own can help those less-developed lands to fulfill their hopes for steady progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd finally, it is clear that in an age where new forces are asserting their strength around the globe--when the political shape of the hemispheres are changing rapidly-nothing is more vital than the unity of the United States and of Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so my friends of Canada, whatever problems may exist or arise between us, I can assure you that my associates and I will be ever ready to discuss them with you, and to take whatever steps we can to remove them. And whatever those problems may be, I can also assure you that they shrink in comparison with the great and awesome tasks that await us as free and peace-loving nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo let us fix our attention, not on those matters that vex us as neighbors, but on the issues that face us as leaders. Let us look southward as part of the Hemisphere with whose fate we are both inextricably bound. Let us look eastward as part of the North Atlantic Community upon whose strength and will so many depend. Let us look westward to Japan, to the newly emerging lands of Asia and Africa and the Middle East, where lie the people upon whose fate and choice the struggle for freedom may ultimately depend. And let us look at the world in which we live and hope to go on living--and at the way of life for which Canadians--and I was reminded again of this this morning, on my visit to your War Memorial--and Americans alike have always been willing to give up their lives in nearly every generation, if necessary to defend and preserve freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, if you will, consider our mutual hopes for this Hemisphere. Stretching virtually from Pole to Pole, the nations of the Western Hemisphere are bound together by the laws of economics as well as geography, by a common dedication to freedom as well as a common history of fighting for it. To make this entire area more secure against aggression of all kinds--to defend it against the encroachment of international communism in this Hemisphere--and to see our sister states fulfill their hopes and needs for economic and social reform and development-are surely all challenges confronting your nation, and deserving of your talents and resources, as well as ours.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure, it would mean an added responsibility; but yours is not a nation that shrinks from responsibility. The Hemisphere is a family into which we were born--and we cannot turn our backs on it in time of trouble. Nor can we stand aside from its great adventure of development. I believe that all of the free members of the Organization of American States would be heartened and strengthened by any increase in your Hemispheric role. Your skills, your resources, your judicious perception at the council table--even when it differs from our own view--are all needed throughout the inter-American Community. Your country and mine are partners in North American affairs--can we not now become partners in inter-American affairs?\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, let us consider our mutual hopes for the North Atlantic Community.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur NATO alliance is still, as it was when it was founded, the world's greatest bulwark of freedom. But the military balance of power has been changing. Enemy tactics and weaponry have been changing. We can stand still only at our peril.\\r\\n\\r\\nNATO force structures were originally devised to meet the threat of a massive conventional attack, in a period of Western nuclear monopoly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, if we are to meet the defense requirements of the 1960's, the NATO countries must push forward simultaneously along two lines:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, we must strengthen the conventional capability of our Alliance as a matter of the highest priority.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this end, we in the United States are taking steps to increase the strength and mobility of our forces and to modernize their equipment. To the same end, we will maintain our forces now on the European Continent and will increase their conventional capabilities. We look to our NATO Allies to assign an equally high priority to this same essential task.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, we must make certain that nuclear weapons will continue to be available for the defense of the entire Treaty area, and that these weapons are at all times under close and flexible political control that meets the needs of all the NATO countries. We are prepared to join our Allies in working out suitable arrangements for this purpose. To make clear our own intentions and commitments to the defense of-Western Europe, the United States will commit to the NATO command five--and subsequently still more--Polaris atomic-missile submarines, which are defensive weapons, subject to any agreed NATO guidelines on their control and use, and responsive to the needs of all members but still credible in an emergency. Beyond this, we look to the possibility of eventually establishing a NATO sea-borne force, which would be truly multi-lateral in ownership and control, if this should be desired and found feasible by our Allies, once NATO's non-nuclear goals have been achieved.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these measures--improved conventional forces and increased nuclear forces--are put forward in recognition of the fact that the defense of Europe and the assurances that can be given to the people of Europe and the defense of North America are indivisible--in the hope that no aggressor will mistake our desire for peace with our determination to respond instantly to any attack with whatever force is appropriate-and in the conviction that the time has come for all members of the NATO community to further increase and integrate their respective forces in the NATO command area, coordinating and sharing in research, development, production, storage, defense, command and training at all levels of armaments. So let us begin. Our opponents are watching to see if we in the West are divided. They take courage when we are. We must not let them be deceived or in doubt about our willingness to maintain our own freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, let us turn to the less-developed nations in the southern half of the globe-those who struggle to escape the bonds of mass misery which appeals to our hearts as well as to our hopes. Both your nation and mine have recognized our responsibilities to these new nations. Our people have given generously, if not always effectively. We could not do less. And now we must do more.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor our historic task in this embattled age is not merely to defend freedom. It is to extend its writ and strengthen its covenant-to peoples of different cultures and creeds and colors, whose policy or economic system may differ from ours, but whose desire to be free is no less fervent than our own. Through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Development Assistance Group, we can pool our vast resources and skills, and make available the kind of long-term capital, planning and know-how without which these nations will never achieve independent and viable economies, and without which our efforts will be tragically wasted. I propose further that the OECD establish a Development Center, where citizens and officials, and students and professional men of the Atlantic area and the less-developed world can meet to study in common the problems of economic development.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we in the Atlantic Community can more closely coordinate our own economic policies--and certainly the OECD provides the framework if we but use it, and I hope that you will join as we are seeking to join to use it--then surely our potential economic resources are adequate to meet our responsibility. Consider, for example, the unsurpassed productivity of our farms. Less than 8 percent of the American working force is on our farms; less than 11 percent of the Canadian working force is on yours. Fewer men on fewer acres than any nation on earth--but free men on free acres can produce here in North America all the food that a hungry world could use--while all the collective farms and forced labor of the communist system produce one shortage after another. This is a day-to-day miracle of our free societies, easy to forget at a time when our minds are caught up in the glamour of beginning the exploration of space.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the new nations emerge into independence, they face a choice: Shall they develop by the method of consent, or by turning their freedom over to the system of totalitarian control. In making that decision they should look long and hard at the tragedy now being played out in the villages of Communist China.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we can work closely together to make our food surpluses a blessing instead of a curse, no man, woman or child need go hungry. And if each of the more fortunate nations can bear its fair share of the effort to help the less-fortunate--not merely those with whom we have traditional ties, but all who are willing and able to achieve meaningful growth and dignity--then this decade will surely be a turning-point in the history of the human family.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, let me say just a few words about the world in which we live. We should not misjudge the force of the challenge that we face--a force that is powerful as well as insidious, that inspires dedication as well as fear, that uses means we cannot adopt to achieve ends we cannot permit.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor can we mistake the nature of the struggle. It is not for concessions or territory. It is not simply between different systems. It is an age old battle for the survival of liberty itself. And our great advantage-and we must never forget it--is that the irresistible tide that began five hundred years before the birth of Christ in ancient Greece is for freedom, and against tyranny. And that is the wave of the future--and the iron hand of totalitarianism can ultimately neither seize it nor turn it back. In the words of Macaulay: \\\"A single breaker may recede, but the tide is coming in.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we in the Free World are not without hope. We are not without friends. And we are not without resources to defend ourselves and those who are associated with us. Believing in the peaceful settlement of disputes in the defense of human rights, we are working throughout the United Nations, and through regional and other associations, to lessen the risks, the tensions and the means and opportunity for aggression that have been mounting so rapidly throughout the world. In these councils of peace--in the UN Emergency Force in the Middle East, in the Congo, in the International Control Commission in South East Asia, in the Ten Nations Commission on Disarmament-Canada has played a leading, important, and constructive role.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we can contain the powerful struggle of ideologies, and reduce it to manageable proportions, we can proceed with the transcendent task of disciplining the nuclear weapons which shadow our lives, and of finding a widened range of common enterprises between ourselves and those who live under communist rule. For, in the end, we live on one planet and we are part of one human family; and whatever the struggles that confront us, we must lose no chance to move forward towards a world of law and a world of disarmament.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the conference table and in the minds of men, the Free World's cause is strengthened because it is just. But it is strengthened even more by the dedicated efforts of free men and free nations. As the great parliamentarian Edmund Burke said, \\\"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\\\" And that in essence is why I am here today. This trip is more than a consultation--more than a good-will visit. It is an act of faith--faith in your country, in your leaders--faith in the capacity of two great neighbors to meet their common problems--and faith in the cause of freedom, in which we are so intimately associated.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F.

We are glad they are here with us, and we feel the musical future of this city and State is assured.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany things bring us together today. We are saluting the 90th anniversary of Vanderbilt University, which has grown from a small Tennessee university and institution to one of our Nation's greatest, with 7 different colleges, and with more than half of its 4200 students from outside of the State of Tennessee.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we are saluting the 30th anniversary of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which transformed a parched, depressed, and floodravaged region into a fertile, productive center of industry, science, and agriculture.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are saluting--by initiating construction of a dam in his name--a great Tennessee statesman, Cordell Hull, the father of reciprocal trade, the grandfather of the United Nations, the Secretary of State who presided over the transformation of this Nation from a life of isolation and almost indifference to a state of responsible world leadership.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd finally, we are saluting--by the recognition of a forthcoming dam in his name-J. Percy Priest, a former colleague of mine in the House of Representatives, who represented this district, this State, and this Nation in the Congress for 16 turbulent years--years which witnessed the crumbling of empires, the splitting of the atom, the conquest of one threat to freedom, and the emergence of still another.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there is one unchanging theme that runs throughout these separate stories, it is that everything changes but change itself. We live in an age of movement and change, both evolutionary and revolutionary, both good and evil--and in such an age a university has a special obligation to hold fast to the best of the past and move fast to the best of the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly 100 years ago Prince Bismarck said that one-third of the students of German universities broke down from overwork, another third broke down from dissipation, and the other third ruled Germany. I do not know which third of the student body of Vanderbilt is here today, but I am confident we are talking to the future rulers of Tennessee and America in the spirit of this university.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe essence of Vanderbilt is still learning, the essence of its outlook is still liberty, and liberty and learning will be and must be the touchstones of Vanderbilt University and of any free university in this country or the world. I say two touchstones, yet they are almost inseparable, inseparable if not indistinguishable, for liberty without learning is always in peril, and learning without liberty is always in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis State, this city, this campus, have stood long for both human rights and human enlightenment--and let that forever be true. This Nation is now engaged in a continuing debate about the rights of a portion of its citizens. That will go on, and those rights will expand until the standard first forged by the Nation's founders has been reached, and all Americans enjoy equal opportunity and liberty under law.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this Nation was not founded solely on the principle of citizens' rights. Equally important, though too often not discussed, is the citizen's responsibility. For our privileges can be no greater than our obligations. The protection of our rights can endure no longer than the performance of our responsibilities. Each can be neglected only at the peril of the other. I speak to you today, therefore, not of your rights as Americans, but of your responsibilities. They are many in number and different in nature. They do not rest with equal weight upon the shoulders of all. Equality of opportunity does not mean equality of responsibility. All Americans must be responsible citizens, but some must be more responsible than others, by virtue of their public or their private position, their role in the family or community, their prospects for the future, or their legacy from the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreased responsibility goes with increased ability, for \\\"of those to whom much is given, much is required.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCommodore Vanderbilt recognized this responsibility and his recognition made possible the establishment of a great institution of learning for which he will be long remembered after his steamboats and railroads have been forgotten. I speak in particular, therefore, of the responsibility of the educated citizen, including the students, the faculty, and the alumni of this great institution. The creation and maintenance of Vanderbilt University, like that of all great universities, has required considerable effort and expenditure, and I cannot believe that all of this was undertaken merely to give this school's graduates an economic advantage in the life struggle. \\\"Every man sent out from a university,\\\" said Professor Woodrow Wilson, \\\"Every man sent out from a university should be a man of his Nation, as well as a man of his time.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have responsibilities, in short, to use your talents for the benefit of the society which helped develop those talents. You must decide, as Goethe put it, whether you will be an anvil or a hammer, whether you will give to the world in which you were reared and educated the broadest possible benefits of that education. Of the many special obligations incumbent upon an educated citizen, I would cite three as outstanding: your obligation to the pursuit of learning, your obligation to serve the public, your obligation to uphold the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the pursuit of learning is not defended by the educated citizen, it will not be defended at all. For there will always be those who scoff at intellectuals, who cry out against research, who seek to limit our educational system. Modern cynics and skeptics see no more reason for landing a man on the moon, which we shall do, than the cynics and skeptics of half a millennium ago saw for the discovery of this country. They see no harm in paying those to whom they entrust the minds of their children a smaller wage than is paid to those to whom they entrust the care of their plumbing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the educated citizen knows how much more there is to know. He knows that \\\"knowledge is power,\\\" more so today than ever before. He knows that only an educated and informed people will be a free people, that the ignorance of one voter in a democracy impairs the security of all, and that if we can, as Jefferson put it, \\\"enlighten the people generally ... tyranny and the oppressions of mind and body will vanish, like evil spirits at the dawn of day.\\\" And, therefore, the educated citizen has a special obligation to encourage the pursuit of learning, to promote exploration of the unknown, to preserve the freedom of inquiry, to support the advancement of research, and to assist at every level of government the improvement of education for all Americans, from grade school to graduate school.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, the educated citizen has an obligation to serve the public. He may be a precinct worker or President. He may give his talents at the courthouse, the State house, the White House. He may be a civil servant or a Senator, a candidate or a campaign worker, a winner or a loser. But he must be a participant and not a spectator.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"At the Olympic games,\\\" Aristotle wrote, \\\"it is not the finest and strongest men who are crowned, but they who enter the lists-for out of these the prize-men are elected. So, too, in life, of the honorable and the good, it is they who act who rightly win the prizes.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI urge all of you today, especially those who are students, to act, to enter the lists of public service and rightly win or lose the prize. For we can have only one form of aristocracy in this country, as Jefferson wrote long ago in rejecting John Adams' suggestion of an artificial aristocracy of wealth and birth. It is, he wrote, the natural aristocracy of character and talent, and the best form of government, he added, was that which selected these men for positions of responsibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would hope that all educated citizens would fulfill this obligation--in politics, in Government, here in Nashville, here in this State, in the Peace Corps, in the Foreign Service, in the Government Service, in the Tennessee Valley, in the world. You will find the pressures greater than the pay. You may endure more public attacks than support. But you will have the unequaled satisfaction of knowing that your character and talent are contributing to the direction and success of this free society.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, and finally, the educated citizen has an obligation to uphold the law. This is the obligation of every citizen in a free and peaceful society--but the educated citizen has a special responsibility by the virtue of his greater understanding. For whether he has ever studied history or current events, ethics or civics, the rules of a profession or the tools of a trade, he knows that only a respect for the law makes it possible for free men to dwell together in peace and progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knows that law is the adhesive force in the cement of society, creating order out of chaos and coherence in place of anarchy. He knows that for one man to defy a law or court order he does not like is to invite others to defy those which they do not like, leading to a breakdown of all justice and all order. He knows, too, that every fellowman is entitled to be regarded with decency and treated with dignity. Any educated citizen who seeks to subvert the law, to suppress freedom, or to subject other human beings to acts that are less than human, degrades his heritage, ignores his learning, and betrays his obligation.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain other societies may respect the rule of force--we respect the rule of law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nation, indeed the whole world, has watched recent events in the United States with alarm and dismay. No one can deny the complexity of the problems involved in assuring to all of our citizens their full fights as Americans. But no one can gainsay the fact that the determination to secure these rights is in the highest traditions of American freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these moments of tragic disorder, a special burden rests on the educated men and women of our country to reject the temptations of prejudice and violence, and to reaffirm the values of freedom and law on which our free society depends.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Bishop McTyeire, 90 years ago, proposed it to Commodore Vanderbilt, he said, \\\"Commodore, our country has been torn to pieces by a civil war .... We want to repair this damage.\\\" And Commodore Vanderbilt reportedly replied, \\\"I want to unite this country, and all sections of it, so that all our people will be one.\\\" His response, his recognition of his obligation and opportunity gave Vanderbilt University not only an endowment but also a mission. Now, 90 years later, in a time of tension, it is more important than ever to unite this country and strengthen these ties so that all of our people will be one.\\r\\n\\r\\nNinety years from now I have no doubt that Vanderbilt University will still be fulfilling this mission. It will still uphold learning, encourage public service, and teach respect for the law. It will neither turn its back on proven wisdom or turn its face from newborn challenge. It will still pass on to the youth of our land the full meaning of their rights and their responsibilities. And it will still be teaching the truth--the truth that makes us free and will keep us free. Thank you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"May 18, 1963: 90th Anniversary of Vanderbilt University\"},{\"doc_name\":\"may-25-1961-goal-sending-man-moon\",\"date\":\"1961-05-25\",\"transcript\":\"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, my copartners in Government, gentlemen and ladies:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution imposes upon me the obligation to \\\"from time to time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union.\\\" While this has traditionally been interpreted as an annual affair, this tradition has been broken in extraordinary times.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are extraordinary times. And we face an extraordinary challenge. Our strength as well as our convictions have imposed upon this nation the role of leader in freedom's cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo role in history could be more difficult or more important. We stand for freedom. That is our conviction for ourselves—that is our only commitment to others. No friend, no neutral and no adversary should think otherwise. We are not against any man—or any nation—or any system—except as it is hostile to freedom. Nor am I here to present a new military doctrine, bearing any one name or aimed at any one area. I am here to promote the freedom doctrine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great battleground for the defense and expansion of freedom today is the whole southern half of the globe—Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East—the lands of the rising peoples. Their revolution is the greatest in human history. They seek an end to injustice, tyranny, and exploitation. More than an end, they seek a beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd theirs is a revolution which we would support regardless of the Cold War, and regardless of which political or economic route they should choose to freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the adversaries of freedom did not create the revolution; nor did they create the conditions which compel it. But they are seeking to ride the crest of its wave—to capture it for themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet their aggression is more often concealed than open. They have fired no missiles; and their troops are seldom seen. They send arms, agitators, aid, technicians and propaganda to every troubled area. But where fighting is required, it is usually done by others—by guerrillas striking at night, by assassins striking alone—assassins who have taken the lives of four thousand civil officers in the last twelve months in Vietnam alone—by subversives and saboteurs and insurrectionists, who in some cases control whole areas inside of independent nations.1\\r\\n\\r\\n1 At this point the following paragraph, which appears in fine text as signed and transmitted to the Senate and House of Representatives, was omitted in the reading of the message:\\r\\n\\r\\nThey possess a powerful intercontinental striking force, large forces for conventional war, a well-trained underground in nearly every country, the power to conscript talent and manpower for any purpose, the capacity for quick decisions, a closed society without dissent or free information, and long experience in the techniques of violence and subversion. They make the most of their scientific successes, their economic progress and their pose as a foe of colonialism and friend of popular revolution. They prey on unstable or unpopular governments, unsealed, or unknown boundaries, unfilled hopes, convulsive change, massive poverty, illiteracy, unrest and frustration.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these formidable weapons, the adversaries of freedom plan to consolidate their territory—to exploit, to control, and finally to destroy the hopes of the world's newest nations; and they have ambition to do it before the end of this decade. It is a contest of will and purpose as well as force and violence—a battle for minds and souls as well as lives and territory. And in that contest, we cannot stand aside.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stand, as we have always stood from our earliest beginnings, for the independence and equality of all nations. This nation was born of revolution and raised in freedom. And we do not intend to leave an open road for despotism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no single simple policy which meets this challenge. Experience has taught us that no one nation has the power or the wisdom to solve all the problems of the world or manage its revolutionary tides—that extending our commitments does not always increase our security—that any initiative carries with it the risk of a temporary defeat—that nuclear weapons cannot prevent subversion—that no free people can be kept free without will and energy of their own—and that no two nations or situations are exactly alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet there is much we can do—and must do. The proposals I bring before you are numerous and varied. They arise from the host of special opportunities and dangers which have become increasingly clear in recent months. Taken together, I believe that they can mark another step forward in our effort as a people. I am here to ask the help of this Congress and the nation in approving these necessary measures.\\r\\n\\r\\nII. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS AT HOME\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first and basic task confronting this nation this year was to turn recession into recovery. An affirmative anti-recession program, initiated with your cooperation, supported the natural forces in the private sector; and our economy is now enjoying renewed confidence and energy. The recession has been halted. Recovery is under way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the task of abating unemployment and achieving a full use of our resources does remain a serious challenge for us all. Large-scale unemployment during a recession is bad enough, but large-scale unemployment during a period of prosperity would be intolerable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am therefore transmitting to the Congress a new Manpower Development and Training program, to train or retrain several hundred thousand workers, particularly in those areas where we have seen chronic unemployment as a result of technological factors in new occupational skills over a four-year period, in order to replace those skills made obsolete by automation and industrial change with the new skills which the new processes demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be a satisfaction to us all that we have made great strides in restoring world confidence in the dollar, halting the outflow of gold and improving our balance of payments. During the last two months, our gold stocks actually increased by seventeen million dollars, compared to a loss of 635 million dollars during the last two months of 1960. We must maintain this progress—and this will require the cooperation and restraint of everyone. As recovery progresses, there will be temptations to seek unjustified price and wage increases. These we cannot afford. They will only handicap our efforts to compete abroad and to achieve full recovery here at home. Labor and management must—and I am confident that they will—pursue responsible wage and price policies in these critical times. I look to the President's Advisory Committee on Labor-Management Policy to give a strong lead in this direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, if the budget deficit now increased by the needs of our security is to be held within manageable proportions, it will be necessary to hold tightly to prudent fiscal standards; and I request the cooperation of the Congress in this regard—to refrain from adding funds or programs, desirable as they may be, to the Budget—to end the postal deficit, as my predecessor also recommended, through increased rates—a deficit incidentally, this year, which exceeds the fiscal 1962 cost of all the space and defense measures that I am submitting today—to provide full pay-as-you-go highway financing—and to close those tax loopholes earlier specified. Our security and progress cannot be cheaply purchased; and their price must be found in what we all forego as well as what we all must pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS ABROAD\\r\\n\\r\\nI stress the strength of our economy because it is essential to the strength of our nation. And what is true in our case is true in the case of other countries. Their strength in the struggle for freedom depends on the strength of their economic and their social progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe would be badly mistaken to consider their problems in military terms alone. For no amount of arms and armies can help stabilize those governments which are unable or unwilling to achieve social and economic reform and development. Military pacts cannot help nations whose social injustice and economic chaos invite insurgency and penetration and subversion. The most skillful counter-guerrilla efforts cannot succeed where the local population is too caught up in its own misery to be concerned about the advance of communism.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut for those who share this view, we stand ready now, as we have in the past, to provide generously of our skills, and our capital, and our food to assist the peoples of the less-developed nations to reach their goals in freedom—to help them before they are engulfed in crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is also our great opportunity in 1961. If we grasp it, then subversion to prevent its success is exposed as an unjustifiable attempt to keep these nations from either being free or equal. But if we do not pursue it, and if they do not pursue it, the bankruptcy of unstable governments, one by one, and of unfilled hopes will surely lead to a series of totalitarian receiverships.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier in the year, I outlined to the Congress a new program for aiding emerging nations; and it is my intention to transmit shortly draft legislation to implement this program, to establish a new Act for International Development, and to add to the figures previously requested, in view of the swift pace of critical events, an additional 250 million dollars for a Presidential Contingency Fund, to be used only upon a Presidential determination in each case, with regular and complete reports to the Congress in each case, when there is a sudden and extraordinary drain upon our regular funds which we cannot foresee—as illustrated by recent events in Southeast Asia—and it makes necessary the use of this emergency reserve. The total amount requested—now raised to 2.65 billion dollars—is both minimal and crucial. I do not see how anyone who is concerned—as we all are—about the growing threats to freedom around the globe—and who is asking what more we can do as a people—can weaken or oppose the single most important program available for building the frontiers of freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that I have said makes it clear that we are engaged in a world-wide struggle in which we bear a heavy burden to preserve and promote the ideals that we share with all mankind, or have alien ideals forced upon them. That struggle has highlighted the role of our Information Agency. It is essential that the funds previously requested for this effort be not only approved in full, but increased by 2 million, 400 thousand dollars, to a total of 121 million dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis new request is for additional radio and television to Latin America and Southeast Asia. These tools are particularly effective and essential in the cities and villages of those great continents as a means of reaching millions of uncertain peoples to tell them of our interest in their fight for freedom. In Latin America, we are proposing to increase our Spanish and Portuguese broadcasts to a total of 154 hours a week, compared to 42 hours today, none of which is in Portuguese, the language of about one-third of the people of South America. The Soviets, Red Chinese and satellites already broadcast into Latin America more than 134 hours a week in Spanish and Portuguese. Communist China alone does more public information broadcasting in our own hemisphere than we do. Moreover, powerful propaganda broadcasts from Havana now are heard throughout Latin America, encouraging new revolutions in several countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, in Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand, we must communicate our determination and support to those upon whom our hopes for resisting the communist tide in that continent ultimately depend. Our interest is in the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nV. OUR PARTNERSHIP FOR SELF-DEFENSE\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while we talk of sharing and building and the competition of ideas, others talk of arms and threaten war. So we have learned to keep our defenses strong—and to cooperate with others in a partnership of self-defense. The events of recent weeks have caused us to look anew at these efforts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe center of freedom's defense is our network of world alliances, extending from NATO, recommended by a Democratic President and approved by a Republican Congress, to SEATO, recommended by a Republican President and approved by a Democratic Congress. These alliances were constructed in the 1940's and 1950's—it is our task and responsibility in the 1960's to strengthen them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo meet the changing conditions of power—and power relationships have changed—we have endorsed an increased emphasis on NATO's conventional strength. At the same time we are affirming our conviction that the NATO nuclear deterrent must also be kept strong. I have made clear our intention to commit to the NATO command, for this purpose, the 5 Polaris submarines originally suggested by President Eisenhower, with the possibility, if needed, of more to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, a major part of our partnership for self-defense is the Military Assistance Program. The main burden of local defense against local attack, subversion, insurrection or guerrilla warfare must of necessity rest with local forces. Where these forces have the necessary will and capacity to cope with such threats, our intervention is rarely necessary or helpful. Where the will is present and only capacity is lacking, our Military Assistance Program can be of help.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this program, like economic assistance, needs a new emphasis. It cannot be extended without regard to the social, political and military reforms essential to internal respect and stability. The equipment and training provided must be tailored to legitimate local needs and to our own foreign and military policies, not to our supply of military stocks or a local leader's desire for military display. And military assistance can, in addition to its military purposes, make a contribution to economic progress, as do our own Army Engineers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an earlier message, I requested 1.6 billion dollars for Military Assistance, stating that this would maintain existing force levels, but that I could not foresee how much more might be required. It is now clear that this is not enough. The present crisis in Southeast Asia, on which the Vice President has made a valuable report—the rising threat of communism in Latin America-the increased arms traffic in Africa—and all the new pressures on every nation found on the map by tracing your fingers along the borders of the Communist bloc in Asia and the Middle East—all make clear the dimension of our needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore request the Congress to provide a total of 1.885 billion dollars for Military Assistance in the coming fiscal year—an amount less than that requested a year ago—but a minimum which must be assured if we are to help those nations make secure their independence. This must be prudently and wisely spent—and that will be our common endeavor. Military and economic assistance has been a heavy burden on our citizens for a long time, and I recognize the strong pressures against it; but this battle is far from over, it is reaching a crucial stage, and I believe we should participate in it. We cannot merely state our opposition to totalitarian advance without paying the price of helping those now under the greatest pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nVI. OUR OWN MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE\\r\\n\\r\\nIn line with these developments, I have directed a further reinforcement of our own capacity to deter or resist non-nuclear aggression. In the conventional field, with one exception, I find no present need for large new levies of men. What is needed is rather a change of position to give us still further increases in flexibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, I am directing the Secretary of Defense to undertake a reorganization and modernization of the Army's divisional structure, to increase its non-nuclear firepower, to improve its tactical mobility in any environment, to insure its flexibility to meet any direct or indirect threat, to facilitate its coordination with our major allies, and to provide more modern mechanized divisions in Europe and bring their equipment up to date, and new airborne brigades in both the Pacific and Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd secondly, I am asking the Congress for an additional 100 million dollars to begin the procurement task necessary to re-equip this new Army structure with the most modern material. New helicopters, new armored personnel carriers, and new howitzers, for example, must be obtained now.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, I am directing the Secretary of Defense to expand rapidly and substantially, in cooperation with our Allies, the orientation of existing forces for the conduct of nonnuclear war, para-military operations and sub-limited or unconventional wars.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, our special forces and unconventional warfare units will be increased and reoriented. Throughout the services new emphasis must be placed on the special skills and languages which are required to work with local populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth, the Army is developing plans to make possible a much more rapid deployment of a major portion of its highly trained reserve forces. When these plans are completed and the reserve is strengthened, two combat-equipped divisions, plus their supporting forces, a total of 89,000 men, could be ready in an emergency for operations with but 3 weeks notice—2 more divisions with but 5 weeks notice—and six additional divisions and their supporting forces, making a total of 10 divisions, could be deployable with less than 8 weeks' notice. In short, these new plans will allow us to almost double the combat power of the Army in less than two months, compared to the nearly nine months heretofore required.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth, to enhance the already formidable ability of the Marine Corps to respond to limited war emergencies, I am asking the Congress for 60 million dollars to increase the Marine Corps strength to 190,000 men. This will increase the initial impact and staying power of our three Marine divisions and three air wings, and provide a trained nucleus for further expansion, if necessary for self-defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, to cite one other area of activities that are both legitimate and necessary as a means of self-defense in an age of hidden perils, our whole intelligence effort must be reviewed, and its coordination with other elements of policy assured. The Congress and the American people are entitled to know that we will institute whatever new organization, policies, and control are necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nVII. CIVIL DEFENSE\\r\\n\\r\\nOne major element of the national security program which this nation has never squarely faced up to is civil defense. This problem arises not from present trends but from national inaction in which most of us have participated. In the past decade we have intermittently considered a variety of programs, but we have never adopted a consistent policy. Public considerations have been largely characterized by apathy, indifference and skepticism; while, at the same time, many of the civil defense plans have been so far-reaching and unrealistic that they have not gained essential support.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Administration has been looking hard at exactly what civil defense can and cannot do. It cannot be obtained cheaply. It cannot give an assurance of blast protection that will be proof against surprise attack or guaranteed against obsolescence or destruction. And it cannot deter a nuclear attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will deter an enemy from making a nuclear attack only if our retaliatory power is so strong and so invulnerable that he knows he would be destroyed by our response. If we have that strength, civil defense is not needed to deter an attack. If we should ever lack it, civil defense would not be an adequate substitute.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this deterrent concept assumes rational calculations by rational men. And the history of this planet, and particularly the history of the 20th century, is sufficient to remind us of the possibilities of an irrational attack, a miscalculation, an accidental war, for a war of escalation in which the stakes by each side gradually increase to the point of maximum danger which cannot be either foreseen or deterred. It is on this basis that civil defense can be readily justifiable—as insurance for the civilian population in case of an enemy miscalculation. It is insurance we trust will never be needed—but insurance which we could never forgive ourselves for foregoing in the event of catastrophe.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the validity of this concept is recognized, there is no point in delaying the initiation of a nation-wide long-range program of identifying present fallout shelter capacity and providing shelter in new and existing structures. Such a program would protect millions of people against the hazards of radioactive fallout in the event of large-scale nuclear attack. Effective performance of the entire program not only requires new legislative authority and more funds, but also sound organizational arrangements.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, under the authority vested in me by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958, I am assigning responsibility for this program to the top civilian authority already responsible for continental defense, the Secretary of Defense. It is important that this function remain civilian, in nature and leadership; and this feature will not be changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization will be reconstituted as a small staff agency to assist in the coordination of these functions. To more accurately describe its role, its title should be changed to the Office of Emergency Planning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as those newly charged with these responsibilities have prepared new authorization and appropriation requests, such requests will be transmitted to the Congress for a much strengthened Federal-State civil defense program. Such a program will provide Federal funds for identifying fallout shelter capacity in existing structures, and it will include, where appropriate, incorporation of shelter in Federal buildings, new requirements for shelter in buildings constructed with Federal assistance, and matching grants and other incentives for constructing shelter in State and local and private buildings.\\r\\n\\r\\nFederal appropriations for civil defense in fiscal 1962 under this program will in all likelihood be more than triple the pending budget requests; and they will increase sharply in subsequent years. Financial participation will also be required from State and local governments and from private citizens. But no insurance is cost-free; and every American citizen and his community must decide for themselves whether this form of survival insurance justifies the expenditure of effort, time and money. For myself, I am convinced that it does.\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII. DISARMAMENT\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot end this discussion of defense and armaments without emphasizing our strongest hope: the creation of an orderly world where disarmament will be possible. Our aims do not prepare for war—they are efforts to discourage and resist the adventures of others that could end in war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is why it is consistent with these efforts that we continue to press for properly safeguarded disarmament measures. At Geneva, in cooperation with the United Kingdom, we have put forward concrete proposals to make clear our wish to meet the Soviets half way in an effective nuclear test ban treaty—the first significant but essential step on the road towards disarmament. Up to now, their response has not been what we hoped, but Mr. Dean returned last night to Geneva, and we intend to go the last mile in patience to secure this gain if we can.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, we are determined to keep disarmament high on our agenda—to make an intensified effort to develop acceptable political and technical alternatives to the present arms race. To this end I shall send to the Congress a measure to establish a strengthened and enlarged Disarmament Agency.\\r\\n\\r\\nIX. SPACE\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, if we are to win the battle that is now going on around the world between freedom and tyranny, the dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all, as did the Sputnik in 1957, the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere, who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take. Since early in my term, our efforts in space have been under review. With the advice of the Vice President, who is Chairman of the National Space Council, we have examined where we are strong and where we are not, where we may succeed and where we may not. Now it is time to take longer strides—time for a great new American enterprise—time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe we possess all the resources and talents necessary. But the facts of the matter are that we have never made the national decisions or marshaled the national resources required for such leadership. We have never specified long-range goals on an urgent time schedule, or managed our resources and our time so as to insure their fulfillment.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecognizing the head start obtained by the Soviets with their large rocket engines, which gives them many months of lead-time, and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit this lead for some time to come in still more impressive successes, we nevertheless are required to make new efforts on our own. For while we cannot guarantee that we shall one day be first, we can guarantee that any failure to make this effort will make us last. We take an additional risk by making it in full view of the world, but as shown by the feat of astronaut Shepard, this very risk enhances our stature when we are successful. But this is not merely a race. Space is open to us now; and our eagerness to share its meaning is not governed by the efforts of others. We go into space because whatever mankind must undertake, free men must fully share.\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore ask the Congress, above and beyond the increases I have earlier requested for space activities, to provide the funds which are needed to meet the following national goals:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft. We propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters, much larger than any now being developed, until certain which is superior. We propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorations—explorations which are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the moon—if we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, an additional 23 million dollars, together with 7 million dollars already available, will accelerate development of the Rover nuclear rocket. This gives promise of some day providing a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space, perhaps beyond the moon, perhaps to the very end of the solar system itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, an additional 50 million dollars will make the most of our present leadership, by accelerating the use of space satellites for world-wide communications.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth, an additional 75 million dollars—of which 53 million dollars is for the Weather Bureau—will help give us at the earliest possible time a satellite system for world-wide weather observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet it be clear—and this is a judgment which the Members of the Congress must finally make—let it be clear that I am asking the Congress and the country to accept a firm commitment to a new course of action—a course which will last for many years and carry very heavy costs: 531 million dollars in fiscal '62—an estimated seven to nine billion dollars additional over the next five years. If we are to go only half way, or reduce our sights in the face of difficulty, in my judgment it would be better not to go at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow this is a choice which this country must make, and I am confident that under the leadership of the Space Committees of the Congress, and the Appropriating Committees, that you will consider the matter carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a most important decision that we make as a nation. But all of you have lived through the last four years and have seen the significance of space and the adventures in space, and no one can predict with certainty what the ultimate meaning will be of mastery of space.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe we should go to the moon. But I think every citizen of this country as well as the Members of the Congress should consider the matter carefully in making their judgment, to which we have given attention over many weeks and months, because it is a heavy burden, and there is no sense in agreeing or desiring that the United States take an affirmative position in outer space, unless we are prepared to do the work and bear the burdens to make it successful. If we are not, we should decide today and this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis decision demands a major national commitment of scientific and technical manpower, materiel and facilities, and the possibility of their diversion from other important activities where they are already thinly spread. It means a degree of dedication, organization and discipline which have not always characterized our research and development efforts. It means we cannot afford undue work stoppages, inflated costs of material or talent, wasteful interagency rivalries, or a high turnover of key personnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew objectives and new money cannot solve these problems. They could in fact, aggravate them further—unless every scientist, every engineer, every serviceman, every technician, contractor, and civil servant gives his personal pledge that this nation will move forward, with the full speed of freedom, in the exciting adventure of space.\\r\\n\\r\\nX. CONCLUSION\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, let me emphasize one point. It is not a pleasure for any President of the United States, as I am sure it was not a pleasure for my predecessors, to come before the Congress and ask for new appropriations which place burdens on our people. I came to this conclusion with some reluctance. But in my judgment, this is a most serious time in the life of our country and in the life of freedom around the globe, and it is the obligation, I believe, of the President of the United States to at least make his recommendations to the Members of the Congress, so that they can reach their own conclusions with that judgment before them. You must decide yourselves, as I have decided, and I am confident that whether you finally decide in the way that I have decided or not, that your judgment—as my judgment—is reached on what is in the best interests of our country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, let me emphasize one point: that we are determined, as a nation in 1961 that freedom shall survive and succeed—and whatever the peril and set-backs, we have some very large advantages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first is the simple fact that we are on the side of liberty—and since the beginning of history, and particularly since the end of the Second World War, liberty has been winning out all over the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nA second great asset is that we are not alone. We have friends and allies all over the world who share our devotion to freedom. May I cite as a symbol of traditional and effective friendship the great ally I am about to visit—France. I look forward to my visit to France, and to my discussion with a great Captain of the Western World, President de Gaulle, as a meeting of particular significance, permitting the kind of close and ranging consultation that will strengthen both our countries and serve the common purposes of world-wide peace and liberty. Such serious conversations do not require a pale unanimity—they are rather the instruments of trust and understanding over a long road.\\r\\n\\r\\nA third asset is our desire for peace. It is sincere, and I believe the world knows it. We are proving it in our patience at the test-ban table, and we are proving it in the UN where our efforts have been directed to maintaining that organization's usefulness as a protector of the independence of small nations. In these and other instances, the response of our opponents has not been encouraging.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet it is important to know that our patience at the bargaining table is nearly inexhaustible, though our credulity is limited—that our hopes for peace are unfailing, while our determination to protect our security is resolute. For these reasons I have long thought it wise to meet with the Soviet Premier for a personal exchange of views. A meeting in Vienna turned out to be convenient for us both; and the Austrian government has kindly made us welcome. No formal agenda is planned and no negotiations will be undertaken; but we will make dear America's enduring concern is for both peace and freedom—that we are anxious to live in harmony with the Russian people—that we seek no conquests, no satellites, no riches—that we seek only the day when \\\"nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, our greatest asset in this struggle is the American people—their willingness to pay the price for these programs—to understand and accept a long struggle—to share their resources with other less fortunate people—to meet the tax levels and close the tax loopholes I have requested—to exercise self-restraint instead of pushing up wages or prices, or over-producing certain crops, or spreading military secrets, or urging unessential expenditures or improper monopolies or harmful work stoppages—to serve in the Peace Corps or the Armed Services or the Federal Civil Service or the Congress—to strive for excellence in their schools, in their cities and in their physical fitness and that of their children—to take part in Civil Defense—to pay higher postal rates, and higher payroll taxes and higher teachers' salaries, in order to strengthen our society—to show friendship to students and visitors from other lands who visit us and go back in many cases to be the future leaders, with an image of America—and I want that image, and I know you do, to be affirmative and positive—and, finally, to practice democracy at home, in all States, with all races, to respect each other and to protect the Constitutional rights of all citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not asked for a single program which did not cause one or all Americans some inconvenience, or some hardship, or some sacrifice. But they have responded—and you in the Congress have responded to your duty—and I feel confident in asking today for a similar response to these new and larger demands. It is heartening to know, as I journey abroad, that our country is united in its commitment to freedom—and is ready to do its duty.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F.

My wife beat me to this honor by about 8 or 9 years. It took her 2 years to get this degree and it took me 2 minutes, but in any case we are both grateful.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am also glad to be here because this University bears the distinguished name of the father of our country, George Washington. It is a matter of great interest that there has been an intimate relationship between the great political leaders of our country and our colleges and universities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis University bears the name of George Washington, which showed his understanding in his day of the necessity of a free society to produce educated men and women. John Adams and John Quincy Adams from my own State of Massachusetts had an intimate relationship with Harvard University. Both of them, I believe, were members of the board of overseers. In both of their lives, Harvard and its development played a major part.\\r\\n\\r\\nWashington and Lee shows an intimate relationship, for General Lee, the fact that he was willing to devote his life at the end of the war to educating the men and women of the South, indicated his understanding of this basic precept. Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt--and all the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't think that there has ever been a time when we have had greater need for those qualities which a university produces. I know that many people feel that a democracy is a divided system, that where the Communists are certain in purpose and certain in execution, we debate and talk and are unable to meet their consistency and their perseverance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not hold that view. There are many disadvantages which a free society bears with it in a cold war struggle, but I believe over the long run that people do want to be free, that they desire to develop their own personalities and their own potentials, that democracy permits them to do so. And that it is the job of schools and colleges such as this to provide the men and women who will with their sense of discipline and purpose and understanding contribute to the maintenance of free societies here and around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hundred years ago, George William Curtis of my own State asked a body of educators during the Kansas-Nebraska controversy, \\\"Would you have counted him a friend of ancient Greece who quietly discussed the theory of patriotism on that hot summer day through whose hopeless and immortal hours Leonidas and the three hundred stood at Thermopylae for liberty? Was John Milton to conjugate Greek verbs in his library when the liberty of Englishmen was imperiled?\\\" No, quite obviously, the duty of the educated man or woman, the duty of the scholar, is to give his objective sense, his sense of liberty to the maintenance of our society at a critical time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is our opportunity, as well as our responsibility; and I am particularly glad to be here today when we are witnessing the swearing-in of a new President. Many years ago, as most of you know, at Harvard University somebody came around and asked for President Lowell. They said, \\\"He's in Washington seeing Mr. Taft.\\\" I know that some other day, when they are asking for the President of your University, they will say that he is over at the White House seeing Mr. Kennedy.\\r\\nThey understood at Harvard, and you understood here, the relative importance of a University President and a President of the United States.\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F.

But I think it most appropriate that we recall on this occasion, and on every other moment when we are faced with great responsibilities, the contribution and the sacrifice which so many men and their families have made in order to permit this country to now occupy its present position of responsibility and freedom, and in order to permit us to gather here together.\\r\\n\\r\\nBruce Catton, after totaling the casualties which took place in the battle of Antietam, not so very far from this cemetery, when he looked at statistics which showed that in the short space of a few minutes whole regiments lost 50 to 75 percent of their numbers, then wrote that life perhaps isn't the most precious gift of all, that men died for the possession of a few feet of a corn field or a rocky hill, or for almost nothing at all. But in a very larger sense, they died that this country might be permitted to go on, and that it might permit to be fulfilled the great hopes of its founders.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a world tormented by tension and the possibilities of conflict, we meet in a quiet commemoration of an historic day of peace. In an age that threatens the survival of freedom, we join together to honor those who made our freedom possible. The resolution of the Congress which first proclaimed Armistice Day, described November 11, 1918, as the end of \\\"the most destructive, sanguinary and far-reaching war in the history of human annals.\\\" That resolution expressed the hope that the First World War would be, in truth, the war to end all wars. It suggested that those men who had died had therefore not given their lives in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a tragic fact that these hopes have not been fulfilled, that wars still more destructive and still more sanguinary followed, that man's capacity to devise new ways of killing his fellow men have far outstripped his capacity to live in peace with his fellow men.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome might say, therefore, that this day has lost its meaning, that the shadow of the new and deadly weapons have robbed this day of its great value, that whatever name we now give this day, whatever flags we fly or prayers we utter, it is too late to honor those who died before, and too soon to promise the living an end to organized death.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut let us not forget that November 11, 1918, signified a beginning, as well as an end. \\\"The purpose of all war,\\\" said Augustine, \\\"is peace.\\\" The First World War produced man's first great effort in recent times to solve by international cooperation the problems of war. That experiment continues in our present day--still imperfect, still short of its responsibilities, but it does offer a hope that some day nations can live in harmony.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor our part, we shall achieve that peace only with patience and perseverance and courage--the patience and perseverance necessary to work with allies of diverse interests but common goals, the courage necessary over a long period of time to overcome an adversary skilled in the arts of harassment and obstruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no way to maintain the frontiers of freedom without cost and commitment and risk. There is no swift and easy path to peace in our generation. No man who witnessed the tragedies of the last war, no man who can imagine the unimaginable possibilities of the next war, can advocate war out of irritability or frustration or impatience.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut let no nation confuse our perseverance and patience with fear of war or unwillingness to meet our responsibilities. We cannot save ourselves by abandoning those who are associated with us, or rejecting our responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, the only way to maintain the peace is to be prepared in the final extreme to fight for our country--and to mean it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a nation, we have little capacity for deception. We can convince friend and foe alike that we are in earnest about the defense of freedom only if we are in earnest-and I can assure the world that we are.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cemetery was first established 97 years ago. In this hill were first buried men who died in an earlier war, a savage war here in our own country. Ninety-seven years ago today, the men in Gray were retiring from Antietam, where thousands of their comrades had fallen between dawn and dusk in one terrible day. And the men in Blue were moving towards Fredericksburg, where thousands would soon lie by a stone wall in heroic and sometimes miserable death.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a crucial moment in our Nation's history, but these memories, sad and proud, these quiet grounds, this Cemetery and others like it all around the world, remind us with pride of our obligation and our opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this Veterans Day of 1961, on this day of remembrance, let us pray in the name of those who have fought in this country's wars, and most especially who have fought in the First World War and in the Second World War, that there will be no veterans of any further war--not because all shall have perished but because all shall have learned to live together in peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to the dead here in this cemetery we say:\\r\\nThey are the race--\\r\\n\\r\\nthey are the race immortal,\\r\\nWhose beams make broad\\r\\n\\r\\nthe common light of day!\\r\\nThough Time may dim,\\r\\n\\r\\nthough Death has barred their portal,\\r\\nThese we salute,\\r\\nwhich nameless passed away.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F.

The basis of self-government and freedom requires the development of character and self-restraint and perseverance and the long view. And these are qualities which require many years of training and education. So that I think this University and others like it across the country, and its graduates, have recognized that these schools are not maintained by the people of the various States in order to merely give the graduates of these schools an economic advantage in the life struggle. Rather, these schools are supported by our people because our people realize that this country has needed in the past, and needs today as never before, educated men and women who are committed to the cause of freedom. So for what this University has done in the past, and what its graduates can do now and in the future, I salute you.\\r\\nThis University was rounded when the Civil War was already on, and no one could be sure in 1861 whether this country would survive. But the picture which the student of 1961 has of the world, and indeed the picture which our citizens have of the world, is infinitely more complicated and infinitely more dangerous.\\r\\nIn 1961 the world relations of this country have become tangled and complex. One of our former allies has become our adversary—and he has his own adversaries who are not our allies. Heroes are removed from their tombs—history rewritten—the names of cities changed overnight.\\r\\nWe increase our arms at a heavy cost, primarily to make certain that we will not have to use them. We must face up to the chance of war, if we are to maintain the peace. We must work with certain countries lacking in freedom in order to strengthen the cause of freedom. We find some who call themselves neutral who are our friends and sympathetic to us, and others who call themselves neutral who are unremittingly hostile to us. And as the most powerful defender of freedom on earth, we find ourselves unable to escape the responsibilities of freedom, and yet unable to exercise it without restraints imposed by the very freedoms we seek to protect.\\r\\nWe cannot, as a free nation, compete with our adversaries in tactics of terror, assassination, false promises, counterfeit mobs and crises.\\r\\nWe cannot, under the scrutiny of a free press and public, tell different stories to different audiences, foreign and domestic, friendly and hostile.\\r\\nWe cannot abandon the slow processes of consulting with our allies to match the swift expediencies of those who merely dictate to their satellites.\\r\\nWe can neither abandon nor control the international organization in which we now cast less than 1 percent of the vote in the General Assembly.\\r\\nWe possess weapons of tremendous power—but they are least effective in combating the weapons most often used by freedom's foes: subversion, infiltration, guerrilla warfare, civil disorder.\\r\\nWe send arms to other peoples—just as we send them the ideals of democracy in which we believe—but we cannot send them the will to use those arms or to abide by those ideals.\\r\\nAnd while we believe not only in the force of arms but in the force of right and reason, we have learned that reason does not always appeal to unreasonable men—that it is not always true that \\\"a soft answer turneth away wrath\\\"—and that right does not always make might.\\r\\nIn short, we must face problems which do not lend themselves to easy or quick or permanent solutions. And we must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscient—that we are only 6 percent of the world's population—that we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankind—that we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversity—and that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.\\r\\nThese burdens and frustrations are accepted by most Americans with maturity and understanding. They may long for the days when war meant charging up San Juan Hill—or when our isolation was guarded by two oceans—or when the atomic bomb was ours alone—or when much of the industrialized world depended upon our resources and our aid. But they now know that those days are gone—and that gone with them are the old policies and the old complacency's. And they know, too, that we must make the best of our new problems and our new opportunities, whatever the risk and the cost.\\r\\nBut there are others who cannot bear the burden of a long twilight struggle. They lack confidence in our long-run capacity to survive and succeed. Hating communism, yet they see communism in the long run, perhaps, as the wave of the future. And they want some quick and easy and final and cheap solution—now.\\r\\nThere are two groups of these frustrated citizens, far apart in their views yet very much alike in their approach. On the one hand are those who urge upon us what I regard to be the pathway of surrender—appeasing our enemies, compromising our commitments, purchasing peace at any price, disavowing our arms, our friends, our obligations. If their view had prevailed, the world of free choice would be smaller today.\\r\\nOn the other hand are those who urge upon us what I regard to be the pathway of war: equating negotiations with appeasement and substituting rigidity for firmness. If their view had prevailed, we would be at war today, and in more than one place.\\r\\nIt is a curious fact that each of these extreme opposites resembles the other. Each believes that we have only two choices: appeasement or war, suicide or surrender, humiliation or holocaust, to be either Red or dead. Each side sees only \\\"hard\\\" and \\\"soft\\\" nations, hard and soft policies, hard and soft men. Each believes that any departure from its own course inevitably leads to the other: one group believes that any peaceful solution means appeasement; the other believes that any arms build-up means war. One group regards everyone else as warmongers, the other regards everyone else as appeasers. Neither side admits that its path will lead to disaster—but neither can tell us how or where to draw the line once we descend the slippery slopes of appeasement or constant intervention.\\r\\nIn short, while both extremes profess to be the true realists of our time, neither could be more unrealistic. While both claim to be doing the nation a service, they could do it no greater disservice. This kind of talk and easy solutions to difficult problems, if believed, could inspire a lack of confidence among our people when they must all—above all else—be united in recognizing the long and difficult days that lie ahead. It could inspire uncertainty among our allies when above all else they must be confident in us. And even more dangerously, it could, if believed, inspire doubt among our adversaries when they must above all be convinced that we will defend our vital interests.\\r\\nThe essential fact that both of these groups fail to grasp is that diplomacy and defense are not substitutes for one another. Either alone would fail. A willingness to resist force, unaccompanied by a willingness to talk, could provoke belligerence—while a willingness to talk, unaccompanied by a willingness to resist force, could invite disaster.\\r\\nBut as long as we know what comprises our vital interests and our long-range goals, we have nothing to fear from negotiations at the appropriate time, and nothing to gain by refusing to take part in them. At a time when a single clash could escalate overnight into a holocaust of mushroom clouds, a great power does not prove its firmness by leaving the task of exploring the other's intentions to sentries or those without full responsibility. Nor can ultimate weapons rightfully be employed, or the ultimate sacrifice rightfully demanded of our citizens, until every reasonable solution has been explored. \\\"How many wars,\\\" Winston Churchill has written, \\\"have been averted by patience and persisting good will! .... How many wars have been precipitated by firebrands!\\\"\\r\\nIf vital interests under duress can be preserved by peaceful means, negotiations will find that out. If our adversary will accept nothing-less than a concession of our rights, negotiations will find that out. And if negotiations are to take place, this nation cannot abdicate to its adversaries the task of choosing the forum and the framework and the time.\\r\\nFor there are carefully defined limits within which any serious negotiations must take place. With respect to any future talks on Germany and Berlin, for example, we cannot, on the one hand, confine our proposals to a list of concessions we are willing to make, nor can we, on the other hand, advance any proposals which compromise the security of free Germans and West Berliners, or endanger their ties with the West.\\r\\nNo one should be under the illusion that negotiations for the sake of negotiations always advance the cause of peace. If for lack of preparation they break up in bitterness, the prospects of peace have been endangered. If they are made a forum for propaganda or a cover for aggression, the processes of peace have been abused.\\r\\nBut it is a test of our national maturity to accept the fact that negotiations are not a contest spelling victory or defeat. They may succeed—they may fail. They are likely to be successful only if both sides reach an agreement which both regard as preferable to the status quo—an agreement in which each side can consider its own situation to be improved. And this is most difficult to obtain.\\r\\nBut, while we shall negotiate freely, we shall not negotiate freedom. Our answer to the classic question of Patrick Henry is still no—life is not so dear, and peace is not so precious, \\\"as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery.\\\" And that is our answer even though, for the first time since the ancient battles between Greek city-states, war entails the threat of total annihilation, of everything we know, of society itself. For to save mankind's future freedom, we must face up to any risk that is necessary. We will always seek peace—but we will never surrender.\\r\\nIn short, we are neither \\\"warmongers\\\" nor \\\"appeasers,\\\" neither \\\"hard\\\" nor \\\"soft.\\\" We are Americans, determined to defend the frontiers of freedom, by an honorable peace if peace is possible, but by arms if arms are used against us.\\r\\nAnd if we are to move forward in that spirit, we shall need all the calm and thoughtful citizens that this great University can produce, all the light they can shed, all the wisdom they can bring to bear. It is customary, both here and around the world, to regard life in the United States as easy. Our advantages are many. But more than any other people on earth, we bear burdens and accept risks unprecedented in their size and their duration, not for ourselves alone but for all who wish to be free. No other generation of free men in any country has ever faced so many and such difficult challenges—not even those who lived in the days when this University was founded in 1861.\\r\\nThis nation was then torn by war. This territory had only the simplest elements of civilization. And this city had barely begun to function. But a university was one of their earliest thoughts—and they summed it up in the motto that they adopted: \\\"Let there be light.\\\" What more can be said today, regarding all the dark and tangled problems we face than: Let there be light. And to accomplish that illumination, the University of Washington shall still hold high the torch.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F.

But whether the degree be honorary or earned, it is a proud symbol of this university and this State.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth Carolina has long been identified with enlightened and progressive leaders and people, and I can think of no more important reason for that reputation than this university, which year after year has sent educated men and women who have had a recognition of their public responsibility as well as in their private interests.\\r\\n\\r\\nDistinguished Presidents like President Graham and Gray, distinguished leaders like the Secretary of Commerce, Governor Hodges, distinguished members of the congressional delegation, carry out a tradition which stretches back to the beginning of this school, and that is that the graduate of this university is a man of his Nation as well as a man of his time. And it is my hope, in a changing world, when untold possibilities lie before North Carolina, and indeed the entire South and country, that this university will still hew to the old line of the responsibility that its graduates owe to the community at large--that in your time, too, you will be willing to give to the State and country a portion of your lives and all of your knowledge and all of your loyalty.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to emphasize, in the great concentration which we now place upon scientists and engineers, how much we still need the men and women educated in the liberal traditions, willing to take the long look, undisturbed by prejudices and slogans of the moment, who attempt to make an honest judgment on difficult events.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis university has a more important function today than ever before, and therefore I am proud as President of the United States, and as a graduate of a small land grant college in Massachusetts, Harvard University, to come to this center of education.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose of you who regard my profession of political life with some disdain should remember that it made it possible for me to move from being an obscure lieutenant in the United States Navy to Commander-in-Chief in 14 years, with very little technical competence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut more than that, I hope that you will realize that from the beginning of this country, and especially in North Carolina, there has been the closest link between educated men and women and politics and government. And also to remember that our nation's first great leaders were also our first great scholars.\\r\\n\\r\\nA contemporary described Thomas Jefferson as \\\"a gentleman of 32 who could calculate an eclipse, survey an estate, tie an artery, plan an edifice, try a cause, break a horse, dance the minuet, and play the violin.\\\" John Quincy Adams, after being summarily dismissed by the Massachusetts Legislature from the United States Senate for supporting Thomas Jefferson, could then become Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard University, and then become a great Secretary of State.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Senator Daniel Webster could stroll down the corridors of the Congress a few steps, after making some of the greatest speeches in the history of this country, and dominate the Supreme Court as the foremost lawyer of his day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis versatility, this vitality, this intellectual energy, put to the service of our country, represents our great resource in these difficult days.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would urge you, therefore, regardless of your specialty, and regardless of your chosen field or occupation, and regardless of whether you bear office or not, that you recognize the contribution which you can make as educated men and women to intellectual and political leadership in these difficult days, when the problems are infinitely more complicated and come with increasing speed, with increasing significance, in our lives than they were a century ago when so many gifted men dominated our political life. The United States Senate had more able men serving in it, from the period of 1830 to 1850, than probably any time in our history, and yet they dealt with three or four problems which they had dealt with for over a generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow they come day by day, from all parts of the world. Even the experts find themselves confused, and therefore in a free society such as this, where the people must make an educated judgment, they depend upon those of you who have had the advantage of the scholar's education.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ask you to give to the service of our country the critical faculties which society has helped develop in you here. I ask you to decide, as Goethe put it, \\\"whether you will be an anvil or a hammer,\\\" whether you will give the United States, in which you were reared and educated, the broadest possible benefits of that education.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's not enough to lend your talents to deploring present solutions. Most educated men and women on occasions prefer to discuss what is wrong, rather than to suggest alternative courses of action. But, \\\"would you have counted him a friend of ancient Greece,\\\" as George William Curtis asked a body of educators a century ago, \\\"would you have counted him a friend of ancient Greece who quietly discussed the theory of patriotism on that hot summer day through whose hopeless and immortal hours Leonidas and the three hundred stood at Thermopylae for liberty? Was John Milton to conjugate Greek verbs in his library when the liberty of Englishmen was imperiled?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a great institution with a great tradition and with devoted alumni, and with the support of the people of this State. Its establishment and continued functioning, like that of all great universities, has required great sacrifice by the people of North Carolina. I cannot believe that all of this is undertaken merely to give this school's graduates an economic advantage in the lifestruggle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"A university,\\\" said Professor Woodrow Wilson, \\\"should be an organ of memory for the State, for the transmission of its best traditions.\\\" And Prince Bismarck was even more specific. \\\"One third of the students of German universities,\\\" he once said, \\\"'broke down from over-work, another third broke down from dissipation, and the other third ruled Germany.\\\" I leave it to each of you to decide in which category you will fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not suggest that our political and public life should be turned over to college trained experts, nor would I give this university a seat in the Congress, as William and Mary was once represented in the Virginia House of Burgesses, nor would I adopt from the Belgian constitution a provision giving three votes instead of one to college graduates--at least not until more Democrats go to college. But I do hope that you join us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis university produces trained men and women, and what this country needs are those who look, as the motto of your State says, at things as they are and not at things as they seem to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this meeting is held at an extraordinary time. Angola and Algeria, Brazil and Bizerte, Syria and South Viet-Nam, Korea or Kuwait, the Dominican Republic, Berlin, the United Nations itself--all problems which 20 years ago we could not even dream of.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur task in this country is to do our best, to serve our Nation's interest as we see 'it, and not to be swayed from our course by the faint-hearted or the unknowing, or the threats of those who would make themselves our foes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not a simple task in a democracy. We cannot open all our books in advance to an adversary who operates in the night, the decisions we make, the weapons we possess, the bargains we will accept--nor can we always see reflected overnight the success or failure of the actions that we may take.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn times past, a simple slogan described our policy: \\\"Fifty-four-forty or fight.\\\" \\\"To make the world safe for democracy.\\\" \\\"No entangling alliances.\\\" But the times, issues, and the weapons, all have changed--and complicate and endanger our lives. It is a dangerous illusion to believe that the policies of the United States, stretching as they do world-wide, under varying and different conditions, can be encompassed in one slogan or one adjective, hard or soft or otherwise-or to believe that we shall soon meet total victory or total defeat.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeace and freedom do not come cheap, and we are destined, all of us here today, to live out most if not all of our lives in uncertainty and challenge and peril. Our policy must therefore blend whatever degree of firmness and flexibility which is necessary to protect our vital interests, by peaceful means if possible, by resolute action if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, of course, no place in America where reason and firmness are more clearly pointed out than here in North Carolina. All Americans can profit from what happened in this State a century ago. It was this State, firmly fixed in the traditions of the South, which sought a way of reason in a troubled and dangerous world. Yet when the War came, North Carolina provided a fourth of all of the Confederate soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice in those years. And it won the right to the slogan, \\\"First at Bethel. Farthest to the front at Gettysburg and Chickamauga. Last at Appomattox.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIts quest for a peaceful resolution of our problems was never identified in the minds of its people, of people today, with anything but a desire for peace and a preparation to meet their responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe move for the first time in our history through an age in which two opposing powers have the capacity to destroy each other, and while we do not intend to see the free world give up, we shall make every effort to prevent the world from being blown up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Eagle on our official seal emphasizes both peace and freedom, and as I said in the State of the Union Address, we in this country give equal attention to its claws when it in its left hand holds the arrows and in its right the olive branch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a time of national maturity, understanding, and willingness to face issues as they are, not as we would like them to be. It is a test of our ability to be far-seeing and calm, as well as resolute, to keep an eye on both our dangers and our opportunities, and not to be diverted by momentary gains, or setbacks, or pressures. And it is the long view of the educated citizen to which the graduates of this university can best contribute.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must distinguish the real from the illusory, the long-range from the temporary, the significant from the petty, but if we can be purposeful, if we can face up to our risks and live up to our word, if we can do our duty undeterred by fanatics or frenzy at home or abroad, then surely peace and freedom can prevail. We shall be neither Red nor dead, but alive and free--and worthy of the traditions and responsibilities of North Carolina and the United States of America.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"October 12, 1961: Address at the University of North Carolina\"},{\"doc_name\":\"october-13-1960-debate-richard-nixon-new-york-and-los-angeles\",\"date\":\"1960-10-13\",\"transcript\":\"BILL SHADEL, MODERATOR: Good evening. I'm Bill Shadel of ABC News. It's my privilege this evening to preside at this the third in the series of meetings on radio and television of the two major presidential candidates. Now like the last meeting the subjects to be discussed will be suggested by questions from a panel of correspondents. Unlike the first two programs, however, the two candidates will not be sharing the same platform. In New York the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator John F. Kennedy; separated by three thousand miles in a Los Angeles studio, the Republican presidential nominee, Vice President Richard M. Nixon; now joined for tonight's discussion by a network of electronic facilities which permits each candidate to see and hear the other. Good evening, Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Good evening, Mr. Shadel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: And good evening to you, Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Good evening, Mr. Shadel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: And now to meet the panel of correspondents. Frank McGee, NBC News; Charles Van Fremd, CBS News; Douglass Cater, Reporter magazine; Roscoe Drummond, New York Herald Tribune. Now, as you've probably noted, the four reporters include a newspaper man and a magazine reporter; these two selected by lot by the press secretaries of the candidates from among the reporters traveling with the candidates. The broadcasting representatives were chosen by their companies. The rules for this evening have been agreed upon by the representatives of both candidates and the radio and television networks and I should like to read them. There will be no opening statements by the candidates nor any closing summation. The entire hour will be devoted to answering questions from the reporters. Each candidate to be questioned in turn with opportunity for comment by the other. Each answer will be limited to two and one-half minutes, each comment to one and a half minutes. The reporters are free to ask any question they choose on any subject. Neither candidate knows what questions will be asked. Time alone will dete- determine who will be asked the final question. Now the first question is from Mr. McGee and is for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Senator Kennedy, yesterday you used the words \\\"trigger-happy\\\" in referring to Vice President Richard Nixon's stand on defending the islands of Quemoy and Matsu. Last week on a program like this one, you said the next president would come face to face with a serious crisis in Berlin. So the question is: would you take military action to defend Berlin?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Mr. McGee, we have a contractual right to be in Berlin coming out of the conversations at Potsdam and of World War II. That has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the United States; it's been reinforced by a number of other nations under NATO. I've stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin. It is a commitment that we have to meet if we're going to protect the security of Western Europe. And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians. We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Mr. Vice President, do you wish to comment?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Yes. As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that - to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans. I resent that comment. I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war. I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years. I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war. There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war. I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party. But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record. We had a war when we came into power in 1953. We got rid of that; we've kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesn't indicate that we're trigger-happy. We've been strong, but we haven't been trigger-happy. As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: The next question is by Mr. Von Fremd for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. VON FREMD: Mr. Vice President, a two-part question concerning the offshore islands in the Formosa Straits. If you were president and the Chinese Communists tomorrow began an invasion of Quemoy and Matsu, would you launch the uh - United States into a war by sending the Seventh Fleet and other military forces to resist this aggression; and secondly, if the uh - regular conventional forces failed to halt such uh - such an invasion, would you authorize the use of nuclear weapons?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Mr. Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack. I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa. But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States. I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested - to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance - is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war. This is the history of dealing with dictators. This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know. We tried this with Hitler. It didn't work. He wanted first uh - we know, Austria, and then he went on to the Sudetenland and then Danzig, and each time it was thought this is all that he wanted. Now what do the Chinese Communists want? They don't want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don't want just Formosa; they want the world. And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you're not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that's going to satisfy them, it doesn't satisfy them. It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them? I've often heard President Eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them? And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Senator Kennedy, do you wish to comment?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Yes. The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island. The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China. Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - \\\"neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu.\\\" Now, that is the issue. I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa. I support it and the Pescadores Island. That is the present American position. The treaty does not include these two islands. Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked. I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty. Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there's a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa. Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American. The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area. They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five. We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them. This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Mr. Cater has the next question for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CATER: Senator Kennedy, last week you said that before we should hold another summit conference, that it was important that the United States build its strength. Modern weapons take quite a long time to build. What sort of prolonged period do you envisage before there can be a summit conference? And do you think that there can be any new initiatives on the grounds of nuclear disarmament uh - nuclear control or weapons control d- uh - during this period?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces. Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris. It may be a long period, but we must - we must get started immediately. Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity. There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity - including Red China - by the end of the presidential office in 1964. This is extremely serious. There have been many wars in the history of mankind. And to take a chance uh - now be - and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake. One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don't feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament. Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it's been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva. Now, we may not succeed. The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system. We may be able to get satisfactory assurances. It may be necessary for us to begin testing again. But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels. These must be done. If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves. But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Mr. Vice President, your comment?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Yes. I am going to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before the next debate, and I will have an opportunity then to answer any other questions that may arise with regard to my position on it. There isn't any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let's have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven't been making an effort, he simply doesn't know what he's talking about. It isn't a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration. It's a question of who they are. This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself. We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way. And I just want to make one thing very clear. Yes, we should make a great effort. But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust. There must be an absolute guarantee. Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy's last answer. He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for - which he did - that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment - and on this particular - or for an amendment, I should say - which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve. And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans - put them on record - against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: The next question is by Mr. Drummond for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. DRUMMOND: Mr. Nixon, I would like to ask eh - one more aspect or raise another aspect of this same question. Uh - it is my understanding that President Eisenhower never advocated that Quemoy and Matsu should be defended under all circumstances as a matter of principle. I heard Secretary Dulles at a press conference in fifty-eight say that he thought that it was a mistake for Chiang Kai-shek to deploy troops to these islands. I would like to ask what has led you to take what appears to be a different position on this subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles' press conference, I think if you read it all - and I know that you have - you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended. There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don't think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles' statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa. Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question. As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun. Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again. So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa. What do we do then? My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return. And that means war. We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II. We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again. That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955. And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve. The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history. And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this - change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors - the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors - to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable. The road to war is always paved with good intentions. And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace. But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: I don't think it's possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did. In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: \\\"The treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area.\\\" That was done with much thought and deliberation. Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area. I completely sustained the treaty. I voted for it. I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island. What we're now talking about is the Vice President's determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area. I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek - and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments. Uh - He sent a mission - the President - in 1955 of Mr. uh - Robertson and Admiral Radford. General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959. General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: \\\"To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take. To me that concept is completely repugnant.\\\" So I stand with them. I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible. I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war. I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun. But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty. Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he's never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Mr. Von Fremd has a question for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. VON FREMD: Senator Kennedy, I'd like to uh - shift the conversation, if I may, to a domestic uh - political argument. The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Senator Thruston Morton, declared earlier this week that you owed Vice President Nixon and the Republican party a public apology for some strong charges made by former President Harry Truman, who bluntly suggested where the Vice President and the Republican party could go. Do you feel that you owe the Vice President an apology?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; he's been in politics for fifty years; he's been president of the United States. They may - are not my style. But I really don't think there's anything that I could say to President Truman that's going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner. Perhaps Mrs. Truman can, but I don't think I can. I'll just have to tell Mr. Morton that. If you'd pass that message on to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Any comment, Mr. Vice President?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Yes, I think so. Of course, both er - Senator Kennedy and I have felt Mr. Truman's ire; and uh - consequently, I think he can speak with some feeling on this subject. I just do want to say one thing, however. We all have tempers; I have one; I'm sure Senator Kennedy has one. But when a man's president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public. One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates. I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States. I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too. It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to. And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States. And I only hope that, should I win this election, that I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the White House and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say: \\\"Well, there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that I would want my child to follow.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Mr. Cater's question is for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CATER: Mr. Vice President, I'd like to return just once more, if I may, to this area of dealing with the Communists. Critics have claimed that on at least three occasions in recent years - on the sending of American troops to Indochina in 1954, on the matter of continuing the U-2 flights uh - in May, and then on this definition of the - of our commitment to the offshore island - that you have overstated the Administration position, that you have taken a more bellicose position than President Eisenhower. Just two days ago you said that you called on uh - Senator Kennedy to serve notice to Communist aggressors around the world that we're not going to retreat one inch more any place, where as we did retreat from the Tachen Islands, or at least Chiang Kai-shek did. Would you say this was a valid criticism of your statement of foreign policy?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Well, Mr. Cater, of course it's a criticism that uh - is being made. Uh - I obviously don't think it's valid. I have supported the Administration's position and I think that that position has been correct; I think my position has been correct. As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination. Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there. Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout. I think the President was correct in ordering these flights. I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on. I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here. And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time. The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag. Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu. What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands. Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position. Now, why did they reject it? For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free. Why? Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Senator Kennedy?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, \\\"American boys into Indochina.\\\" The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina. Number two, on the question of the U-2 flights. I thought the. U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success. I never criticized the U-2 flights in general, however. I never suggested espionage should stop. It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides. Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth. Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu. That's not the position he's taking. He's indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom. He didn't take that position on Tibet. He didn't take that position on Budapest. He doesn't take that position that I've seen so far in Laos. Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba. I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores. But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he's been supported by most military authority, these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment. And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself. He's extending the Administration's commitment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Mr. Drummond's question is for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. DRUMMOND: Uh - Mr. Kennedy, Representative Adam Clayton Powell, in the course of his speaking tour in your behalf, is saying, and I quote: \\\"The Ku Klux Klan is riding again in this campaign. If it doesn't stop, all bigots will vote for Nixon and all right-thinking Christians and Jews will vote for Kennedy rather than be found in the ranks of the Klan-minded.\\\" End quotation. Governor Michael DiSalle is saying much the same thing. What I would like to ask, Senator Kennedy, is what is the purpose of this sort of thing and how do you feel about it?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon. I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan. That's absurd. I don't suggest that, I don't support it. I would disagree with it. Mr. Nixon knows very well that in this - in this whole matter that's been involved with the so-called religious discussion in this campaign, I've never suggested, even by the vaguest implication, that he did anything but disapprove it. And that's my view now. I disapprove of the issue. I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Mr. Vice President.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Well I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this largest television audience in history something that I have been saying in the past and want to - will always say in the future. On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce. We can't settle for anything but the best. And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce. And that means that we can't have any test of religion. We can't have any test of race. It must be a test of a man. Also as far as religion is concerned. I have seen Communism abroad. I see what it does. Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together. We must not be divided on this issue. The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues. I obviously repudiate the Klan; I repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue; I will not tolerate it, I have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it and I say - say to this great audience, whoever may be listening, remember, if you believe in America, if you want America to set the right example to the world, that we cannot have religious or racial prejudice. We cannot have it in our hearts. But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Mr. McGee has a question for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Vice President, some of your early campaign literature said you were making a study to see if new laws were needed to protect the public against excessive use of power by labor unions. Have you decided whether such new laws are needed, and, if so, what would they do?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week. Uh - Also, so that we can get the uh - opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate. Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes. Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point. He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike. I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining. I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure. I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want. I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes. One last point I should make. The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration. We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal. And I only want to say that however good the record is, it's got to be better. Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management. We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Senator, your comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, I always have difficulty recognizing my positions when they're stated by the Vice President. I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes. I'm opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958. I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act. I don't know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about. I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations - recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them. One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure. There might be others. By the president having five powers - four or five powers - and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government. The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited. He can set up a fact-finding committee. The fact-finding committee's powers are limited. He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress. This is a difficult and sensitive matter. But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do. He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now - the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn't happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: The next question is by Mr. Cater for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CATER: Uh - Mr. Kennedy, uh - Senator - uh - Vice President Nixon says that he has costed the two party platforms and that yours would run at least ten billion dollars a year more than his. You have denied his figures. He has called on you to supply your figures. Would you do that?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress. The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession - and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars - or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh - during part of the Korean War. On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it's my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program. My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson's program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history. We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that. Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers. I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars. Third, I think it's possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts. Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire. It is actuarially sound. So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has. But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention. Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh - is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Mr. Vice President?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Senator Kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that I have been misstating his record and his figures. I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct. Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of \\\"here-it-is-and-here-it-isn't.\\\" Uh - On the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isn't a problem because it's from Social Security. But Social Security is a tax. The people pay it. It comes right out of your paycheck. This doesn't mean that the people aren't going to be paying the bill. He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours. Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the - America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time. And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay. Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers? I don't think we should have that kind of a program. Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way. Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation. We're going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board. I don't believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Next, Mr. Drummond's question for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. DRUMMOND: Uh - Mr. Nixon uh - before the convention you and Governor Rockefeller said jointly that the nation's economic growth ought to be accelerated; and the Republican platform states that uh - the nation needs to quicken the pace of economic growth. Uh - Is it fair, therefore, Mr. Vice President, to conclude that you feel that there has been insufficient economic growth during the past eight years; and if so, what would you do beyond uh - present Administration policies uh - to step it up?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country. I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly. Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough. Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want. We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America. It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle. Now, what do we do about it? And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion. So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy. In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth. I refer, for example, to distressed areas. We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas. We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately. That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need. And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth. Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still. Let's get that straight. Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America. He's been traveling in some other country. We have been moving. We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years. But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent. That's untrue. The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread. Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents. The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can. And I believe when the average hour for many farmers' wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better. But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error. The Vice President suggested a number of things. He suggested that we aid distressed areas. The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice. He suggested we pass an aid to education bill. But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education. And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added. This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959. And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more. Governor Rockefeller says five per cent. The Democratic platform and others say five per cent. Many say four and a half per cent. The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent. That's why we don't have full employment today.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Mr. McGee has the next question for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Uh - Senator Kennedy, a moment ago you mentioned tax loopholes. Now your running mate, Senator Lyndon Johnson, is from Texas, an oil-producing state and one that many political leaders feel is in doubt in this election year. And reports from there say that oil men in Texas are seeking assurance from Senator Johnson that the oil depletion allowance will not be cut. The Democratic platform pledges to plug holes in the tax laws and refers to inequitable depletion allowance as being conspicuous loopholes. My question is, do you consider the twenty-seven and a half per cent depletion allowance inequitable, and would you ask that it be cut?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Uh - Mr. McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance - different kind of minerals, including oil. I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay. That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation. We want to be sure it's fair and equitable. It includes oil abroad. Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home. Now the oil industry recently has had hard times. Particularly some of the smaller producers. They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas. But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully. And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent. I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Mr. Vice President.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Senator Kennedy's position and mine completely different on this. I favor the present depletion allowance. I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich. Why do we have a depletion allowance? Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it. If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country. Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's. And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them. And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing. One other thing. He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account. He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion. I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated. But I oppose it. I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned. I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Gentlemen, if I may remind you, time is growing short, so please keep your questions and answers as brief as possible consistent with clarity. Mr. Von Fremd for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. VON FREMD: Mr. Vice President, in the past three years, there has been an exodus of more than four billion dollars of gold from the United States, apparently for two reasons: because exports have slumped and haven't covered imports, and because of increased American investments abroad. If you were president, how would you go about stopping this departure of gold from our shores?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Well, Mr. Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar. That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out. Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports. And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce. This one must be stepped up. Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom. Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect. I think we have been right in carrying it. I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance. But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely. They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad. That's why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration - if, of course, I get the opportunity - a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America. The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself. We can a big share of it, but we've got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Just to uh - correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine. What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there aren't loopholes. If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it. Now on the question of gold. The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies. In other words, if we're going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy. We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade. We have to be able to compete in the world market. We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if we're going to be able to meet our obligations. In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage. Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods. I believe that we must be able to compete in the market - steel and in all the basic commodities abroad - we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead. We have to be sure to maintain that. We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Mr. Drummond's question now for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. DRUMMOND: Senator Kennedy, a question on American prestige. In light of the fact that the Soviet Ambassador was recently expelled from the Congo, and that Mr. Khrushchev has this week canceled his trip to Cuba for fear of stirring resentment throughout all Latin America, I would like to ask you to spell out somewhat more fully how you think we should measure American prestige, to determine whether it is rising or whether it is falling.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige. And the significance of prestige, really, is because we're so identified with the cause of freedom. Therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh - who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism, they'll be persuaded to follow our example. There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was. Mr. George Allen, the head of our information service, said that a result of our being second in space, in the sputnik in 1957, and I quote him, I believe I paraphrase him accurately. He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement. And therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the United States. Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours. Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours. This has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources. Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily. And a majority in every country except Greece, felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970. Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa. Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us. A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us. On the neutralists' resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened. The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil, took a trip to Cuba to call on Mr. Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh - within Brazil. There are many indications. Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself. Laos is moving in that direction. So I would say our prestige is not so high. No longer do we give the image of being on the rise. No longer do we give an image of vitality.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Mr. Vice President.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Well, I would say first of all that Senator's - Kennedy's statement that he's just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isn't going to help our prestige either. Let's look at the other side of the coin. Let's look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union. Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is. We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy. Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us. We're well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and don't run her down in order to build her up. We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what's right. And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu. I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy's advan- advice to go - go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did - said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists. In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically. Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat. Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SHADEL: Thank you gentlemen. As we mentioned at the opening of this program, the candidates agreed that the clock alone would determine who had the last word. The two candidates wish to thank the networks for the opportunity to appear for this discussion. I would repeat the ground rules likewise agreed upon by representatives of the two candidates and the radio and television networks. The entire hour was devoted to answering questions from the reporters. Each candidate was questioned in turn and each had the opportunity to comment on the answer of his opponent. The reporters were free to ask any question on any subject. Neither candidate was given any advance information on any question that would be asked. Those were the conditions agreed upon for this third meeting of the candidates tonight. Now I might add that also agreed upon was the fact that when the hour got down to the last few minutes, if there was not sufficient time left for another question and suitable time for answers and comment, the questioning would end at that point. That is the situation at this moment. And after reviewing the rules for this evening I might use the remaining moments of the hour to tell you something about the other arrangements for this debate with the participants a continent apart. I would emphasize first that each candidate was in a studio alone except for three photographers and three reporters of the press and the television technicians. Those studios identical in every detail of lighting, background, physical equipment, even to the paint used in decorating. We newsmen in a third studio have also experienced a somewhat similar isolation. Now, I would remind you the fourth in the series of these historic joint appearances, scheduled for Friday, October twenty-first. At that time the candidates will again share the same platform to discuss foreign policy. This is Bill Shadel. Goodnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"October 13, 1960: Debate with Richard Nixon in New York and Los Angeles\"},{\"doc_name\":\"october-21-1960-debate-richard-nixon-new-york\",\"date\":\"1960-10-21\",\"transcript\":\"QUINCY HOWE, MODERATOR: I am Quincy Howe of ABC News saying good evening from New York where the two major candidates for president of the United States are about to engage in their fourth radio-television discussion of the present campaign. Tonight these men will confine that discussion to foreign policy. Good evening, Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Good evening, Mr. Howe.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: And good evening, Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Good evening, Mr. Howe.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: Now let me read the rules and conditions under which the candidates themselves have agreed to proceed. As they did in their first meeting, both men will make opening statements of about eight minutes each and closing statements of equal time running three to five minutes each. During the half hour between the opening and closing statements, the candidates will answer and comment upon questions from a panel of four correspondents chosen by the nationwide networks that carry the program. Each candidate will be questioned in turn with opportunity for comment by the other. Each answer will be limited to two and one-half minutes, each comment to one and one-half minutes. The correspondents are free to ask any questions they choose in the field of foreign affairs. Neither candidate knows what questions will be asked. Time alone will determine the final question. Reversing the order in their first meeting, Senator Kennedy will make the second opening statement and the first closing statement. For the first opening statement, here is Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans. Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege. I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about. There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live. And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace - keep it without surrender? How can we extend freedom - extend it without war? Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace? Who threatens freedom in the world? There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement. And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders. I know Mr. Khrushchev. I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world. I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom. First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past. In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain. And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives. In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower's Administration, this situation has been reversed. We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table. Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful? I think there're several reasons. In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world. One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War. In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area. They thought they were going to have peace - it brought war. We learned from their mistakes. And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return. We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area. But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world. That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done. That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations - recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard - recommendations with regard to - again - slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if - in effect, to the Communists. Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong? Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you. It encourages them to begin a war. And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender. Let us move now to the future. It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen. That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area. First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability. They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything. We need this kind of strength because we're the guardians of the peace. In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow. It has grown in the past seven years. It can and will grow even more in the next four. And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we're in a race for survival - a race in which it isn't enough to be ahead; it isn't enough simply to be complacent. We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead. And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead - move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field. And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies. What are they? Again we turn to the past. Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult. When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues. And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow. But all this by itself is not enough. It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy. We must have a great goal. And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny. To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism. And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line. And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender. We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom - victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries - provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: Now the opening statement of Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President. First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu. I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955. I have sustained it since then. I've said that I agree with the Administration policy. Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores. I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy. I've supported that policy. In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly. So that really isn't an issue in this campaign. It isn't an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy. Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign. The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security? Is our relative strength growing? Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low? I don't believe it is. I don't believe that our relative strength is increasing. And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States. I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States. In 1957 I was in Havana. I talked to the American Ambassador there. He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba. And yet even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner, both Republican Ambassadors, both warned of Castro, the Marxist influences around Castro, the Communist influences around Castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the American government, nothing was done. Our d- security depends upon Latin America. Can any American looking at the situation in Latin America feel contented with what's happening today, when a candidate for the presidency of Brazil feels it necessary to call - not on Washington during the campaign - but on Castro in Havana, in order to pick up the support of the Castro supporters in Brazil? At the American Conference - Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldn't even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro. It was rather a vague statement that they finally made. Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do? Do you know we don't have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again? Africa is now the emerging area of the world. It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly. We didn't even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957. In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand. If there's one thing Africa needs it's technical assistance. And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world. We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down. We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate. There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine. We look to Europe uh - to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world. Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years? That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago. But are we doing enough in these areas? What are freedom's chances in those areas? By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America? Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa - will there be others? Will the Congo go Communist? Will other countries? Are we doing enough in that area? And what about Asia? Is India going to win the economic struggle or is China going to win it? Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years? Communism? The Chinese? Or will freedom? The question which we have to decide as Americans - are we doing enough today? Is our strength and prestige rising? Do people want to be identified with us? Do they want to follow United States leadership? I don't think they do, enough. And that's what concerns me. In Africa - these countries that have newly joined the United Nations. On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us - Liberia and the Union of South Africa. The rest either abstained or voted against us. More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us. I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade. I have seen Cuba go to the Communists. I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America. I have seen us ignore Africa. There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations. There isn't a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six. When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day. We didn't recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn't show up for nearly eight months. I believe that the world is changing fast. And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better. The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year. The Communists say, \\\"Come with us; look what we've done.\\\" And we've been in - on the whole, uninterested. I think we're going to have to do better. Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world. I think we are today. But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them. They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles. I'm not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963. He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom. I agree with him. What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world. And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we've had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain. We've had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world. I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon. The fact is that the State Department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the State Department has been unwilling to release them. And yet they were polled by the U.S.I.A. The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we're engaged. We want peace. We want freedom. We want security. We want to be stronger. We want freedom to gain. But I don't believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing - has identified itself with that change. I think the Communists have been moving with vigor - Laos, Africa, Cuba - all around the world today they're on the move. I think we have to revita1ize our society. I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first. And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: That completes the opening statements. Now the candidates will answer and comment upon questions put by these four correspondents: Frank Singiser of Mutual News, John Edwards of ABC News, Walter Cronkite of CBS News, John Chancellor of NBC News. Frank Singiser has the first question for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SINGISER: Mr. Vice President, I'd like to pin down the difference between the way you would handle Castro's regime and prevent the establishment of Communist governments in the Western Hemisphere and the way that t Senator Kennedy would proceed. Uh - Vice President Nixon, in what important respects do you feel there are differences between you, and why do you believe your policy is better for the peace and security of the United States in the Western Hemisphere?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Our policies are very different. I think that Senator Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he's made during the course of this campaign. In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime - provided they are anti-Batista. Now let's just see what this means. We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise. The charter of the United Nations - its Preamble, Article I and Article II - also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another. Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without. But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective. I know something else. It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that. This is the major recommendation that he's made. Now, what can we do? Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala. There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration. We quarantined Mr. Arbenz. The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out. We are quarantining Mr. Castro today. We're quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy's suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong. We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive. By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro. But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed. He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains. There isn't any doubt about that, number one. Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral. They have to include the other countries of Latin America. The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe. If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade - as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940 - the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro. That's the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime - and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others. Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America. The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia. We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America. His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine. His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America. You yourself said, Mr. Vice President, a month ago, that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had Castro. Why didn't we?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: John Edwards has his first question for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. EDWARDS: Senator Kennedy, one test of a new president's leadership will be the caliber of his appointments. It's a matter of interest here and overseas as to who will be the new secretary of state. Now, under our rules, I must ask this question of you, but I would hope that the Vice President also would answer it. Will you give us the names of three or four Americans, each of whom, if appointed, would serve with distinction in your judgment as secretary of state?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed. This is a decision that the president of the United States must make. The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948. This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States. There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state. I've made no judgment about who should be secretary of state. I think that judgment could be made after election, if I'm successful. The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power. The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs. Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state. I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs. I'm asking the people's support as president. We will select the best man we can get. But I've not made a judgment, and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people, among whom would be the candidate.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: Mr. Vice President, do you have a comment?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so. So that is my answer to this question. If you don't mind, I'd like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question. Eh- He was talking about the Castro regime and what we had been eh- doing in Latin America. I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars. We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America. Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations. Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: Walter Cronkite, you have your first question for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CRONKITE: Thank you Quincy. Mr. Vice President, Senator Fulbright and now tonight, Senator Kennedy, maintain that the Administration is suppressing a report by the United States Information Agency that shows a decline in United States prestige overseas. Are you aware of such a report, and if you are aware of the existence of such a report, should not that report, because of the great importance this issue has been given in this campaign, be released to the public?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright. Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated. First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh - period immediately after Sputnik. Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public. Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about \\\"what about American prestige abroad\\\": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be. Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige? Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it. Well let me make one thing clear. Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism. Every one of these items that I have mentioned he's been wrong - dead wrong. And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige. Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations. Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China. Let's look at the vote on Hungary. There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year. Let's look at the reaction eh - reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session. Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted? Not at all. The President gained. America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: Comment, Senator Kennedy?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen. I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service. I've just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion. What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country. Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made. The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space. We have - may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest - you yourself said to Khrushchev, \\\"You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we're ahead of you in color television\\\" in your famous discussion in the kitchen. I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust. Secondly, I didn't say we had the worst slums in the world. I said we had too many slums. And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed. I didn't say we had the worst education in the world. What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world. And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago. Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy. Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space. Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science. We're first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we're not first.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: John Chancellor, your first question for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CHANCELLOR: Senator, another question uh - in connection with our relations with the Russians. There have been stories from Washington from the Atomic Energy Commission hinting that the Russians may have resumed the testing of nuclear devices. Now if - sir, if this is true, should the United States resume nuclear testing, and if the Russians do not start testing, can you foresee any circumstances in 1961 in which the United States might resume its own series of tests?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Yes, I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests, number one. I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again. If we fail then, if we're unable to come to an agreement - and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers. Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there's some indications that by the time the next president's term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war. So one more effort should be made. I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere. They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space. But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States. If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race. I hope we can succeed. But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground. I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it. There may be testing in outer space. I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere. It's possible to detect those kind of tests. The kind of tests which you can't detect are underground or in - in uh - perhaps in outer space. So that I'm hopeful we can try once more. If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves. But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons. China may have it by 1963, Egypt. War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we're going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years. We ought to make one last effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: Any comment, Mr. Vice President?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Yes. I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months. As a matter of fact, there's been a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have been negotiating. I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering. I've reached the conclusion, too, based on the reports that have been made, that they may be cheating. I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster. There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out. But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue. I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait. I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: Our second round of questions begins with one from Mr. Edwards for the Vice President.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. EDWARDS: Mr. Nixon, carrying forward this business about a timetable; as you know, the pressures are increasing for a summit conference. Now, both you and Senator Kennedy have said that there are certain conditions which must be met before you would meet with Khrushchev. Will you be more specific about these conditions?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that. Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference. This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level. By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved. Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation. I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points. Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position. But let's look at the other side of the coin. If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace. We do not help it. We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit. I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have. And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is. When I say \\\"phony spirit,\\\" I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say. Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out. I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: Any comments, Senator Kennedy?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he'd go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement. He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament. He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin. The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous. I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing. In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States. The Soviet Union does understand strength. We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago. If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment. And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world. But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful. I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting. I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: We have time for only one or two more questions before the closing statements. Now Walter Cronkite's question for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CRONKITE: Senator, the charge has been made frequently that the United States for many years has been on the defensive around the world, that our policy has been uh - one of reaction to the Soviet Union rather than positive action on our own. What areas do you see where the United States might take the offensive in a challenge to Communism over the next four to eight years?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is - I have felt, has been Eastern Europe. I've been critical of the Administration's failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution. We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily. But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union. I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties. We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate. We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didn't pass the House. I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union. Secondly, the relations between Russia and China. They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest. No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully. If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world. Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world. India started from about the same place that China did. Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years. India under a free society has been making some progress. But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system. Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free. This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe. It's expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe. They want to be free. And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists. They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists. And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom. We can make it move. We can put the Communists on the defensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: Your comment, Mr. Vice President?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his. Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union. And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland. This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them. In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union. Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had. I would just like to s- add this one point. If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States. We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny. If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: John Chancellor's question for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. CHANCELLOR: Sir, I'd like to ask you an- another question about Quemoy and Matsu. Both you and Senator Kennedy say you agree with the President on this subject and with our treaty obligations. But the subject remains in the campaign as an issue. Now is - sir, is this because each of you feels obliged to respond to the other when he talks about Quemoy and Matsu, and if that's true, do you think an end should be called to this discussion, or will it stay with us as a campaign issue?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error. He says he supports the President's position. He says that he voted for the resolution. Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands. But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa. He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made. He repeated it again in a television debate that we had. Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here. Either he's for the President and he's against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine - and the Senator's position itself, stated the other day in our debate - either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated. Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say \\\"I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;\\\" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us. I support the President's position. I have always opposed drawing a line. I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want. And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up. It isn't enough for him to say \\\"I support the President's position, that I voted for the resolution.\\\" Of course, he voted for the resolution - it was virtually unanimous. But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate. It's very simple for him to clear it up. He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense. If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: Senator Kennedy, your comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955. The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands. Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed. The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw. I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands. General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States. The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish. Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible. Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw. Because he will not withdraw, because he's committed to these islands, because we've been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position. And therefore, the President's judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa. I support that. In view of the difficulties we've had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we've had with Chiang Kai-shek, that's the only position we can take. That's not the position you took, however. The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands. Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands. And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: Under the agreed\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: And that's the testimony of uh - General Twining and the Assistant Secretary of State in fifty-eight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: Under the agreed rules, gentlemen, we've exhausted the time for questions. Each candidate will now have four minutes and thirty seconds for his closing statement. Senator Kennedy will make the first final closing statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: I uh - said that I've served this country for fourteen years. I served it uh - in the war. I'm devoted to it. If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country. But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it's going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society. My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world. Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today. We had a recession in fifty-eight. We had a recession in fifty-four. We're not moving ahead in education the way we should. We didn't make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important. If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don't recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence. And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails. I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business. And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language. Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have. Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them. If that were true, why didn't we identify ourselves with the people of Africa? Why didn't we bring students over here? Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt? That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government. I believe that this party - Republican party - has stood still really for twenty-five years - its leadership has. It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest. And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt. He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead. I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still. We can no longer afford to be second best. I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we're on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again. I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do. I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom. And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny. And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: Now, Vice President Nixon, your closing statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still. America is not standing still. It has not been standing still. And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say. He talks about housing. We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration. We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration. Let's talk about civil rights. More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before. He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like. We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one. Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling in America. He's been in some other country. Let's get that straight right away. Now the second point we have to understand is this, however. America has not been standing still. But America cannot stand pat. We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated. We can't stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves. It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world. And this means more than what we've been doing. It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is. It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has. It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best. Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one. We had a good neighbor policy, yes. It sounded fine. But let's look at it. There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America. There are only three left. Let's look at Africa. Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration. Not one of them selected a Communist government. All of them voted for freedom - a free type of government. Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull? Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia? Of course not. What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side. We're on the side of freedom. We're on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice. But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements. Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead. One other point I would make: what could you do? Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States. And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president. What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president? It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster. It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people. In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great. And so I say in conclusion, keep America's faith strong. See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. HOWE: Thank you gentlemen. Both candidates have asked me to express their thanks to the networks for this opportunity to appear on this discussion. May I repeat that all those concerned in tonight's discussion have, sometimes reluctantly, followed the rules and conditions read at the outset and agreed to in advance by the candidates and the networks. The opening statements ran eight minutes each. The closing statements ran four minutes, thirty seconds. The order of speaking was reversed from their first joint appearance, when they followed the same procedure. A panel of newsmen questioned each candidate alternately. Each had two and a half minutes to reply. The other had a minute and a half to comment. But the first discussion dealt only with domestic policy. This one dealt only with foreign policy. One last word. As members of a new political generation, Vice President Nixon and Senator Kennedy have used new means of communication to pioneer a new type of political debate. The character and courage with which these two men have spoken sets a high standard for generations to come. Surely, they have set a new precedent. Perhaps they have established a new tradition. This is Quincy Howe. Good night from New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"October 21, 1960: Debate with Richard Nixon in New York\"},{\"doc_name\":\"october-22-1962-address-buildup-arms-cuba\",\"date\":\"1962-10-22\",\"transcript\":\"Good evening, my fellow citizens:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba. Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon receiving the first preliminary hard information of this nature last Tuesday morning at 9 a.m., I directed that our surveillance be stepped up. And having now confirmed and completed our evaluation of the evidence and our decision on a course of action, this Government feels obliged to report this new crisis to you in fullest detail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe characteristics of these new missile sites indicate two distinct types of installations. Several of them include medium range ballistic missiles, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead for a distance of more than 1,000 nautical miles. Each of these missiles, in short, is capable of striking Washington, D.C., the Panama Canal, Cape Canaveral, Mexico City, or any other city in the southeastern part of the United States, in Central America, or in the Caribbean area.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional sites not yet completed appear to be designed for intermediate range bailistic missiles--capable of traveling more than twice as far--and thus capable of striking most of the major cities in the Western Hemisphere, ranging as far north as Hudson Bay, Canada, and as far south as Lima, Peru. In addition, jet bombers, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, are now being uncrated and assembled in Cuba, while the necessary air bases are being prepared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis urgent transformation of Cuba into an important strategic base--by the presence of these large, long-range, and clearly offensive weapons of sudden mass destruction-constitutes an explicit threat to the peace and security of all the Americas, in flagrant and deliberate defiance of the Rio Pact of 1947, the traditions of this Nation and hemisphere, the joint resolution of the 87th Congress, the Charter of the United Nations, and my own public warnings to the Soviets on September 4 and 13. This action also contradicts the repeated assurances of Soviet spokesmen, both publicly and privately delivered, that the arms buildup in Cuba would retain its original defensive character, and that the Soviet Union had no need or desire to station strategic missiles on the territory of any other nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe size of this undertaking makes clear that it has been planned for some months. ? Yet only last month, after I had made clear the distinction between any introduction of ground-to-ground missiles and the existence of defensive antiaircraft missiles, the Soviet Government publicly stated on September 11 that, and I quote, \\\"the armaments and military equipment sent to Cuba are designed exclusively for defensive purposes,\\\" that, and I quote the Soviet Government, \\\"there is no need for the Soviet Government to shift its weapons . . . For a retaliatory blow to any other country, for instance Cuba,\\\" and that, and I quote their government, \\\"the Soviet Union has so powerful rockets to carry these nuclear warheads that there is no need to search for sites for them beyond the boundaries of the Soviet Union.\\\" That statement was false.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly last Thursday, as evidence of this rapid offensive buildup was already in my hand, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko told me in my office that he was instructed to make it clear once again, as he said his government had already done, that Soviet assistance to Cuba, and I quote, \\\"pursued solely the purpose of contributing to the defense capabilities of Cuba,\\\" that, and I quote him, \\\"training by Soviet specialists of Cuban nationals in handling defensive armaments was by no means offensive, and if it were otherwise,\\\" Mr. Gromyko went on, \\\"the Soviet Government would never become involved in rendering such assistance.\\\" That statement also was false.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither the United States of America nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or small. We no longer live in a world where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge to a nation's security to constitute maximum peril. Nuclear weapons are so destructive and ballistic missiles are so swift, that any substantially increased possibility of their use or any sudden change in their deployment may well be regarded as a definite threat to peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years, both the Soviet Union and the United States, recognizing this fact, have deployed strategic nuclear weapons with great care, never upsetting the precarious status quo which insured that these weapons would not be used in the absence of some vital challenge. Our own strategic missiles have never been transferred to the territory of any other nation under a cloak of secrecy and deception; and our history--unlike that of the Soviets since the end of World War II--demonstrates that we have no desire to dominate or conquer any other nation or impose our system upon its people. Nevertheless, American citizens have become adjusted to living daily on the bull's-eye of Soviet missiles located inside the U.S.S.R. or in submarines.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that sense, missiles in Cuba add to an already clear and present danger--although it should be noted the nations of Latin America have never previously been subjected to a potential nuclear threat.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this secret, swift, and extraordinary buildup of Communist missiles--in an area well known to have a special and historical relationship to the United States and the nations of the Western Hemisphere, in violation of Soviet assurances, and in defiance of American and hemispheric policy--this sudden, clandestine decision to station strategic weapons for the first time outside of Soviet soil--is a deliberately provocative and unjustified change in the status quo which cannot be accepted by this country, if our courage and our commitments are ever to be trusted again by either friend or foe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1930's taught us a clear lesson: aggressive conduct, if allowed to go unchecked and unchallenged, ultimately leads to war. This nation is opposed to war. We are also true to our word. Our unswerving objective, therefore, must be to prevent the use of these missiles against this or any other country, and to secure their withdrawal or elimination from the Western Hemisphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur policy has been one of patience and restraint, as befits a peaceful and powerful nation, which leads a worldwide alliance. We have been determined not to be diverted from our central concerns by mere irritants and fanatics. But now further action is required-and it is under way; and these actions may only be the beginning. We will not prematurely or unnecessarily risk the costs of worldwide nuclear war in which even the fruits of victory would be ashes in our mouth--but neither will we shrink from that risk at any time it must be faced.\\r\\n\\r\\nActing, therefore, in the defense of our own security and of the entire Western Hemisphere, and under the authority entrusted to me by the Constitution as endorsed by the resolution of the Congress, I have directed that the following initial steps be taken immediately:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back. This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers. We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond: I have directed the continued and increased close surveillance of Cuba and its military buildup. The foreign ministers of the OAS, in their communique of October 6, rejected secrecy on such matters in this hemisphere. Should these offensive military preparations continue, thus increasing the threat to the hemisphere, further action will be justified. I have directed the Armed Forces to prepare for any eventualities; and I trust that in the interest of both the Cuban people and the Soviet technicians at the sites, the hazards to all concerned of continuing this threat will be recognized.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird: It shall be the policy of this Nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth: As a necessary military precaution, I have reinforced our base at Guantanamo, evacuated today the dependents of our personnel there, and ordered additional military units to be on a standby alert basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth: We are calling tonight for an immediate meeting of the Organ of Consultation under the Organization of American States, to consider this threat to hemispheric security and to invoke articles 6 and 8 of the Rio Treaty in support of all necessary action. The United Nations Charter allows for regional security arrangements--and the nations of this hemisphere decided long ago against the military presence of outside powers. Our other allies around the world have also been alerted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixth: Under the Charter of the United Nations, we are asking tonight that an emergency meeting of the Security Council be convoked without delay to take action against this latest Soviet threat to world peace. Our resolution will call for the prompt dismantling and withdrawal of all offensive weapons in Cuba, under the supervision of U.N. observers, before the quarantine can be lifted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeventh and finally: I call upon Chairman Khrushchev to halt and eliminate this clandestine, reckless, and provocative threat to world peace and to stable relations between our two nations. I call upon him further to abandon this course of world domination, and to join in an historic effort to end the perilous arms race and to transform the history of man. He has an opportunity now to move the world back from the abyss of destruction--by returning to his government's own words that it had no need to station missiles outside its own territory, and withdrawing these weapons from Cuba by refraining from any action which will widen or deepen the present crisis--and then by participating in a search for peaceful and permanent solutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Nation is prepared to present its case against the Soviet threat to peace, and our own proposals for a peaceful world, at any time and in any forum--in the OAS, in the United Nations, or in any other meeting that could be useful--without limiting our freedom of action. We have in the past made strenuous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. We have proposed the elimination of all arms and military bases in a fair and effective disarmament treaty. We are prepared to discuss new proposals for the removal of tensions on both sides--including the possibilities of a genuinely independent Cuba, free to determine its own destiny. We have no wish to war with the Soviet Union-for we are a peaceful people who desire to live in peace with all other peoples.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is difficult to settle or even discuss these problems in an atmosphere of intimidation. That is why this latest Soviet threat--or any other threat which is made either independently or in response to our actions this week--must and will be met with determination. Any hostile move anywhere in the world against the safety and freedom of peoples to whom we are committed-including in particular the brave people of West Berlin--will be met by whatever action is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I want to say a few words to the captive people of Cuba, to whom this speech is being directly carried by special radio facilities. I speak to you as a friend, as one who knows of your deep attachment to your fatherland, as one who shares your aspirations for liberty and justice for all. And I have watched and the American people have watched with deep sorrow how your nationalist revolution was betrayed--and how your fatherland fell under foreign domination. Now your leaders are no longer Cuban leaders inspired by Cuban ideals. They are puppets and agents of an international conspiracy which has turned Cuba against your friends and neighbors in the Americas--and turned it into the first Latin American country to become a target for nuclear war--the first Latin American country to have these weapons on its soil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese new weapons are not in your interest. They contribute nothing to your peace and well-being. They can only undermine it. But this country has no wish to cause you to suffer or to impose any system upon you. We know that your lives and land are being used as pawns by those who deny your freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany times in the past, the Cuban people have risen to throw out tyrants who destroyed their liberty. And I have no doubt that most Cubans today look forward to the time when they will be truly free--free from foreign domination, free to choose their own leaders, free to select their own system, free to own their own land, free to speak and write and worship without fear or degradation. And then shall Cuba be welcomed back to the society of free nations and to the associations of this hemisphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow citizens: let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out. No one can foresee precisely what course it will take or what costs or casualties will be incurred. Many months of sacrifice and self-discipline lie ahead--months in which both our patience and our will be tested--months in which many threats and denunciations will keep us aware of our dangers. But the greatest danger of all would be to do nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards, as all paths are--but it is the one most consistent with our character and courage as a nation and our commitments around the world. The cost of freedom is always high--but Americans have always paid it. And one path we shall never choose, and that is the path of surrender or submission.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur goal is not the victory of might, but the vindication of right--not peace at the expense of freedom, but both peace and freedom, here in this hemisphere, and, we hope, around the world. God willing, that goal will be achieved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you and good night.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"October 22, 1962: Address on the Buildup of Arms in Cuba\"},{\"doc_name\":\"october-26-1963-remarks-amherst-college\",\"date\":\"1963-10-26\",\"transcript\":\"Mr. McCloy, President Plimpton, Mr. MacLeish, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:\\r\\nI am very honored to be here with you on this occasion which means so much to this college and also means so much to art and the progress of the United States. This college is part of the United States. It belongs to it. So did Mr. Frost, in a large sense. And, therefore, I was privileged to accept the invitation somewhat rendered to me in the same way that Franklin Roosevelt rendered his invitation to Mr. MacLeish, the invitation which I received from Mr. McCloy. The powers of the Presidency are often described. Its limitations should occasionally be remembered. And therefore when the Chairman of our Disarmament Advisory Committee, who has labored so long and hard, Governor Stevenson's assistant during the very difficult days at the United Nations during the Cuban crisis, a public servant of so many years, asks or invites the President of the United States, there is only one response. So I am glad to be here.\\r\\nAmherst has had many soldiers of the king since its first one, and some of them are here today: Mr. McCloy, who has long been a public servant; Jim Reed, who is the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury; President Cole, who is now our Ambassador to Chile; Mr. Ramey, who is a Commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission; Dick Reuter, who is head of the Food for Peace. These and scores of others down through the years have recognized the obligations of the advantages which the graduation from a college such as this places upon them to serve not only their private interest but the public interest as well.\\r\\nMany years ago, Woodrow Wilson said, what good is a political party unless it is serving a great national purpose? And what good is a private college or university unless it is serving a great national purpose? The library being constructed today, this college, itself—all of this, of course, was not done merely to give this school's graduates an advantage, an economic advantage, in the life struggle. It does do that. But in return for that, in return for the great opportunity which society gives the graduates of this and related schools, it seems to me incumbent upon this and other schools' graduates to recognize their responsibility to the public interest.\\r\\nPrivilege is here, and with privilege goes responsibility. And I think, as your president said, that it must be a source of satisfaction to you that this school's graduates have recognized it. I hope that the students who are here now will also recognize it in the future. Although Amherst has been in the forefront of extending aid to needy and talented students, private colleges, taken as a whole, draw 50 percent of their students from the wealthiest 10 percent of our Nation. And even State universities and other public institutions derive 25 percent of their students from this group. In March 1962, persons of 18 years or older who had not completed high school made up 46 percent of the total labor force, and such persons comprised 64 percent of those who were unemployed. And in 1958, the lowest fifth of the families in the United States had 41/2 percent of the total personal income, the highest fifth, 44 1/2 percent. There is inherited wealth in this country and also inherited poverty. And unless the graduates of this college and other colleges like it who are given a running start in life—unless they are willing to put back into our society those talents, the broad sympathy, the understanding, the compassion—unless they are willing to put those qualities back into the service of the Great Republic, then obviously the presuppositions upon which our democracy are based are bound to be fallible.\\r\\nThe problems which this country now faces are staggering, both at home and abroad. We need the service, in the great sense, of every educated man or woman to find 10 million jobs in the next 21/2 years, to govern our relations—a country which lived in isolation for 150 years, and is now suddenly the leader of the free world—to govern our relations with over 100 countries, to govern those relations with success so that the balance of power remains strong on the side of freedom, to make it possible for Americans of all different races and creeds to live together in harmony, to make it possible for a world to exist in diversity and freedom. All this requires the best of all of us.\\r\\nTherefore, I am proud to come to this college whose graduates have recognized this obligation and to say to those who are now here that the need is endless, and I am confident that you will respond.\\r\\nRobert Frost said:\\r\\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I—\\r\\nI took the one less traveled by,\\r\\nAnd that has made all the difference.\\r\\nI hope that road will not be the less traveled by, and I hope your commitment to the Great Republic's interest in the years to come will be worthy of your long inheritance since your beginning.\\r\\nThis day devoted to the memory of Robert Frost offers an opportunity for reflection which is prized by politicians as well as by others, and even by poets, for Robert Frost was one of the granite figures of our time in America. He was supremely two things: an artist and an American. A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors, the men it remembers.\\r\\nIn America, our heroes have customarily run to men of large accomplishments. But today this college and country honors a man whose contribution was not to our size but to our spirit, not to our political beliefs but to our insight, not to our self-esteem, but to our self-comprehension. In honoring Robert Frost, we therefore can pay honor to the deepest sources of our national strength. That strength takes many forms, and the most obvious forms are not always the most significant. The men who create power make an indispensable contribution to the Nation's greatness, but the men who question power make a contribution just as dispensable, especially when that questioning is disinterested, for they determine whether we use power or power uses us.\\r\\nOur national strength matters, but the spirit which informs and controls our strength matters just as much. This was the special significance of Robert Frost. He brought an unsparing instinct for reality to bear on the platitudes and pieties of society. His sense of the human tragedy fortified him against self-deception and easy consolation. \\\"I have been,\\\" he wrote, \\\"one acquainted with the night.\\\" And because he knew the midnight as well as the high noon, because he understood the ordeal as well as the triumph of the human spirit, he gave his age strength with which to overcome despair. At bottom, he held a deep faith in the spirit of man, and it is hardly an accident that Robert Frost coupled poetry and power, for he saw poetry as the means of saving power from itself. When power leads man towards arrogance, poetry reminds him of his limitations. When power narrows the areas of man's concern, poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of his existence. When power corrupts, poetry cleanses. For art establishes the basic human truth which must serve as the touchstone of our judgment.\\r\\nThe artist, however faithful to his personal vision of reality, becomes the last champion of the individual mind and sensibility against an intrusive society and an officious state. The great artist is thus a solitary figure. He has, as Frost said, a lover's quarrel with the world. In pursuing his perceptions of reality, he must often sail against the currents of his time. This is not a popular role. If Robert Frost was much honored during his lifetime, it was because a good many preferred to ignore his darker truths. Yet in retrospect, we see how the artist's fidelity has strengthened the fibre of our national life.\\r\\nIf sometimes our great artists have been the most critical of our society, it is because their sensitivity and their concern for justice, which must motivate any true artist, makes him aware that our Nation fails short of its highest potential. I see little of more importance to the future of our country and our civilization than full recognition of the place of the artist.\\r\\nIf art is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him. We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda; it is a form of truth. And as Mr. MacLeish once remarked of poets, there is nothing worse for our trade than to be in style. In free society art is not a weapon and it does not belong to the sphere of polemics and ideology. Artists are not engineers of the soul. It may be different elsewhere. But democratic society—in it, the highest duty of the writer, the composer, the artist is to remain true to himself and to let the chips fall where they may. In serving his vision of the truth, the artist best serves his nation. And the nation which disdains the mission of art invites the fate of Robert Frost's hired man, the fate of having \\\"nothing to look backward to with pride, and nothing to look forward to with hope.\\\"\\r\\nI look forward to a great future for America, a future in which our country will match its military strength with our moral restraint, its wealth with our wisdom, its power with our purpose. I look forward to an America which will not be afraid of grace and beauty, which will protect the beauty of our natural environment, which will preserve the great old American houses and squares and parks of our national past, and which will build handsome and balanced cities for our future.\\r\\nI look forward to an America which will reward achievement in the arts as we reward achievement in business or statecraft. I look forward to an America which will steadily raise the standards of artistic accomplishment and which will steadily enlarge cultural opportunities for all of our citizens. And I look forward to an America which commands respect throughout the world not only for its strength but for its civilization as well. And I look forward to a world which will be safe not only for democracy and diversity but also for personal distinction.\\r\\nRobert Frost was often skeptical about projects for human improvement, yet I do not think he would disdain this hope. As he wrote during the uncertain days of the Second War:\\r\\nTake human nature altogether since time began... And it must be a little more in favor of man, Say a fraction of one percent at the very least... Our hold on the planet wouldn't have so increased.\\r\\nBecause of Mr. Frost's life and work, because of the life and work of this college, our hold on this planet has increased.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"October 26, 1963: Remarks at Amherst College\"},{\"doc_name\":\"october-7-1960-debate-richard-nixon-washington-dc\",\"date\":\"1960-10-07\",\"transcript\":\"FRANK McGEE, MODERATOR: Good evening. This is Frank McGee, NBC News in Washington. This is the second in a series of programs unmatched in history. Never have so many people seen the major candidates for president of the United States at the same time; and never until this series have Americans seen the candidates in face-to-face exchange. Tonight the candidates have agreed to devote the full hour to answering questions on any issue of the campaign. And here tonight are: the Republican candidate, Vice President Richard M. Nixon; and the Democratic candidate, Senator John F. Kennedy. Now representatives of the candidates and of all the radio and television networks have agreed on these rules: neither candidate will make an opening statement or a closing summation; each will be questioned in turn; each will have an opportunity to comment upon the answer of the other; each reporter will ask only one question in turn. He is free to ask any question he chooses. Neither candidate knows what questions will be asked and only the clock will determine who will be asked the last question. These programs represent an unprecedented opportunity for the candidates to present their philosophies and programs directly to the people and for the people to compare these and the candidates. The four reporters on tonight's panel include a newspaperman and a wire service representative. These two were selected by lot by the press secretaries of the candidates from among the reporters traveling with the candidates. The broadcasting representatives were selected by their respective companies. The reporters are: Paul Niven of CBS, Edward P. Morgan of ABC, Alvin Spivak of United Press International, and Harold R. Levy of Newsday. Now the first question is from Mr. Niven and is for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIVEN: Mr. Vice President, Senator Kennedy said last night that the Administration must take responsibility for the loss of Cuba. Would you compare the validity of that statement with the validity of your own statements in previous campaigns that the Truman Administration was responsible for the loss of China to the Communists?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Well first of all, I don't agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953. As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States. Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part - or alleged part - in what has happened in Cuba. He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there. I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we're glad to have a comparison with the previous administration. There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953. Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba. We think that's pretty good progress. Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country. Now I'm very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind. As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position. And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well. For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty. Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear. There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there. There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked. There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom. No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Senator Kennedy, would you care to comment?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: In the first place I've never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present. In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free. Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years. Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections. What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958. Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results. Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom. I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Morgan, with a question for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORGAN: Senator, last May, in Oregon, you discussed the possibilities of sending apologies or regrets to Khrushchev over the U-2 incident. Do you think now that that would have done any good? Did you think so then?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets. In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions. Mr. Lodge, on \\\"Meet the Press\\\" a month ago, said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the U-2 incident. The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security. But they were not in accordance with international law. And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is. The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets - the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets - for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958. We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration. The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident. The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956. That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly. I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action. It's not appeasement. It's not soft. I believe we should be stronger than we now are. I believe we should have a stronger military force. I believe we should increase our strength all over the world. But I don't confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told - which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards - it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Vice President.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts. First of all, he's wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets. He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn't the reason that he broke up the conference. Second, he's wrong in the analogies that he makes. The United States is a strong country. Whenever we do anything that's wrong, we can express regrets. But when the president of the United States is doing something that's right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev. Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference - or immediately before the summit conference occurred. This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part. We all remember Pearl Harbor. We lost three thousand American lives. We cannot afford an intelligence gap. And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information. I don't intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we're negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort. And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Spivak with a question for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SPIVAK: Mr. Vice President, you have accused Senator Kennedy of avoiding the civil rights issue when he has been in the South and he has accused you of the same thing. With both North and South listening and watching, would you sum up uh - your own intentions in the field of civil rights if you become president.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform. I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment. And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts. Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed. Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools. That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active. And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership. And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes. Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody. I have talked to Negro mothers. I've heard them explain - try to explain - how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can't go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola. This is wrong, and we have to do something about it. So, under the circumstances, what do we do? Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action. Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights? Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us. I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together. I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country - a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands - we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens. And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954? Giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question. Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment? He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia. He has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country, so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color. Nor has he indicated that he will support Title Three, which would give the Attorney General additional powers to protect Constitutional rights. These are the great questions: equality of education in school. About two percent of our population of white people are - is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population. Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school. These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know. What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment? Equality of opportunity in the field of housing, which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the president's pen. What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States? Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership. And I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Levy with a question for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. LEVY: Senator, on the same subject, in the past you have emphasized the president's responsibility as a moral leader as well as an executive on civil rights questions. What specifically might the next president do uh - in the event of an uh - an occurrence such as Little Rock or the lunch-counter sit-ins? From the standpoint of MR, KENNEDY: Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas. First, as a legislative leader. And as I just said that I believe that the passage of the so-called Title Three, which gives the Attorney General the power to protect Constitutional rights in those cases where it's not possible for the person involved to bring the suit. Secondly, as an executive leader. There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960. The right to vote is basic. I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor. Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor. Everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring. And that's in all sections of the United States. And then fourthly, as a moral leader. There is a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity. We are in a very difficult time. We need all the talent we can get. We sit on a conspicuous stage. We are a goldfish bowl before the world. We have to practice what we preach. We set a very high standard for ourselves. The Communists do not. They set a low standard of materialism. We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we're not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards. I believe the president of the United States should indicate it. Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock. I would have hoped that the president of the United States would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh - the Supreme Court decision was going to be carried out. I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so. But it wou- uh - evidently uh - under the handling of the case it was not. I would hope an incident like that would not happen. I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned - with deliberate speed - then in my judgment, providing he's behind action, I believe we can make uh - progress. Now the present Administration - the President - has said - never indicated what he thought of the 1954 decision. Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: \\\"The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership.\\\" And I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Vice President.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area. But let's look at the performance. When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time. Let me s- look also at what I did. I selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it. Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts. And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff. Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it. All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes. What we need is action. And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Morgan with a question for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORGAN: Mr. Vice President, in your speeches you emphasize that the United States is doing basically well in the cold war. Can you square that statement with a considerable mass of bipartisan reports and studies, including one prominently participated in by Governor Rockefeller, which almost unanimously conclude that we are not doing nearly so well as we should?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should. And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following. Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it's time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out. First of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low. Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again. I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchev's uh - performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhower's eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high. Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one. When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo. We were on one side; they were on the other side. What happened? There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs. Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years. That's a test of prestige. Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained. Now looking to what we ought to do in the future. In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it. It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America. What do we need? What tools do we need to fight us? Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area. Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America. I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs. They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years. They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense. Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well. So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men. It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological. But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense. Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses. I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces. The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago. Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations. We all know about the vote held this week - of the five neutralists - and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States. Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations. Last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it. We have not maintained our position and our prestige. A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970. Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been. The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Spivak with a question for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SPIVAK: Senator, uh - following this up, how would you go about increasing the prestige you say we're losing, and could the programs you've devised to do so be accomplished without absolutely wrecking our economy?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Yes. We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months. The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S. meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba. And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people. Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos. We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists. I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency. This permits them to maintain their self-respect. It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth. And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be. I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund. And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that. We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed. And unless we're ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost. And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us. I think the United States can afford to do these things. I think that we could not afford not to do these things. This goes to our survival. And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas. I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example. I believe we can do it. If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Vice President.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance. This is important. But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation. We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies. We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries. We must associate ourselves with their aspirations. We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody. This we must get across to the world. And we can't do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance. The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone. This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men. We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism. We must stand for our ideals.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Levy with a question for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. LEVY; Mr. Vice President, the Labor Department today added five more major industrial centers to the list of areas with substantial unemployment. You said in New York this week that as president you would use the full powers of the government, if necessary, to combat unemployment. Specifically what measures would you advocate and at what point?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas. Now in the last Congress - the special session of the Congress - there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party. Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting. On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken. So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress. I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign. Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is. In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education. It also exists among minority groups. If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas. That's why I have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens. Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession. I believe this economy is sound and that we're going to move up. But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy. This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs. I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period. So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come. But I do not expect it to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill. I'm very familiar with it. It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman - the labor subcommittee - in fifty-five. I was the floor manager. We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times. We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives. Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia. Our bill was far more effective. The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas. Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens. I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security. Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work. Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person. Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960. If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed. One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education. The other would be to make a judgment on what's the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Niven with a question for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIVEN: Senator, while the main theme of your campaign has been this decline of American power and prestige in the last eight years, you've hardly criticized President Eisenhower at all. And in a speech last weekend you said you had no quarrel with the President. Now isn't Mr. Eisenhower and not Mr. Nixon responsible for any such decline?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh - propaganda that I've read. The question is what we're going to do in the future. I've been critical of this Administration and I've been critical of the President. In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech. I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined. Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future. Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself. He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead. I disagree. And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we're doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon's view. That's the great issue. President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years. And that's the debate. That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment. I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century. Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties. If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America. In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh - Africa. We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before. Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything. We've been uh - having a very clear decision in the last eight years. Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration. He's had experience in it. And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom. I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Vice President.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility. In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions. I'm glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience. Let me make my position cl ear. I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration. I'm proud of the record of this Administration. I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on. Now looking at Senator Kennedy's credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will. But what does he offer? He offers retreads of programs that failed. I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration. And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one. I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now. I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies. And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Spivak with a question for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SPIVAK: Mr. Vice President, according to news dispatches Soviet Premier Khrushchev said today that Prime Minister Macmillan had assured him that there would be a summit conference next year after the presidential elections. Have you given any cause for such assurance, and do you consider it desirable or even possible that there would be a summit conference next year if Mr. Khrushchev persists in the conditions he's laid down?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: No, of course I haven't talked to Prime Minister Macmillan. It would not be appropriate for me to do so. The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period. As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear. I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace. I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success. We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris. There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up. He was going to break it up because he would - knew that he wasn't going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference. Now, if we're going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level - the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level - prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress. Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped. So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev - after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations - gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that. It - my view is the same as his. Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add. That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength. If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions. Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin. It's going to be a test of our nerve and will. It's going to be a test of our strength. And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty. On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon. I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Levy with a question for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. LEVY: Senator, in your acceptance speech at Los Angeles, you said that your campaign would be based not on what you intend to offer the American people, but what you intend to ask of them. Since that time you have spelled out many of the things that you intend to do but you have made only vague reference to sacrifice and self-denial. A year or so ago, I believe, you said that you would not hesitate to recommend a tax increase if you considered it necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: That's right.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. LEVY: Is this what you have in mind?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable. In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy. If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States. I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens. I'm talking about a national mood. I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe. We don't know what the future's going to bring. But I would not want anyone to elect me uh - president of the United States - or vote for me - under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected. Now, many of the programs that I'm talking about - economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources - build the strength of the United States. That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period. If we're moving ahead, if we're providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country's on the move, then we're stronger, then we set a better example to the world. So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home. So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States. We're using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today. We're not able to consume what we're able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains. And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States. And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life. I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Vice President.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties. Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less. In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater. I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes. I hope not. I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don't have to. But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 - if necessary - to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar. Because when you do not tax, and tax enough to pay for your outgo, you pay it many times over in higher prices and inflation; and I simply will not do that. I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both. The platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth; that it can be done, in effect, with mirrors. But it isn't going to be working that way. You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it. After all, it isn't paid for by my money, it isn't paid for by his, but by the people's money.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Niven with a question for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIVEN: Mr. Vice President, you said that while Mr. Khrushchev is here, Senator Kennedy should talk about what's right with this country as well as what's wrong with the country. In the 1952 campaign when you were Republican candidate for Vice President, and we were eh - at war with the Communists, did you feel a similar responsibility to t- talk about what was right with the country?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: I did. And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary. What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea. Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy. He's said that it's been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat. And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated? In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China. In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world. I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong. But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case. I don't think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low. I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong. I don't think it was helpful when he suggested - and I'm glad he's corrected this to an extent - that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States. Now this just wasn't true. Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration. But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world. We're the best fed; we're the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world's goods to all of our people than any people in history. Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths. It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up. Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong. And he's doing a very effective job of that, in his way. But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate. And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet. Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet. And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat. Now I've seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed. You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate. You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed. I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food. And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter. And we ought to try to meet the problem. Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost. They're wholly inaccurate. I said last week I believed in a balanced budget. Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States. So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Morgan with a question for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. MORGAN: Senator, Saturday on television you said that you had always thought that Quemoy and Matsu were unwise places to draw our defense line in the Far East. Would you comment further on that and also address to this question; couldn't a pullback from those islands be interpreted as appeasement?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, the United States uh - has on occasion attempted uh - mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa. I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa. These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa. We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked. We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa. But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment. Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible. Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East. General Ridgway has said the same thing. I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line. One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked. I believe that we should defend Formosa. We should come to its defense. To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake. Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun. It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa. It leaves a hundred miles between the sea. But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it's unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa. I think that uh - we should protect our commitments. I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin. I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed. But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa. And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Mr. Vice President.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point. I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well. Generals testified to that. And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States. I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war. But it didn't mean that. We had to go in when they came in. Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant. It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important. It's the principle involved. These two islands are in the area of freedom. The Nationalists have these two islands. We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists. If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists aren't after Quemoy and Matsu, they're a- they're after Formosa. In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea. I am against it. I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Gentlemen, we have approximately four minutes remaining. May I ask you to make your questions and answers as brief as possible consistent with clarity. And Mr. Levy has a question for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. LEVY: Mr. Vice President, you are urging voters to forget party labels and vote for the man. Senator Kennedy says that in doing this you are trying to run away from your party on such issues as housing and aid to education by advocating what he calls a me-too program. Why do you say that party labels are not important?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON; Because that's the way we elect a president in this country, and it's the way we should. I'm a student of history as is Senator Kennedy, incidentally; and I have found that in the history of this country we've had many great presidents. Some of them have been Democrats and some of them have been Republicans. The people, some way, have always understood that at a particular time a certain man was the one the country needed. Now, I believe that in an election when we are trying to determine who should lead the free world - not just America - perhaps, as Senator Kennedy has already indicated, the most important election in our history - it isn't the label that he wears or that I wear that counts. It's what we are. It's our whole lives. It's what we stand for. It's what we believe. And consequently, I don't think it's enough to go before Republican audiences - and I never do - and say, \\\"Look, vote for me because I'm a Republican.\\\" I don't think it's enough for Senator Kennedy to go before the audiences on the Democratic side and say, \\\"Vote for me because I'm a Democrat.\\\" That isn't enough. What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world. Now that means the best leadership. It may be Republican, it may be Democratic. But the people are the ones that determine it. The people have to make up their minds. And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, \\\"Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did.\\\" I think the people should put America first, rather than party first. Now, as far as running away from my party is concerned, Senator Kennedy has said that we have no compassion for the poor, that we are against progress - the enemies of progress, is the term that he's used, and the like. All that I can say is this: we do have programs in all of these fields - education, housing, defense - that will move America forward. They will move her forward faster, and they will move her more surely than in his program. This is what I deeply believe. I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way. I suggest, however, that in the interest of fairness that he could give me the benefit of also believing as he believes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man. Abraham Lincoln was a great president of all the people; but he was selected by his party at a key time in history because his party stood for something. The Democratic party in this century has stood for something. It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare. It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman. The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon. They do stand for something. They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad. That's the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record. And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. McGEE: Thank you gentlemen. Neither the questions from the reporters nor the answers you heard from Senator John Kennedy or Vice President Richard Nixon were rehearsed. By agreement neither candidate made an opening statement or a closing summation. They further agreed that the clock alone would decide who would speak last and each has asked me to express his thanks to the networks and their affiliated stations. Another program similar to this one will be presented Thursday, October thirteenth, and the final program will be presented Friday, October twenty-first. We hope this series of radio and television programs will help you toward a fuller understanding of the issues facing our country today and that on election day, November eighth, you will vote for the candidate of your choice. This is Frank McGee. Good night from Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"October 7, 1960: Debate with Richard Nixon in Washington, D.C.\"},{\"doc_name\":\"september-12-1960-address-greater-houston-ministerial\",\"date\":\"1960-09-12\",\"transcript\":\"Reverend Meza, Reverend Reck, I'm grateful for your generous invitation to speak my views.\\r\\nWhile the so-called religious issue is necessarily and properly the chief topic here tonight, I want to emphasize from the outset that we have far more critical issues to face in the 1960 election; the spread of Communist influence, until it now festers 90 miles off the coast of Florida—the humiliating treatment of our President and Vice President by those who no longer respect our power—the hungry children I saw in West Virginia, the old people who cannot pay their doctor bills, the families forced to give up their farms—an America with too many slums, with too few schools, and too late to the moon and outer space.\\r\\nThese are the real issues which should decide this campaign. And they are not religious issues—for war and hunger and ignorance and despair know no religious barriers.\\r\\nBut because I am a Catholic, and no Catholic has ever been elected President, the real issues in this campaign have been obscured—perhaps deliberately, in some quarters less responsible than this. So it is apparently necessary for me to state once again—not what kind of church I believe in, for that should be important only to me—but what kind of America I believe in.\\r\\nI believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute—where no Catholic prelate would tell the President (should he be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote—where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference—and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the President who might appoint him or the people who might elect him.\\r\\nI believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish—where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source—where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials—and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all.\\r\\nFor while this year it may be a Catholic against whom the finger of suspicion is pointed, in other years it has been, and may someday be again, a Jew—or a Quaker—or a Unitarian—or a Baptist. It was Virginia's harassment of Baptist preachers, for example, that helped lead to Jefferson's statute of religious freedom. Today I may be the victim—but tomorrow it may be you—until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped at a time of great national peril.\\r\\nFinally, I believe in an America where religious intolerance will someday end—where all men and all churches are treated as equal—where every man has the same right to attend or not attend the church of his choice—where there is no Catholic vote, no anti-Catholic vote, no bloc voting of any kind—and where Catholics, Protestants and Jews, at both the lay and pastoral level, will refrain from those attitudes of disdain and division which have so often marred their works in the past, and promote instead the American ideal of brotherhood.\\r\\nThat is the kind of America in which I believe. And it represents the kind of Presidency in which I believe—a great office that must neither be humbled by making it the instrument of any one religious group nor tarnished by arbitrarily withholding its occupancy from the members of any one religious group. I believe in a President whose religious views are his own private affair, neither imposed by him upon the Nation or imposed by the Nation upon him as a condition to holding that office.\\r\\nI would not look with favor upon a President working to subvert the first amendment's guarantees of religious liberty. Nor would, our system of checks and balances permit him to do so—and neither do I look with favor upon those who would work to subvert Article VI of the Constitution by requiring a religious test—even by indirection—for it. If they disagree with that safeguard they should be out openly working to repeal it.\\r\\nI want a Chief Executive whose public acts are responsible to all groups and obligated to none—who can attend any ceremony, service, or dinner his office may appropriately require of him—and whose fulfillment of his Presidential oath is not limited or conditioned by any religious oath, ritual, or obligation.\\r\\nThis is the kind of America I believe in—and this is the kind I fought for in the South Pacific, and the kind my brother died for in Europe. No one suggested then that we might have a \\\"divided loyalty,\\\" that we did \\\"not believe in liberty\\\" or that we belonged to a disloyal group that threatened the \\\"freedoms for which our forefathers died.\\\"\\r\\nAnd in fact this is the kind of America for which our forefathers died—when they fled here to escape religious test oaths that denied office to members of less favored churches—when they fought for the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom—and when they fought at the shrine I visited today, the Alamo. For side by side with Bowie and Crockett died McCafferty and Bailey and Carey—but no one knows whether they were Catholics or not. For there was no religious test at the Alamo.\\r\\nI ask you tonight to follow in that tradition—to judge me on the basis of my record of 14 years in Congress—on my declared stands against an Ambassador to the Vatican, against unconstitutional aid to parochial schools, and against any boycott of the public schools (which I have attended myself)—instead of judging me on the basis of these pamphlets and publications we all have seen that carefully select quotations out of context from the statements of Catholic church leaders, usually in other countries, frequently in other centuries, and always omitting, of course, the statement of the American Bishops in 1948 which strongly endorsed church-state separation, and which more nearly reflects the views of almost every American Catholic.\\r\\nI do not consider these other quotations binding upon my public acts—why should you? But let me say, with respect to other countries, that I am wholly opposed to the state being used by any religious group, Catholic or Protestant, to compel, prohibit, or persecute the free exercise of any other religion. And I hope that you and I condemn with equal fervor those nations which deny their Presidency to Protestants and those which deny it to Catholics. And rather than cite the misdeeds of those who differ, I would cite the record of the Catholic Church in such nations as Ireland and France—and the independence of such statesmen as Adenauer and De Gaulle.\\r\\nBut let me stress again that these are my views—for, contrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who happens also to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters—and the Church does not speak for me.\\r\\nWhatever issue may come before me as President—in birth control, divorce, censorship, gambling or any other subject—I will make my decision in accordance with these views, in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be the national interest, and without regard to outside religious pressures or dictates. And no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise.\\r\\nBut if the time should ever come—and I do not concede any conflict to be even remotely possible—when my office would require me to either violate my conscience or violate the national interest, then I would resign the office; and I hope any conscientious public servant would do the same.\\r\\nBut I do not intend to apologize for these views to my critics of either Catholic or Protestant faith—nor do I intend to disavow either my views or my Church in order to win this election.\\r\\nIf I should lose on the real issues, I shall return to my seat in the Senate, satisfied that I had tried my best and was fairly judged. But if this election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans lost their chance of being President on the day they were baptized, then it is the whole Nation that will be the loser, in the eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics around the world, in the eyes of history, and in the eyes of our own people.\\r\\nBut if, on the other hand, I should win the election, then I shall devote every effort of mind and spirit to fulfilling the oath of the Presidency—practically identical, I might add, to the oath I have taken for 14 years in the Congress. For, without reservation, I can \\\"solemly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, so help me God.\\\"\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"September 12, 1960: Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association\"},{\"doc_name\":\"september-12-1962-address-space-effort\",\"date\":\"1962-09-12\",\"transcript\":\"President Pitzer, Mr. Vice President, Governor, Congressman Thomas, Senator Wiley, and Congressman Miller, Mr. Webb. Mr. Bell, scientists, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen:\\r\\nI appreciate your president having made me an honorary visiting professor, and I will assure you that my first lecture will be very brief.\\r\\nI am delighted to be here and I'm particularly delighted to be here on this occasion.\\r\\nWe meet at a college noted for knowledge, in a city noted for progress, in a State noted for strength, and we stand in need of all three, for we meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and ignorance. The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds.\\r\\nDespite the striking fact that most of the scientists that the world has ever known are alive and working today, despite the fact that this Nation's own scientific manpower is doubling every 12 years in a rate of growth more than three times that of our population as a whole, despite that, the vast stretches of the unknown and the unanswered and the unfinished still far outstrip our collective comprehension.\\r\\nNo man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come, but condense, if you will, the 50,000 years of man's recorded history in a time span of but a half-century. Stated in these terms, we know very little about the first 40 years, except at the end of them advanced man had learned to use the skins of animals to cover them. Then about 10 years ago, under this standard, man emerged from his caves to construct other kinds of shelter. Only 5 years ago man learned to write and use a cart with wheels. Christianity began less than 2 years ago. The printing press came this year, and then less than 2 months ago, during this whole 50-year span of human history, the steam engine provided a new source of power.\\r\\nNewton explored the meaning of gravity. Last month electric lights and telephones and automobiles and airplanes became available. Only last week did we develop penicillin and television and nuclear power, and now if America's new spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus, we will have literally reached the stars before midnight tonight.\\r\\nThis is a breathtaking pace, and such a pace cannot help but create new ills as it dispels old, new ignorance, new problems, new dangers. Surely the opening vistas of space promise high costs and hardships, as well as high reward.\\r\\nSo it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest, to wait. But this city of Houston, this State of Texas, this country of the United States was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them. This country was conquered by those who moved forward—and so will space.\\r\\nWilliam Bradford, speaking in 1630 of the founding of the Plymouth Bay Colony, said that all great and honorable actions are accompanied with great difficulties, and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage.\\r\\nIf this capsule history of our progress teaches us anything, it is that man, in his quest for knowledge and progress, is determined and cannot be deterred. The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in it or not, and it is one of the great adventures of all time, and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space.\\r\\nThose who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions, the first waves of modern invention, and the first wave of nuclear power, and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space. We mean to be a part of it—we mean to lead it. For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.\\r\\nYet the vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we in this Nation are first, and, therefore, we intend to be first. In short, our leadership in science and in industry, our hopes for peace and security, our obligations to ourselves as well as others, all require us to make this effort, to solve these mysteries, to solve them for the good of all men, and to become the world's leading space-faring nation.\\r\\nWe set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people. For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war. I do not say that we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea, but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.\\r\\nThere is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain. Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?\\r\\nWe choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.\\r\\nIt is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space from low to high gear as among the most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the Office of the Presidency.\\r\\nIn the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the greatest and most complex exploration in man's history. We have felt the ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1 booster rocket, many times as powerful as the Atlas which launched John Glenn, generating power equivalent to 10,000 automobiles with their accelerators on the floor. We have seen the site where five F-1 rocket engines, each one as powerful as all eight engines of the Saturn combined, will be clustered together to make the advanced Saturn missile, assembled in a new building to be built at Cape Canaveral as tall as a 48-story structure, as wide as a city block, and as long as two lengths of this field.\\r\\nWithin these last 19 months at least 45 satellites have circled the earth. Some 40 of them were \\\"made in the United States of America\\\" and they were far more sophisticated and supplied far more knowledge to the people of the world than those of the Soviet Union.\\r\\nThe Mariner spacecraft now on its way to Venus is the most intricate instrument in the history of space science. The accuracy of that shot is comparable to firing a missile from Cape Canaveral and dropping it in this stadium between the 40-yard lines.\\r\\nTransit satellites are helping our ships at sea to steer a safer course. Tiros satellites have given us unprecedented warnings of hurricanes and storms, and will do the same for forest fires and icebergs.\\r\\nWe have had our failures, but so have others, even if they do not admit them. And they may be less public.\\r\\nTo be sure, we are behind, and will be behind for some time in manned flight. But we do not intend to stay behind, and in this decade we shall make up and move ahead.\\r\\nThe growth of our science and education will be enriched by new knowledge of our universe and environment, by new techniques of learning and mapping and observation, by new tools and computers for industry, medicine, the home as well as the school. Technical institutions, such as Rice, will reap the harvest of these gains.\\r\\nAnd finally, the space effort itself, while still in its infancy, has already created a great number of new companies, and tens of thousands of new jobs. Space and related industries are generating new demands in investment and skilled personnel, and this city and this State, and this region, will share greatly in this growth. What was once the furthest outpost on the old frontier of the West will be the furthest outpost on the new frontier of science and space. Houston, your City of Houston, with its Manned Spacecraft Center, will become the heart of a large scientific and engineering community. During the next 5 years the National Aeronautics and Space Administration expects to double the number of scientists and engineers in this area, to increase its outlays for salaries and expenses to $60 million a year; to invest some $200 million in plant and laboratory facilities; and to direct or contract for new space efforts over $1 billion from this Center in this City.\\r\\nTo be sure, all this costs us all a good deal of money. This year's space budget is three times what it was in January 1961, and it is greater than the space budget of the previous 8 years combined. That budget now stands at $5,400 million a year—a staggering sum, though somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year. Space expenditures will soon rise some more, from 40 cents per person per week to more than 50 cents a week for every man, woman, and child in the United States, for we have given this program a high national priority—even though I realize that this is in some measure an act of faith and vision, for we do not now know what benefits await us. But if I were to say, my fellow citizens, that we shall send to the moon, 240,000 miles away from the control station in Houston, a giant rocket more than 300 feet tall, the length of this football field, made of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been invented, capable of standing heat and stresses several times more than have ever been experienced, fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch, carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion, guidance, control, communications, food and survival, on an untried mission, to an unknown celestial body, and then return it safely to earth, reentering the atmosphere at speeds of over 25,000 miles per hour, causing heat about half that of the temperature of the sun—almost as hot as it is here today—and do all this, and do it right, and do it first before this decade is out, then we must be bold.\\r\\nI'm the one who is doing all the work, so we just want you to stay cool for a minute. [Laughter]\\r\\nHowever, I think we're going to do it, and I think that we must pay what needs to be paid. I don't think we ought to waste any money, but I think we ought to do the job. And this will be done in the decade of the sixties. It may be done while some of you are still here at school at this college and university. It will be done during the terms of office of some of the people who sit here on this platform. But it will be done. And it will be done before the end of this decade.\\r\\nI am delighted that this university is playing a part in putting a man on the moon as part of a great national effort of the United States of America.\\r\\nMany years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to die on Mount Everest, was asked why did he want to climb it. He said, \\\"Because it is there.\\\"\\r\\nWell, space is there, and we're going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there. And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God's blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked.\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F.

The freedom of West Berlin was in immediate peril. Agreement on a neutral Laos seemed remote. The mandate of the United Nations in the Congo was under fire. The financial outlook for this organization was in doubt. Dag Hammarskjold was dead. The doctrine of troika was being pressed in his place, and atmospheric nuclear tests had been resumed by the Soviet Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose were anxious days for mankind-and some men wondered aloud whether this organization could survive. But the 16th and 17th General Assemblies achieved not only survival but progress. Rising to its responsibility, the United Nations helped reduce the tensions and helped to hold back the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday the clouds have lifted a little so that new rays of hope can break through. The pressures on West Berlin appear to be temporarily eased. Political unity in the Congo has been largely restored. A neutral coalition in Laos, while still in difficulty, is at least in being. The integrity of the United Nations Secretariat has been reaffirmed. A United Nations Decade of Development is under way. And, for the first time in 17 years of effort, a specific step has been taken to limit the nuclear arms race.\\r\\n\\r\\nI refer, of course, to the treaty to ban nuclear tests in the atmosphere, outer space, and under water--concluded by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States--and already signed by nearly 100 countries. It has been hailed by people the world over who are thankful to be free from the fears of nuclear fallout, and I am confident that on next Tuesday at 10:30 o'clock in the morning it will receive the overwhelming endorsement of the Senate of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world has not escaped from the darkness. The long shadows of conflict and crisis envelop us still. But we meet today in an atmosphere of rising hope, and at a moment of comparative calm. My presence here today is not a sign of crisis, but of confidence. I am not here to report on a new threat to the peace or new signs of war. I have come to salute the United Nations and to show the support of the American people for your daily deliberations.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the value of this body's work is not dependent on the existence of emergencies-nor can the winning of peace consist only of dramatic victories. Peace is a daily, a weekly, a monthly process, gradually changing opinions, slowly eroding old barriers, quietly building new structures. And however undramatic the pursuit of peace, that pursuit must go on.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday we may have reached a pause in the cold war--but that is not a lasting peace. A test ban treaty is a milestone--but it is not the millennium. We have not been released from our obligations--we have been given an opportunity. And if we fail to make the most of this moment and this momentum-if we convert our new-found hopes and understandings into new walls and weapons of hostility--if this .pause in the cold war merely leads to its renewal and not to its end--then the indictment of posterity will rightly point its finger at us all. But if we can stretch this pause into a period of cooperation--if both sides can now gain new confidence and experience in concrete collaborations for peace--if we can now be as bold and farsighted in the control of deadly weapons as we have been in their creation-then surely this first small step can be the start of a long and fruitful journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe task of building the peace lies with the leaders of every nation, large and small. For the great powers have no monopoly on conflict or ambition. The cold war is not the only expression of tension in this world-and the nuclear race is not the only arms race. Even little wars are dangerous in a nuclear world. The long labor of peace is an undertaking for every nation--and in this effort none of us can remain unaligned. To this goal none can be uncommitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reduction of global tension must not be an excuse for the narrow pursuit of self-interest. If the Soviet Union and the United States, with all of their global interests and clashing commitments of ideology, and with nuclear weapons still aimed at each other today, can find areas of common interest and agreement, then surely other nations can do the same--nations caught in regional conflicts, in racial issues, or in the death throes of old colonialism. Chronic disputes which divert precious resources from the needs of the people or drain the energies of both sides serve the interests of no one--and the badge of responsibility in the modern world is a willingness to seek peaceful solutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is never too early to try; and it's never too late to talk; and it's high time that many disputes on the agenda of this Assembly were taken off the debating schedule and placed on the negotiating table.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact remains that the United States, as a major nuclear power, does have a special responsibility in the world. It is, in fact, a threefold responsibility--a responsibility to our own citizens; a responsibility to the people of the whole world who are affected by our decisions; and to the next generation of humanity. We believe the Soviet Union also has these special responsibilities--and that those responsibilities require our two nations to concentrate less on our differences and more on the means of resolving them peacefully. For too long both of us have increased our military budgets, our nuclear stockpiles, and our capacity to destroy all life on this hemisphere--human, animal, vegetable--without any corresponding increase in our security.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur conflicts, to be sure, are real. Our concepts of the world are different. No service is performed by failing to make clear our disagreements. A central difference is the belief of the American people in self-determination for all people.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe believe that the people of Germany and Berlin must be free to reunite their capital and their country.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe believe that the people of Cuba must be free to secure the fruits of the revolution that have been betrayed from within and exploited from without.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, we believe that all the world--in Eastern Europe as well as Western, in Southern Africa as well as Northern, in old nations as well as new--that people must be free to choose their own future, without discrimination or dictation, without coercion or subversion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the basic differences between the Soviet Union and the United States, and they cannot be concealed. So long as they exist, they set limits to agreement, and they forbid the relaxation of our vigilance. Our defense around the world will be maintained for the protection of freedom--and our determination to safeguard that freedom will measure up to any threat or challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I would say to the leaders of the Soviet Union, and to their people, that if either of our countries is to be fully secure, we need a much better weapon than the H-bomb--a weapon better than ballistic missiles or nuclear submarines--and that better weapon is peaceful cooperation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have, in recent years, agreed on a limited test ban treaty, on an emergency communications link between our capitals, on a statement of principles for disarmament, on an increase in cultural exchange, on cooperation in outer space, on the peaceful exploration of the Antarctic, and on tempering last year's crisis over Cuba.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe, therefore, that the Soviet Union and the United States, together with their allies, can achieve further agreements-agreements which spring from our mutual interest in avoiding mutual destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can be no doubt about the agenda of further steps. We must continue to seek agreements on measures which prevent war by accident or miscalculation. We must continue to seek agreement on safeguards against surprise attack, including observation posts at key points. We must continue to seek agreement on further measures to curb the nuclear arms race, by controlling the transfer of nuclear weapons, converting fissionable materials to peaceful purposes, and banning underground testing, with adequate inspection and enforcement. We must continue to seek agreement on a freer flow of information and people from East to West and West to East.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must continue to seek agreement, encouraged by yesterday's affirmative response to this proposal by the Soviet Foreign Minister, on an arrangement to keep weapons of mass destruction out of outer space. Let us get our negotiators back to the negotiating table to work out a practicable arrangement to this end.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these and other ways, let us move up the steep and difficult path toward comprehensive disarmament, securing mutual confidence through mutual verification, and building the institutions of peace as we dismantle the engines of war. We must not let failure to agree on all points delay agreements where agreement is possible. And we must not put forward proposals for propaganda purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, in a field where the United States and the Soviet Union have a special capacity-in the field of space--there is room for new cooperation, for further joint efforts in the regulation and exploration of space. I include among these possibilities a joint expedition to the moon. Space offers no problems of sovereignty; by resolution of this Assembly, the members of the United Nations have foresworn any claim to territorial rights in outer space or on celestial bodies, and declared that international law and the United Nations Charter will apply. Why, therefore, should man's first flight to the moon be a matter of national competition? Why should the United States and the Soviet Union, in preparing for such expeditions, become involved in immense duplications of research, construction, and expenditure? Surely we should explore whether the scientists and astronauts of our two countries--indeed of all the world--cannot work together in the conquest of space, sending some day in this decade to the moon not the respresentatives of a single nation, but the representatives of all of our countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these and other new steps toward peaceful cooperation may be possible. Most of them will require on our part full consultation with our allies--for their interests are as much involved as our own, and we will not make an agreement at their expense. Most of them will require long and careful negotiation. And most of them will require a new approach to the cold war--a desire not to \\\"bury\\\" one's adversary, but to compete in a host of peaceful arenas, in ideas, in production, and ultimately in service to all mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contest will continue--the contest between those who see a monolithic world and those who believe in diversity--but it should be a contest in leadership and responsibility instead of destruction, a contest in achievement instead of intimidation. Speaking for the United States of America, I welcome such a contest. For we believe that truth is stronger than error--and that freedom is more enduring than coercion. And in the contest for a better life, all the world can be a winner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effort to improve the conditions of man, however, is not a task for the few. It is the task of all nations--acting alone, acting in groups, acting in the United Nations, for plague and pestilence, and plunder and pollution, the hazards of nature, and the hunger of children are the foes of every nation. The earth, the sea, and the air are the concern of every nation. And science, technology, and education can be the ally of every nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever before has man had such capacity to control his own environment, to end thirst and hunger, to conquer poverty and disease, to banish illiteracy and massive human misery. We have the power to make this the best generation of mankind in the history of the world--or to make it the last.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States since the close of the war has sent over $100 billion worth of assistance to nations seeking economic viability. And 2 years ago this week we formed a Peace Corps to help interested nations meet the demand for trained manpower. Other industrialized nations whose economies were rebuilt not so long ago with some help from us are now in turn recognizing their responsibility to the less developed nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe provision of development assistance by individual nations must go on. But the United Nations also must play a larger role in helping bring to all men the fruits of modern science and industry. A United Nations conference on this subject he;d earlier this year at Geneva opened new vistas for the developing countries. Next year a United Nations Conference on Trade will consider the needs of these nations for new markets. And more than four-fifths of the entire United Nations system can be found today mobilizing the weapons of science and technology for the United Nations' Decade of Development.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut more can be done.\\r\\n\\r\\n--A world center for health communications under the World Health Organization could warn of epidemics and the adverse effects of certain drugs as well as transmit the results of new experiments and new discoveries.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Regional research centers could advance our common medical knowledge and train new scientists and doctors for new nations.\\r\\n\\r\\n--A global system of satellites could provide communication and weather information for all corners of the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n--A worldwide program of conservation could protect the forest and wild game preserves now in danger of extinction for all time, improve the marine harvest of food from our oceans, and prevent the contamination of air and water by industrial as well as nuclear pollution.\\r\\n\\r\\n--And, finally, a worldwide program of farm productivity and food distribution, similar to our country's \\\"Food for Peace\\\" program, could now give every child the food he needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut man does not live by bread alone-and the members of this organization are committed by the Charter to promote and respect human rights. Those rights are not respected when a Buddhist priest is driven from his pagoda, when a synagogue is shut down, when a Protestant church cannot open a mission, when a Cardinal is forced into hiding, or when a crowded church service is bombed. The United States of America is opposed to discrimination and persecution on grounds of race and religion anywhere in the world, including our own Nation. We are working to right the wrongs of our own country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough legislation and administrative action, through moral and legal commitment, this Government has launched a determined effort to rid our Nation of discrimination which has existed far too longin education, in housing, in transportation, in employment, in the civil service, in recreation, and in places of public accommodation. And therefore, in this or any other forum, we do not hesitate to condemn racial or religious injustice, whether committed or permitted by friend or foe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know that some of you have experienced discrimination in this country. But I ask you to believe me when I tell you that this is not the wish of most Americans--that we share your regret and resentment--and that we intend to end such practices for all time to come, not only for our visitors, but for our own citizens as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope that not only our Nation but all other multiracial societies will meet these standards of fairness and justice. We are opposed to apartheid and all forms of human oppression. We do not advocate the rights of black Africans in order to drive out white Africans. Our concern is the right of all men to equal protection under the law--and since human rights are indivisible, this body cannot stand aside when those rights are abused and neglected by any member state.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew efforts are needed if this Assembly's Declaration of Human Rights, now 15 years old, is to have full meaning. And new means should be found for promoting the free expression and trade of ideas--through travel and communication, and through increased exchanges of people, and books, and broadcasts. For as the world renounces the competition of weapons, competition in ideas must flourish--and that competition must be as full and as fair as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States delegation will be prepared to suggest to the United Nations initiatives in the pursuit of all the goals. For this is an organization for peace--and peace cannot come without work and without progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peacekeeping record of the United Nations has been a proud one, though its tasks are always formidable. We are fortunate to have the skills of our distinguished Secretary General and the brave efforts of those who have been serving the cause of peace in the Congo, in the Middle East, in Korea and Kashmir, in West New Guinea and Malaysia. But what the United Nations has done in the past is less important than the tasks for the future. We cannot take its peacekeeping machinery for granted. That machinery must be soundly financed-which it cannot be if some members are allowed to prevent it from meeting its obligations by failing to meet their own. The United Nations must be supported by all those who exercise their franchise here. And its operations must be backed to the end.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo often a project is undertaken in the excitement of a crisis and then it begins to lose its appeal as the problems drag on and the bills pile up. But we must have the steadfastness to see every enterprise through.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is, for example, most important not to jeopardize the extraordinary United Nations gains in the Congo. The nation which sought this organization's help only 3 years ago has now asked the United Nations' presence to remain a little longer. I believe this Assembly should do what is necessary to preserve the gains already made and to protect the new nation in its struggle for progress. Let us complete what we have started. For \\\"No man who puts his hand to the plow and looks back,\\\" as the Scriptures tell us, \\\"No man who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the Kingdom of God.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI also hope that the recent initiative of several members in preparing standby peace forces for United Nations call will encourage similar commitments by others. This Nation remains ready to provide logistic and other material support.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicing, moreover, is not enough without provision for pacific settlement. We should increase the resort to special missions of factfinding and conciliation, make greater use of the International Court of Justice, and accelerate the work of the International Law Commission.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations cannot survive as a static organization. Its obligations are increasing as well as its size. Its Charter must be changed as well as its customs. The authors of that Charter did not intend that it be frozen in perpetuity. The science of weapons and war has made us all, far more than 18 years ago in San Francisco, one world and one human race, with one common destiny. In such a world, absolute -sovereignty no longer assures us of absolute security. The conventions of peace must pull abreast and then ahead of the inventions of war. The United Nations, building on its successes and learning from its failures, must be developed into a genuine world security system.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut peace does not rest in charters and covenants alone. It lies in the hearts and minds of all people. And if it is east out there, then no act, no pact, no treaty, no organization can hope to preserve it without the support and the wholehearted commitment of all people. So let us not rest all our hopes on parchment and on paper; let us strive to build peace, a desire for peace, a willingness to work for peace, in the hearts and minds of all of our people. I believe that we can. I believe the problems of human destiny are not beyond the reach of human beings.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years ago I told this body that the United States had proposed, and was willing to sign, a limited test ban treaty. Today that treaty has been signed. It will not put an end to war. It will not remove basic conflicts. It will not secure freedom for all. But it can be a lever, and Archimedes, in explaining the principles of the lever, was said to have declared to his friends: \\\"Give me a place where I can stand--and I shall move the world.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow inhabitants of this planet: Let us take our stand here in this Assembly of nations. And let us see if we, in our own time, can move the world to a just and lasting peace.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"September 20, 1963: Address to the UN General Assembly\"},{\"doc_name\":\"september-25-1961-address-un-general-assembly\",\"date\":\"1961-09-25\",\"transcript\":\"Mr. President, honored delegates, ladies and gentlemen:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe meet in an hour of grief and challenge. Dag Hammarskjold is dead. But the United Nations lives. His tragedy is deep in our hearts, but the task for which he died is at the top of our agenda. A noble servant of peace is gone. But the quest for peace lies before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem is not the death of one man--the problem is the life of this organization. It will either grow to meet the challenges of our age, or it will be gone with the wind, without influence, without force, without respect. Were we to let it die, to enfeeble its vigor, to cripple its powers, we would condemn our future.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor in the development of this organization rests the only true alternative to war--and war appeals no longer as a rational alternative. Unconditional war can no longer lead to unconditional victory. It can no longer serve to settle disputes. It can no longer concern the great powers alone. For a nuclear disaster, spread by wind and water and fear, could well engulf the great and the small, the rich and the poor, the committed and the uncommitted alike. Mankind must put an end to war--or war will put an end to mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo let us here resolve that Dag Hammarskjold did not live, or die, in vain. Let us call a truce to terror. Let us invoke the blessings of peace. And, as we build an international capacity to keep peace, let us join in dismantling the national capacity to wage war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will require new strength and new roles for the United Nations. For disarmament without checks is but a shadow-and a community without law is but a shell. Already the United Nations has become both the measure and the vehicle of man's most generous impulses. Already it has provided--in the Middle East, in Asia, in Africa this year in the Congo--a means of holding man's violence within bounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the great question which confronted this body in 1945 is still before us: whether man's cherished hopes for progress and peace are to be destroyed by terror and disruption, whether the \\\"foul winds of war\\\" can be tamed in time to free the cooling winds of reason, and whether the pledges of our Charter are to be fulfilled or defied-pledges to secure peace, progress, human rights and world law.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this Hall, there are not three forces, but two. One is composed of those who are trying to build the kind of world described in Articles I and II of the Charter. The other, seeking a far different world, would undermine this organization in the process.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday of all days our dedication to the Charter must be maintained. It must be strengthened first of all by the selection of an outstanding civil servant to carry forward the responsibilities of the Secretary General--a man endowed with both the wisdom and the power to make meaningful the moral force of the world community. The late Secretary General nurtured and sharpened the United Nations' obligation to act. But he did not invent it. It was there in the Charter. It is still there in the Charter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever difficult it may be to fill Mr. Hammarskjold's place, it can better be filled by one man rather than by three. Even the three horses of the Troika did not have three drivers, all going in different directions. They had only one--and so must the United Nations executive. To install a triumvirate, or any panel, or any rotating authority, in the United Nations administrative offices would replace order with anarchy, action with paralysis, confidence with confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secretary General, in a very real sense, is the servant of the General Assembly. Diminish his authority and you diminish the authority of the only body where all nations, regardless of power, are equal and sovereign. Until all the powerful are just, the weak will be secure only in the strength of this Assembly.\\r\\n\\r\\nEffective and independent executive action is not the same question as balanced representation. In view of the enormous change in membership in this body since its founding, the American delegation will join in any effort for the prompt review and revision of the composition of United Nations bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to give this organization three drivers-to permit each great power to decide its own case, would entrench the Cold War in the headquarters of peace. Whatever advantages such a plan may hold out to my own country, as one of the great powers, we reject it. For we far prefer world law, in the age of self-determination, to world war, in the age of mass extermination.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, every inhabitant of this planet must contemplate the day when this planet may no longer be habitable. Every man, woman and child lives under a nuclear sword of Damocles, hanging by the slenderest of threads, capable of being cut at any moment by accident or miscalculation or by madness. The weapons of war must be abolished before they abolish us.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen no longer debate whether armaments are a symptom or a cause of tension. The mere existence of modern weapons--ten million times more powerful than any that the world has ever seen, and only minutes away from any target on earth--is a source of horror, and discord and distrust. Men no longer maintain that disarmament must await the settlement of all disputes--for disarmament must be a part of any permanent settlement. And men may no longer pretend that the quest for disarmament is a sign of weakness--for in a spiraling arms race, a nation's security may well be shrinking even as its arms increase.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 15 years this organization has sought the reduction and destruction of arms. Now that goal is no longer a dream--it is a practical matter of life or death. The risks inherent in disarmament pale in comparison to the risks inherent in an unlimited arms race.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is in this spirit that the recent Belgrade Conference--recognizing that this is no longer a Soviet problem or an American problem, but a human problem--endorsed a program of \\\"general, complete and strictly an internationally controlled disarmament.\\\" It is in this same spirit that we in the United States have labored this year, with a new urgency, and with a new, now statutory agency fully endorsed by the Congress, to find an approach to disarmament which would be so far-reaching yet realistic, so mutually balanced and beneficial, that it could be accepted by every nation. And it is in this spirit that we have presented with the agreement of the Soviet Union--under the label both nations now accept of \\\"general and complete disarmament\\\"--a new statement of newly-agreed principles for negotiation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we are well aware that all issues of principle are not settled, and that principles alone are not enough. It is therefore our intention to challenge the Soviet Union, not to an arms race, but to a peace race--to advance together step by step, stage by stage, until general and complete disarmament has been achieved. We invite them now to go beyond agreement in principle to reach agreement on actual plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program to be presented to this assembly--for general and complete disarmament under effective international control-moves to bridge the gap between those who insist on a gradual approach and those who talk only of the final and total achievement. It would create machinery to keep the peace as it destroys the machinery Of war. It would proceed through balanced and safeguarded stages designed to give no state a military advantage over another. It would place the final responsibility for verification and control where it belongs, not with the big powers alone, not with one's adversary or one's self, but in an international organization within the framework of the United Nations. It would assure that indispensable condition of disarmament-true inspection--and apply it in stages proportionate to the stage of disarmament. It would cover delivery systems as well as weapons. It would ultimately halt their production as well as their testing, 'their transfer as well as their possession. It would achieve, under the eyes of an international disarmament organization, a steady reduction in force, both nuclear and conventional, until it has abolished all armies and all weapons except those needed for internal order and a new United Nations Peace Force. And it starts that process now, today, even as the talks begin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, general and complete disarmament must no longer be a slogan, used to resist the first steps. It is no longer to be a goal without means of achieving it, without means of verifying its progress, without means of keeping the peace. It is now a realistic plan, and a test--a test of those only willing to talk and a test of those willing to act.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a plan would not bring a world free from conflict and greed--but it would bring a world free from the terrors of mass destruction It would not usher in the era of the super state--but it would usher in an era in which no state could annihilate or be annihilated by another.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1945, this Nation proposed the Baruch Plan to internationalize the atom before other nations even possessed the bomb or demilitarized their troops. We proposed with our allies the Disarmament Plan of 1951 while still at war in Korea. And we make our proposals today, while building up our defenses over Berlin, not because we are inconsistent or insincere or intimidated, but because we know the rights of free men will prevail--because while we are compelled against our will to rearm, we look confidently beyond Berlin to the kind of disarmed world we all prefer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore propose, on the basis of this Plan, that disarmament negotiations resume promptly, and continue without interruption until an entire program for general and complete disarmament has not only been agreed but has been actually achieved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe logical place to begin is a treaty assuring the end of nuclear tests of all kinds, in every environment, under workable controls. The United States and the United Kingdom have proposed such a treaty that is both reasonable, effective and ready for signature. We are still prepared to sign that treaty today.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also proposed a mutual ban on atmospheric testing, without inspection or controls, in order to save the human race from the poison of radioactive fallout. We regret that that offer has not been accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 15 years we have sought to make the atom an instrument of peaceful growth rather than of war. But for 15 years our concessions have been matched by obstruction, our patience by intransigence. And the pleas of mankind for peace have met with disregard.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, as the explosions of others beclouded the skies, my country was left with no alternative but to act in the interests of its own and the free world's security. We cannot endanger that security by refraining from testing while others improve their arsenals. Nor can we endanger it by another long, un-inspected ban on testing. For three years we accepted those risks in our open society while seeking agreement on inspection. But this year, while we were negotiating in good faith in Geneva, others were secretly preparing new experiments in destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur tests are not polluting the atmosphere. Our deterrent weapons are guarded against accidental explosion or use. Our doctors and scientists stand ready to help any nation measure and meet the hazards to health which inevitably result from the tests in the atmosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to halt the spread of these terrible weapons, to halt the contamination of the air, to halt the spiraling nuclear arms race, we remain ready to seek new avenues of agreement, our new Disarmament Program thus includes the following proposals:\\r\\n\\r\\n--First, signing the test-ban treaty by all nations. This can be done now. Test ban negotiations need not and should not await general disarmament.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Second, stopping the production of fissionable materials for use in weapons, and preventing their transfer to any nation now lacking in nuclear weapons.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Third, prohibiting the transfer of control over nuclear weapons to states that do not own them.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Fourth, keeping nuclear weapons from seeding new battlegrounds in outer space.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Fifth, gradually destroying existing nuclear weapons and converting their materials to peaceful uses; and\\r\\n\\r\\n--Finally, halting the unlimited testing and production of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles, and gradually destroying them as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo destroy arms, however, is not enough. We must create even as we destroy--creating worldwide law and law enforcement as we outlaw worldwide war and weapons. In the world we seek, the United Nations Emergency Forces which have been hastily assembled, uncertainly supplied, and inadequately financed, will never be enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, the United States recommends the Presidents that all member nations earmark special peace-keeping units in their armed forces-to be on call of the United Nations, to be specially trained and quickly available, and with advance provision for financial and logistic support.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the American delegation will suggest a series of steps to improve the United Nations' machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes--for on-the-spot fact-finding, mediation and adjudication--for extending the rule of international law. For peace is not solely a matter of military or technical problems--it is primarily a problem of politics and people. And unless man can match his strides in weaponry and technology with equal strides in social and political development, our great strength, like that of the dinosaur, will become incapable of proper control--and like the dinosaur vanish from the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we extend the rule of law on earth, so must we also extend it to man's new domain--outer space.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of us salute the brave cosmonauts of the Soviet Union. The new horizons of outer space must not be driven by the old bitter concepts of imperialism and sovereign claims. The cold reaches of the universe must not become the new arena of an even colder war.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this end, we shall urge proposals extending the United Nations Charter to the limits of man's exploration in the universe, reserving outer space for peaceful use, prohibiting weapons of mass destruction in space or on celestial bodies, and opening the mysteries and benefits of space to every nation. We shall propose further cooperative efforts between all nations in weather prediction and eventually in weather control. We shall propose, finally, a global system of communications satellites linking the whole world in telegraph and telephone and radio and television. The day need not be fat away when such a system will televise the proceedings of this body to every corner of the world for the benefit of peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the mysteries of outer space must not divert our eyes or our energies from the harsh realities that face our fellow men. Political sovereignty is but a mockery without the means of meeting poverty and literacy and disease. Self-determination is but a slogan if the future holds no hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is why my Nation, which has freely shared its capital and its technology to help others help themselves, now proposes officially designating this decade of the 1960's as the United Nations Decade of Development. Under the framework of that Resolution, the United Nations' existing efforts in promoting economic growth can be expanded and coordinated. Regional surveys and training institutes can now pool the talents of many. New research, technical assistance and pilot projects can unlock the wealth of less developed lands and untapped waters. And development can become a cooperative and not a competitive enterprise-to enable all nations, however diverse in their systems and beliefs, to become in fact as well as in law free and equal nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Country favors a world of free and equal states. We agree with those who say that colonialism is a key issue in this Assembly But let the full facts of that issue be discussed in full.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the one hand is the fact that, since the close of World War II, a worldwide declaration of independence has transformed nearly 1 billion people and 9 million square miles into 42 free and independent states. Less than 2 percent of the world's population now lives in \\\"dependent\\\" territories.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not ignore the remaining problems of traditional colonialism which still confront this body. Those problems will be solved, with patience, good will, and determination. Within the limits of our responsibility in such matters, my Country intends to be a participant and not merely an observer, in the peaceful, expeditious movement of nations from the status of colonies to the partnership of equals. That continuing tide of self-determination, which runs so strong, has our sympathy and our support.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut colonialism in its harshest forms is not only the exploitation of new nations by old, of dark skins by light, or the subjugation of the poor by the rich. My Nation was once a colony, and we know what colonialism means; the exploitation and subjugation of the weak by the powerful, of the many by the few, of the governed who have given no consent to be governed, whatever their continent, their class, or their color.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that is why there is no ignoring the fact that the tide of self-determination has not reached the Communist empire where a population far larger than that officially termed \\\"dependent\\\" lives under governments installed by foreign troops instead of free institutions--under a system which knows only one party and one belief--which suppresses free debate, and free elections, and free newspapers, and free books and free trade unions--and which builds a wall to keep truth a stranger and its own citizens prisoners. Let us debate colonialism in full--and apply the principle of free choice and the practice of free plebiscites in every corner of the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, as President of the United States, I consider it my duty to report to this Assembly on two threats to the peace which are not on your crowded agenda, but which causes us, and most of you, the deepest concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first threat on which I wish to report is widely misunderstood: the smoldering coals of war in Southeast Asia. South Viet-Nam is already under attack--sometimes by a single assassin, sometimes by a band of guerrillas, recently by full battalions. The peaceful borders of Burma, Cambodia, and India have been repeatedly violated. And the peaceful people of Laos are in danger of losing the independence they gained not so long ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one can call these \\\"wars of liberation.\\\" For these are free countries living under their own governments. Nor are these aggressions any less real because men are knifed in their homes and not shot in the fields of battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very simple question confronting the world community is whether measures can be devised to protect the small and the weak from such tactics. For if they are successful in Laos and South Viet-Nam, the gates will be opened wide.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States seeks for itself no base, no territory, no special position in this area of any kind. We support a truly neutral and independent Laos, its people free from outside interference, living at peace with themselves and with their neighbors, assured that their territory will not be used for attacks on others, and under a government comparable (as Mr. Khrushchev and I agreed at Vienna) to Cambodia and Burma.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now the negotiations over Laos are reaching a crucial stage. The cease-fire is at best precarious. The rainy season is coming to an end. Laotian territory is being used to infiltrate South Viet-Nam. The world community must recognize--and all those who are involved--that this potent threat to Laotian peace and freedom is indivisible from all other threats to their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, I wish to report to you on the crisis over Germany and Berlin. This is not the time or the place for immoderate tones, but the world community is entitled to know the very simple issues as we see them. If there is a crisis' it is because an existing peace is under threat, because an existing island of free people is under pressure, because solemn agreements are being treated with indifference. Established international rights are being threatened with unilateral usurpation. Peaceful circulation has been interrupted by barbed wire and concrete blocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne recalls the order of the Czar in Pushkin's \\\"Boris Godunov\\\": \\\"Take steps at this very hour that our frontiers be fenced in by barriers .... That not a single soul pass o'er the border, that not a hare be able to run or a crow to fly.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is absurd to allege that we are threatening a war merely to prevent the Soviet Union and East Germany from signing a so-called \\\"treaty\\\" of peace. The Western Allies are not concerned with any paper arrangement the Soviets may wish to make with a regime of their own creation, on territory occupied by their own troops and governed by their own agents. No such action can affect either our rights or our responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there is a dangerous crisis in Berlin-and there is--it is because of threats against the vital interests and the deep commitments of the Western Powers, and the freedom of West Berlin. We cannot yield these interests. We cannot fail these commitments. We cannot surrender the freedom of these people for whom we are responsible. A \\\"peace treaty\\\" which carried with it the provisions which destroy the peace would be a fraud. A \\\"free city\\\" which was not genuinely free would suffocate freedom and would be an infamy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a city or a people to be truly free, they must have the secure right, without economic, political or police pressure, to make their own choice and to live their own lives. And as I have said before, if anyone doubts the extent to which our presence is desired by the people of West Berlin, we are ready to have that question submitted to a free vote in all Berlin and, if possible, among all the German people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elementary fact about this crisis is that it is unnecessary. The elementary tools for a peaceful settlement are to be found in the charter. Under its law, agreements are to be kept, unless changed by all those who made them. Established rights are to be respected. The political disposition of peoples should rest upon their own wishes, freely expressed in plebiscites or free elections. If there are legal problems, they can be solved by legal means. If there is a threat of force, it must be rejected. If there is desire for change, it must be a subject for negotiation and if there is negotiation, it must be rooted in mutual respect and concern for the rights of others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Western Powers have calmly resolved to defend, by whatever means are forced upon them, their obligations and their access to the free citizens of West Berlin and the self-determination of those citizens. This generation learned from bitter experience that either brandishing or yielding to threats can only lead to war. But firmness and reason can lead to the kind of peaceful solution in which my country profoundly believes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are committed to no rigid formula. We see no perfect solution. We recognize that troops and tanks can, for a time, keep a nation divided against its will, however unwise that policy may seem to us. But we believe a peaceful agreement is possible which protects the freedom of West Berlin and allied presence and access, while recognizing the historic and legitimate interests of others in assuring European security.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possibilities of negotiation are now being explored; it is too early to report what the prospects may be. For our part, we would be glad to report at the appropriate time that a solution has been found. For there is no need for a crisis over Berlin, threatening the peace--and if those who created this crisis desire peace, there will be peace and freedom in Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe events and decisions of the next ten months may well decide the fate of man for the next ten thousand years. There will be no avoiding those events. There will be no appeal from these decisions. And we in this hall shall be remembered either as part of the generation that turned this planet into a flaming funeral pyre or the generation that met its vow \\\"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the endeavor to meet that vow, I pledge you every effort this Nation possesses. I pledge you that we shall neither commit nor provoke aggression, that we shall neither flee nor invoke the threat of force, that we shall never negotiate out of fear, we shall never fear to negotiate.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerror is not a new weapon. Throughout history it has been used by those who could not prevail, either by persuasion or example. But inevitably they fail, either because men are not afraid to die for a life worth living, or because the terrorists themselves came to realize that free men cannot be frightened by threats, and that aggression would meet its own response. And it is in the light of that history that every nation today should know, be he friend or foe, that the United States has both the will and the weapons to join free men in standing up to their responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I come here today to look across this world of threats to a world of peace. In that search we cannot expect any final triumph-for new problems will always arise. We cannot expect that all nations will adopt like systems--for conformity is the jailer of freedom, and the enemy of growth. Nor can we expect to reach our goal by contrivance, by fiat or even by the wishes of all. But however close we sometimes seem to that dark and final abyss, let no man of peace and freedom despair. For he does not stand alone. If we all can persevere, if we can in every land and office look beyond our own shores and ambitions, then surely the age will dawn in which the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nLadies and gentlemen of this Assembly, the decision is ours. Never have the nations of the world had so much to lose, or so much to gain. Together we shall save our planet, or together we shall perish in its flames. Save it we can--and save it we must--and then shall we earn the eternal thanks of mankind and, as peacemakers, the eternal blessing of God. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F.

SMITH, MODERATOR: Good evening. The television and radio stations of the United States and their affiliated stations are proud to provide facilities for a discussion of issues in the current political campaign by the two major candidates for the presidency. The candidates need no introduction. The Republican candidate, Vice President Richard M. Nixon, and the Democratic candidate, Senator John F. Kennedy. According to rules set by the candidates themselves, each man shall make an opening statement of approximately eight minutes' duration and a closing statement of approximately three minutes' duration. In between the candidates will answer, or comment upon answers to questions put by a panel of correspondents. In this, the first discussion in a series of four uh - joint appearances, the subject-matter has been agreed, will be restricted to internal or domestic American matters. And now for the first opening statement by Senator John F. Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSENATOR KENNEDY: Mr. Smith, Mr. Nixon. In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free. In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain. We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival. Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself. The Chinese Communists have always had a large population. But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country. The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom. If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world. If we fail, then freedom fails. Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do? Are we as strong as we should be? Are we as strong as we must be if we're going to maintain our independence, and if we're going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival? I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making. This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country. I'm not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused. I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we're able to sustain our defenses; it means we're able to meet our commitments abroad. I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual. I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don't think we're meeting our obligations toward these Americans. I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts. I think we should have an educational system second to none. I'm not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa - in charge of the largest union in the United States - still free. I'm not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest. Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production - and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society - the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are. These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still. I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights. If a Negro baby is born - and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities - he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby. He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student. He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house. He has about uh - four times as much chance that he'll be out of work in his life as the white baby. I think we can do better. I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste. I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government. I don't at all. I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities. And I want the states to meet their responsibilities. But I think there is also a national responsibility. The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years. The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have. A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so. Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system. I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action. And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom. It's the only way that we're going to move ahead. I think we can do a better job. I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us. We cannot turn the job over to anyone else. If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails. And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. Because they felt that the American society was moving again. I want us to recapture that image. I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists. That is the obligation upon our generation. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny. I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous. The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known? I think it can be. And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here. I think it's time America started moving again.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: And now the opening statement by Vice President Richard M. Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Mr. Smith, Senator Kennedy. The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. We're ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G.N.P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that it's six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let's look at the record. Is the United States standing still? Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation? Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead. Well, we have a comparison that we can make. We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration. When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has - has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead. Let's take schools. We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years. Let's take hydroelectric power. We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history. Let us take hospitals. We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration. The same is true of highways. Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand. We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years. That shows that there's been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor. But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family. What has happened to you? We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration. What about the prices you pay? We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration. What's the net result of this? This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years. Now, this is not standing still. But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough. A record is never something to stand on. It's something to build on. And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress. And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way. Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way. I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion. But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new. They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it. And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then. What kind of programs are we for? We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people. We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are - is - are much - is much better handled than it is at the present time. Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims. We both want to help the old people. We want to see that they do have adequate medical care. The question is the means. I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates. I could give better examples, but for - for whatever it is, whether it's in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years. Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you're spending. I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend. I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform. It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we're presently spending. Now the Republican platform will cost more too. It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending. Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours? Not at all. Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most. It is a question of which administration does the right thing. And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans. I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress. The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate. Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere. I know what it means to be poor. I know what it means to see people who are unemployed. I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Nixon. That completes the opening statements, and now the candidates will answer questions or comment upon one another's answers to questions, put by correspondents of the networks. The correspondents: [introducing themselves: \\\"I'm Sander Vanocur, NBC News;\\\" \\\"I'm Charles Warren, Mutual News;\\\" \\\"I'm Stuart Novins, CBS News;\\\" \\\"Bob Fleming, ABC News.\\\"] The first question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Fleming.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. FLEMING: Senator, the Vice President in his campaign has said that you were naive and at times immature. He has raised the question of leadership. On this issue, why do you think people should vote for you rather than the Vice President?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee. I've been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh - government is comparable. Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead? I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I've discussed tonight. Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party. He was nominated by it. And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources. I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party. I hope he would grant me the same. The question before us is: which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Nixon, would you like to comment on that statement?\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. NIXON: I have no comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. SMITH: The next question: Mr. Novins.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NOVINS: Mr. Vice President, your campaign stresses the value of your eight year experience, and the question arises as to whether that experience was as an observer or as a participant or as an initiator of policy-making. Would you tell us please specifically what major proposals you have made in the last eight years that have been adopted by the Administration?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes. I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned. First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted. For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field. After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same. Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress. Within the Administration, as a chairman of the President's Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective. I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective. I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it - I would not presume to - that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration. You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years. I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth. In regard to uh - price stability uh - I'm not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices. In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had. I think it's true of Latin America also. We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Warren.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WARREN: Uh - Senator Kennedy, during your brief speech a few minutes ago you mentioned farm surpluses.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: That's correct.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WARREN: I'd like to ask this: It's a fact, I think, that presidential candidates traditionally make promises to farmers. Lots of people, I think, don't understand why the government pays farmers for not producing certain crops or paying farmers if they overproduce for that matter. Now, let me ask, sir, why can't the farmer operate like the business man who operates a factory? If an auto company overproduces a certain model car Uncle Sam doesn't step in and buy up the surplus. Why this constant courting of the farmer?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos. The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well. They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place. I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture. And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse. The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States. The automobile industry is the number one market for steel. So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one. Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth. We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. I think that this farm policy has failed. In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. And that can only be done through governmental action. I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance - attempt effective production controls - so that we won't have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. I think Mr. Benson's program has failed. And I must say, after reading the Vice President's speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don't believe that it's very much different from Mr. Benson's. I don't think it provides effective governmental controls. I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson's theory. I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Nixon, comment?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON; I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program. He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh - that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh - controls on acreage even far more than they have today. I think this is the wrong direction. I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future. The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect. It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it. And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time. The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war. Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses. Until we get the surpluses off the farmer's back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up. But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. SMITH: The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr. Vanocur.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. VANOCUR: Uh - Mr. Vice President, since the question of executive leadership is a very important campaign issue, I'd like to follow Mr. Novins' question. Now, Republican campaign slogans - you'll see them on signs around the country as you did last week - say it's experience that counts - that's over a picture of yourself; sir uh - implying that you've had more governmental executive decision-making uh - experience than uh - your opponent. Now, in his news conference on August twenty-fourth, President Eisenhower was asked to give one example of a major idea of yours that he adopted. His reply was, and I'm quoting; \\\"If you give me a week I might think of one. I don't remember.\\\" Now that was a month ago, sir, and the President hasn't brought it up since, and I'm wondering, sir, if you can clarify which version is correct - the one put out by Republican campaign leaders or the one put out by President Eisenhower?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark. Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected. The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress. Now, I can only say this. Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council. I have been in the cabinet. I have met with the legislative leaders. I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters. The President has asked for my advice. I have given it. Sometimes my advice has been taken. Sometimes it has not. I do not say that I have made the decisions. And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions. All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it. As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say. Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider. As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year. His experience has been different from mine. Mine has been in the executive branch. His has been in the legislative branch. I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. KENNEDY: Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals. Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh - session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president. There's no certain road to the presidency. There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president. I have been in the Congress for fourteen years. I have voted in the last uh - eight years uh - and the Vice President was uh - presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities. I have met met uh - decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Novins.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NOVINS: Senator Kennedy, in connection with these problems of the future that you speak of, and the program that you enunciated earlier in your direct talk, you call for expanding some of the welfare programs for schools, for teacher salaries, medical care, and so forth; but you also call for reducing the federal debt. And I'm wondering how you, if you're president in January, would go about paying the bill for all this. Does this mean that you?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: I didn't indicate. I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I don't believe that you're going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty-one, two, or three. I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet. And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NOVINS: Senator, I believe in - in one of your speeches -\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: No, never.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NOVINS: - you suggested that reducing the interest rate would help toward -\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: No. No. Not reducing the interest -\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NOVINS: - a reduction of the Federal debt.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: - reducing the interest rate. In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960. What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound. Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security. The Vice President and I disagree on this. The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state. The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax. Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries. I think that's a good investment. I think we're going to have to do it. And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated. There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none. On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley. I believe in the balanced budget. And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession. Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues. Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Nixon, your comment?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Yes. I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy's speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt. I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes. As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes. As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security. That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security. He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development. Where our natural resources development - which I also support, incidentally, however - whenever you uh - uh - in - in - uh - appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn't mean that you - the government doesn't have to put out the money this year. And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget. If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we've been talking about. As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries. I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr. Warren.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WARREN: Mr. Vice President you mentioned schools and it was just yesterday I think you asked for a crash program to raise education standards, and this evening you talked about advances in education. Mr. Vice President, you said - it was back in 1957 - that salaries paid to school teachers were nothing short of a national disgrace. Higher salaries for teachers, you added, were important and if the situation wasn't corrected it could lead to a national disaster. And yet, you refused to vote in the Senate in order to break a tie vote when that single vote, if it had been yes, would have granted salary increases to teachers. I wonder if you could explain that, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument. Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries. We need higher teachers' salaries. But we also want our education to be free of federal control. When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession. There is another point that should be made. I favor higher salaries for teachers. But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers' salaries. I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers' salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should. I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility. Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries. This is not enough; it should be more. But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program. My objection here is not the cost in dollars. My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Senator Kennedy's comment?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers' salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February. The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state. The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries. On that question the Vice President and I disagreed. I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal. I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly. But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee. And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass. Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget. That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars. That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record. My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Vanocur.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. VANOCUR: Senator, you've been promising the voters that if you are elected president you'll try and push through Congress bills on medical aid to the aged, a comprehensive minimum hourly wage bill, federal aid to education. Now, in the August post-convention session of the Congress, when you at least held up the possibility you could one day be president and when you had overwhelming majorities, especially in the Senate, you could not get action on these bills. Now how do you feel that you'll be able to get them in January -\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well as you take the bills -\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. VANOCUR: - if you weren't able to get them in August?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh - to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage. It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes. And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five. We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter - it's extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it. All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate. Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate. It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives. It was killed in the Rules Committee. And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House. Four Democrats voted for it. Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives. Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that's been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security. We wanted to tie it to Social Security. We offered an amendment to do so. Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it. And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it. In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs. But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Nixon, comment?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Well obviously my views are a little different. First of all, I don't see how it's possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led. I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans. It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee. I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark. When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress. Because let's consider it. If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue? The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them. It was because they were too extreme. And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: The next question to Vice President Nixon fa- from Mr. Fleming.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. FLEMING: Mr. Vice President, do I take it then you believe that you can work better with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate than Senator Kennedy could work with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON; I would say this: that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate. Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election. We cannot, of course, control the Senate. I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people. Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing. It isn't really that. Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it. And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress. Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs. You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him. And the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, now let's look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme. One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business. I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal. Secondly was the federal aid to education bill. It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need. The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal. It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it. I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program. But I do say a majority are. And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it. The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds. It does not put a deficit on the Treasury. The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security. So these are three programs which are quite moderate. I think it shows the difference between the two parties. One party is ready to move in these programs. The other party gives them lip service.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Warren's question for Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. WARREN: Senator Kennedy, on another subject, Communism is so often described as an ideology or a belief that exists somewhere other than in the United States. Let me ask you, sir: just how serious a threat to our national security are these Communist subversive activities in the United States today?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, I think they're serious. I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to. We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within. We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert. I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat. The major threat is external and will continue.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Nixon, comment?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect. The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past. It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come. We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it's waged right here in the United States. That's why we have to continue to be alert. It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy. We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow. And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon. And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his. The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Vanocur's question for Vice President Nixon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. VANOCUR: Mr. Vice President uh - in one of your earlier statements you said we've moved ahead, we've built more schools, we've built more hospitals. Now, sir, isn't it true that the building of more schools is a local matter for financing? Uh - Were you claiming that the Eisenhower Administration was responsible for the building of these schools, or is it the local school districts that provide for it?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Not at all. As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make. Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing. Now that isn't the test of whether America moves. The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all - individual enterprise - moves. We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars. Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity. Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do. Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we've had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period. And that is growth. That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Senator Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools. Secondly, I think we have a rich uh - country. And I think we have a powerful country. I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources. The Soviet Union is making great gains. It isn't enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago. I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength. I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Can I have the summation time please? We've completed our questions and our comments, and in just a moment, we'll have the summation time.\\r\\n\\r\\nVOICE: This will allow three minutes and twenty seconds for the summation by each candidate.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SM1TH: Three minutes and twenty seconds for each candidate. Vice President Nixon, will you make the first summation?\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. NIXON: Thank you, Mr. Smith. Senator Kennedy. First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth. The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have. But the reason for that is obvious. They start from a much lower base. Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product. That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago. And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago. Is this any reason for complacency? Not at all Because these are determined men. They are fanatical men. And we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy. I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score. Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy. I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth. I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated. There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon. The one in the field of health is worth mentioning. Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it. It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance. But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it. His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not. And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all. Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his. The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation. We found the people who could least afford it - people on retired incomes uh - people on fixed incomes - we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month. It is essential that a man who's president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth. And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress. But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Senator Kennedy, your conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. KENNEDY: The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours. I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight. I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship. I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction. Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged. Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill. The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security. I think it's a very clear contrast. In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it. Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it. In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion. Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans. The means are at question. The means are at issue. If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we've b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree. I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon. But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people - what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom. As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful? That's the great issue. And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer. If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us. And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States. I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again. That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future. I think we're ready to move. And it is to that great task, if we're successful, that we will address ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nMR. SMITH: Thank you very much, gentlemen. This hour has gone by all too quickly. Thank you very much for permitting us to present the next president of the United States on this unique program. I've been asked by the candidates to thank the American networks and the affiliated stations for providing time and facilities for this joint appearance. Other debates in this series will be announced later and will be on different subjects. This is Howard K. Smith. Good night from Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"September 26, 1960: Debate with Richard Nixon in Chicago\"},{\"doc_name\":\"september-26-1963-address-mormon-tabernacle\",\"date\":\"1963-09-26\",\"transcript\":\"Senator Moss, my old colleague in the United States Senate, your distinguished Senator Moss, President McKay, Mr. Brown, Secretary Udall, Governor, Mr. Rawlings, ladies and gentlemen:\\r\\nI appreciate your welcome, and I am very proud to be back in this historic building and have an opportunity to say a few words on some matters which concern me as President, and I hope concern you as citizens. The fact is, I take strength and hope in seeing this monument, hearing its story retold by Ted Moss, and recalling how this State was built, and what it started with, and what it has now.\\r\\nOf all the stories of American pioneers and settlers, none is more inspiring than the Mormon trail. The qualities of the founders of this community are the qualities that we seek in America, the qualities which we like to feel this country has, courage, patience, faith, self-reliance, perseverance, and, above all, an unflagging determination to see the right prevail.\\r\\nI came on this trip to see the United States, and I can assure you that there is nothing more encouraging for any of us who work in Washington than to have a chance to fly across this United States, and drive through it, and see what a great country it is, and come to understand somewhat better how this country has been able for so many years to carry so many burdens in so many parts of the world.\\r\\nThe primary reason for my trip was conservation, and I include in conservation first our human resources and then our natural resources, and I think this State can take perhaps its greatest pride and its greatest satisfaction for what it has done, not in the field of the conservation and the development of natural resources, but what you have done to educate your children. This State has a higher percentage per capita of population of its boys and girls who finish high school and then go to college.\\r\\nOf all the waste in the United States in the 1960's, none is worse than to have 8 or 9 million boys and girls who will drop out, statistics tell us, drop out of school before they have finished, come into the labor market unprepared at the very time when machines are taking the place of men and women—9 million of them. We have a large minority of our population who have not even finished the sixth grade, and here in this richest of all countries, the country which spreads the doctrine of freedom and hope around the globe, we permit our most valuable resource, our young people, their talents to be wasted by leaving their schools.\\r\\nSo I think we have to save them. I think we have to insist that our children be educated to the limit of their talents, not just in your State, or in Massachusetts, but all over the United States. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, who developed the Northwest Ordinance, which put so much emphasis on education—Thomas Jefferson once said that any nation which expected to be ignorant and free, hopes for what never was and never will be. So I hope we can conserve this resource.\\r\\nThe other is the natural resource of our country, particularly the land west of the 100th parallel, where the rain comes 15 or 20 inches a year. This State knows that the control of water is the secret of the development of the West, and whether we use it for power, or for irrigation, or for whatever purpose, no drop of water west of the 100th parallel should flow to the ocean without being used. And to do that requires the dedicated commitment of the people of the States of the West, working with the people of all the United States who have such an important equity in the richness of this part of the country. So that we must do also.\\r\\nAs Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot did it in years past, we must do it in the 1960's and 1970's. We will triple the population of this country in the short space of 60 or 70 years, and we want those who come after us to have the same rich inheritance that we find now in the United States. This is the reason for the trip, but it is not what I wanted to speak about tonight.\\r\\nI want to speak about the responsibility that I feel the United States has not in this country, but abroad, and I see the closest interrelationship between the strength of the United States here at home and the strength of the United States around the world. There is one great natural development here in the United States which has had in its own way a greater effect upon the position and influence and prestige of the United States, almost, than any other act we have done. Do you know what it is? It is the Tennessee Valley. Nearly every leader of every new emerging country that comes to the United States wants to go to New York, to Washington, and the Tennessee Valley, because they want to see what we were able to do with the most poverty-ridden section of the United States in the short space of 30 years, by the wise management of our resources.\\r\\nWhat happens here in this country affects the security of the United States and the cause of freedom around the globe. If this is a strong, vital, and vigorous society, the cause of freedom will be strong and vital and vigorous.\\r\\nI know that many of you in this State and other States sometimes wonder where we are going and why the United States should be so involved in so many affairs, in so many countries all around the globe. If our task on occasion seems hopeless, if we despair of ever working our will on the other 94 percent of the world population, then let us remember that the Mormons of a century ago were a persecuted and prosecuted minority, harried from place to place, the victims of violence and occasionally murder, while today, in the short space of 100 years, their faith and works are known and respected the world around, and their voices heard in the highest councils of this country.\\r\\nAs the Mormons succeeded, so America can succeed, if we will not give up or turn back. I realize that the burdens are heavy and I realize that there is a great temptation to urge that we relinquish them, that we have enough to do here in the United States, and we should not be so busy around the globe. The fact of the matter is that we, this generation of Americans, are the first generation of our country ever to be involved in affairs around the globe. From the ginning of this country, from the days of Washington, until the Second World War, this country lived an isolated existence. Through most of our history we were an unaligned country, an uncommitted nation, a neutralist nation. We were by statute as well as by desire. We had believed that we could live behind our two oceans in safety and prosperity in a comfortable distance from the rest of the world.\\r\\nThe end of isolation consequently meant a wrench with the very lifeblood, the very spine, of the Nation. Yet, as time passed, we came to see that the end of isolation was not such a terrible error or evil after all. We came to see that it was the inevitable result of growth, the economic growth, the military growth, and the cultural growth of the United States. No nation so powerful and so dynamic and as rich as our own could hope to live in isolation from other nations, especially at a time when science and technology was making the world so small.\\r\\nIt took Brigham Young and his followers 108 days to go from Winter Quarters, Nebraska, to the valley of the Great Salt Lake. It takes 30 minutes for a missile to go from one continent to another. We did not seek to become a world power. This position was thrust upon us by events. But we became one just the same, and I am proud that we did.\\r\\nI can well understand the attraction of those earlier days. Each one of us has moments of longing for the past, but two world wars have clearly shown us, try as we may, that we cannot turn our back on the world outside. If we do, we jeopardize our economic well-being, we jeopardize our political stability, we jeopardize our physical safety.\\r\\nTo turn away now is to abandon the world to those whose ambition is to destroy a free society. To yield these burdens up after having carried them for more than 20 years is to surrender the freedom of our country inevitably, for without the United States, the chances of freedom surviving, let alone prevailing around the globe, are nonexistent.\\r\\nAmericans have come a long way in accepting in a short time the necessity of world involvement, but the strain of this involvement remains and we find it all over the country. I see it in the letters that come to my desk every day. We find ourselves entangled with apparently unanswerable problems in unpronounceable places. We discover that our enemy in one decade is our ally the next. We find ourselves committed to governments whose actions we cannot often approve, assisting societies with principles very different from our own.\\r\\nThe burdens of maintaining an immense military establishment with one million Americans serving outside our frontiers, of financing a far-flung program of development assistance, of conducting a complex and baffling diplomacy, all weigh heavily upon us and cause some to counsel retreat.\\r\\nThe world is full of contradiction and confusion, and our policy seems to have lost the black and white clarity of simpler times when we remembered the Maine and went to War.\\r\\nIt is little wonder, then, in this confusion, we look back to the old days with nostalgia. It is little wonder that there is a desire in the country to go back to the time when our Nation lived alone. It is little wonder that we increasingly want an end to entangling alliances, an end to all help to foreign countries, a cessation of diplomatic relations with countries or states whose principles we dislike, that we get the United Nations out of the United States, and the United States out of the United Nations, and that we retreat to our own hemisphere, or even within our own boundaries, to take refuge behind a wall of force.\\r\\nThis is an understandable effort to recover an old feeling of simplicity, yet in world affairs, as in all other aspects of our lives, the days of the quiet past are gone forever. Science and technology are irreversible. We cannot return to the day of the sailing schooner or the covered wagon, even if we wished. And if this Nation is to survive and succeed in the real world of today, we must acknowledge the realities of the world; and it is those realities that I mention now.\\r\\nWe must first of all recognize that we cannot remake the world simply by our own command. When we cannot even bring all of our own people into full citizenship without acts of violence, we can understand how much harder it is to control events beyond our borders.\\r\\nEvery nation has its own traditions, its own values, its own aspirations. Our assistance from time to time can help other nations preserve their independence and advance their growth, but we cannot remake them in our own image. We cannot enact their laws, nor can we operate their governments or dictate our policies.\\r\\nSecond, we must recognize that every tion determines its policies in terms of its own interests. \\\"No nation,\\\" George Washington wrote, \\\"is to be trusted farther than it is bound by its interest; and no prudent statesman or politician will depart from it.\\\" National interest is more powerful than ideology, and the recent developments within the Communist empire show this very clearly. Friendship, as Palmerston said, may rise or wane, but interests endure.\\r\\nThe United States has rightly determined, in the years since 1945 under three different administrations, that our interest, our national security, the interest of the United States of America, is best served by preserving and protecting a world of diversity in which no one power or no one combination of powers can threaten the security of the United States. The reason that we moved so far into the world was our fear that at the end of the war, and particularly when China became Communist, that Japan and Germany would collapse, and these two countries which had so long served as a barrier to the Soviet advance, and the Russian advance before that, would open up a wave of conquest of all of Europe and all of Asia, and then the balance of power turning against us we would finally be isolated and ultimately destroyed. That is what we have been engaged in for 18 years, to prevent that happening, to prevent any one monolithic power having sufficient force to destroy the United States.\\r\\nFor that reason we support the alliances in Latin America; for that reason we support NATO to protect the security of Western Europe; for that reason we joined SEATO to protect the security of Asia—so that neither Russia nor China could control Europe and Asia, and if they could not control Europe and Asia, then our security was assured. This is what we have been involved in doing. And however dangerous and hazardous it may be, and however close it may take us to the brink on occasion, which it has, and however tired we may get of our involvements with these governments so far away, we have one simple central theme of American foreign policy which all of us must recognize, because it is a policy which we must continue to follow, and that is to support the independence of nations so that one bloc cannot gain sufficient power to finally overcome us. There is no mistaking the vital interest of the United States in what goes on around the world. Therefore, accepting what George Washington said here, I realize that what George Washington said about no intangling alliances has been ended by science and technology and danger.\\r\\nAnd third, we must recognize that foreign policy in the modern world does not lend itself to easy, simple black and white solution. If we were to have diplomatic relations only with those countries whose principles we approved of, we would have relations with very few countries in a very short time. If we were to withdraw our assistance from all governments who are run differently from our own, we would relinquish half the world immediately to our adversaries. If we were to treat foreign policy as merely a medium for delivering self-righteous sermons to supposedly inferior people, we would give up all thought of world influence or world leadership.\\r\\nFor the purpose of foreign policy is not to provide an outlet for our own sentiments of hope or indignation; it is to shape real events in a real world. We cannot adopt a policy which says that if something does not happen, or others do not do exactly what we wish, we will return to \\\"Fortress America.\\\" That is the policy in this changing world of retreat, not of strength.\\r\\nMore important, to adopt a black or white, all or nothing policy subordinates our interest to our irritations. Its actual consequences would be fatal to our security. If we were to resign from the United Nations, break off with all countries of whom we disapprove, end foreign aid and assistance to those countries in an attempt to keep them free, call for the resumption of atmospheric nuclear testing, and turn our back on the rest of mankind, we would not only be abandoning America's influence in the world, we would be inviting a Communist expansion which every Communist power would so greatly welcome. And all of the effort of so many Americans for 18 years would be gone with the wind. Our policy under those conditions, in this dangerous world, would not have much deterrent effect in a world where nations determined to be free could no longer count on the United States.\\r\\nSuch a policy of retreat would be folly if we had our backs to the wall. It is surely even greater folly at a time when more realistic, more responsible, more affirmative policies have wrought such spectacular resuits. For the most striking thing about our world in 1963 is the extent to which the tide of history has begun to flow in the direction of freedom. To renounce the world of freedom now, to abandon those who share our commitment, and retire into lonely and not so splendid isolation, would be to give communism the one hope which, in this twilight of disappointment for them, might repair their divisions and rekindle their hope.\\r\\nFor after some gains in the fifties the Communist offensive, which claimed to be riding the tide of historic inevitability, has been thwarted and turned back in recent months. Indeed, the whole theory of historical inevitability, the belief that all roads must lead to communism, sooner or later, has been shattered by the determination of those who believe that men and nations will pursue a variety of roads, that each nation will evolve according to its own traditions and its own aspirations, and that the world of the future will have room for a diversity of economic systems, political creeds, religious faiths, united by the respect for others, and loyalty to a world order.\\r\\nThose forces of diversity which served Mr. Washington's national interest—those forces of diversity are in the ascendancy today, even within the Communist empire itself. And our policy at this point should be to give the forces of diversity, as opposed to the forces of uniformity, which our adversaries espouse, every chance, every possible support. That is why our assistance program, so much maligned, of assisting countries to maintain their freedom, I believe, is important.\\r\\nThis country has seen all of the hardship and the grief that has come to us by the loss of one country in this hemisphere, Cuba. How many other countries must be lost if the United States decides to end the programs that are helping these people, who are getting poorer every year, who have none of the resources of this great country, who look to us for help, but on the other hand in cases look to the Communists for example?\\r\\nThat is why I think this program is important. It is a means of assisting those who want to be free, and in the final analysis it serves the United States in a very real sense. That is why the United Nations is important, not because it can solve all these problems in this imperfect world, but it does give us a means, in those great moments of crisis, and in the last 21/2 years we have had at least three, when the Soviet Union and the United States were almost face to face on a collision course—it does give us a means of providing, as it has in the Congo, as it now is on the border of the Yemen, as it most recently was in a report of the United Nations at Malaysia—it does give a means to mobilize the opinion of the world to prevent an atomic disaster which would destroy us all wherever we might live.\\r\\nThat is why the test ban treaty is important as a first step, perhaps to be disappointed, perhaps to find ourselves ultimately set back, but at least in 1963 the United States committed itself, and the Senate of the United States, by an overwhelming vote, to one chance to end the radiation and the possibilities of burning.\\r\\nIt may be, as I said, that we may fail, but anyone who bothers to look at the true destructive power of the atom today and what we and the Soviet Union could do to each other and the world in an hour and in a day, and to Western Europe—I passed over yesterday the Little Big Horn where General Custer was slain, a massacre which has lived in history, 400 or 500 men. We are talking about 300 million men and women m 24 hours.\\r\\nI think it is wise to take a first step to lessen the possibility of that happening. And that is why our diplomacy is important. For the forces making for diversity are to be found everywhere where people are, even within the Communist empire, and it is our obligation to encourage those forces wherever they may be found. Hard and discouraging questions remain in Viet-Nam, in Cuba, in Laos, the Congo, all around the globe. The ordeal of the emerging nations has just begun. The control of nuclear weapons is still incomplete. The areas of potential friction, the chances of collision, still exist.\\r\\nBut in every one of these areas the position of the United States, I believe, is happier and safer when history is going for us rather than when it is going against us. And we have history going for us today, but history is what men make it. The future is what men make it.\\r\\nWe cannot fulfill our vision and our commitment and our interest in a free and diverse future without unceasing vigilance, devotion, and, most of all, perseverance, a willingness to stay with it, a willingness to do with fatigue, a willingness not to accept easy answers, but instead, to maintain the burden, as the people of this State have done for 100 years, and as the United States must do the rest of this century until finally we live in a peaceful world.\\r\\nTherefore, I think this country will continue its commitments to support the world of freedom, for as we discharge that commitment we are heeding the command which Brigham Young heard from the Lord more than a century ago, the command he conveyed to his followers, \\\"Go as pioneers . . . to a land of peace.\\\"\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"John F. Kennedy\",\"title\":\"September 26, 1963: Address at the Mormon Tabernacle\"},{\"doc_name\":\"september-30-1962-address-situation-university-mississippi\",\"date\":\"1962-09-30\",\"transcript\":\"The orders of the court in the case of Meredith versus Fair are beginning to be carried out. Mr. James Meredith is now in residence on the campus of the University of Mississippi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has been accomplished thus far without the use of National Guard or other troops. And it is to be hoped that the law enforcement officers of the State of Mississippi and the Federal marshals will continue to be sufficient in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll students, members of the faculty, and public officials in both Mississippi and the Nation will be able, it is hoped, to return to their normal activities with full confidence in the integrity of American law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is as it should be, for our Nation is founded on the principle that observance of the law is the eternal safeguard of liberty and defiance of the law is the surest road to tyranny. The law which we obey includes the final rulings of the courts, as well as the enactment's of our legislative bodies. Even among law-abiding men few laws are universally loved, but they are uniformly respected and not resisted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmericans are free, in short, to disagree with the law but not to disobey it. For in a government of laws and not of men, no man, however prominent or powerful, and no mob, however unruly or boisterous, is entitled to defy a court of law. If this country should ever reach the point where any man or group of men by force or threat of force could long defy the commands of our court and our Constitution, then no law would stand free from doubt, no judge would be sure of his writ, and no citizen would be safe from his neighbors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this case in which the United States Government was not until recently involved, Mr. Meredith brought a private suit in Federal court against those who were excluding him from the University. A series of Federal courts all the way to the Supreme Court repeatedly ordered Mr. Meredith's admission to the University. When those orders were defied, and those who sought to implement them threatened with arrest and violence, the United States Court of Appeals consisting of Chief Judge Tuttle of Georgia, Judge Hutcheson of Texas, Judge Rives of Alabama, Judge Jones of Florida, Judge Brown of Texas, Judge Wisdom of Louisiana, Judge Gewin of Alabama, and Judge Bell of Georgia, made clear the fact that the enforcement of its order had become an obligation of the United States Government. Even though this Government had not originally been a party to the case, my responsibility as President was therefore inescapable. I accept it. My obligation under the Constitution and the statutes of the United States was and is to implement the orders of the court with whatever means are necessary, and with as little force and civil disorder as the circumstances permit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was for this reason that I federalized the Mississippi National Guard as the most appropriate instrument, should any be needed, to preserve law and order while United States marshals carried out the orders of the court and prepared to back them up with whatever other civil or military enforcement might have been required.\\r\\n\\r\\nI deeply regret the fact that any action by the executive branch was necessary in this case, but all other avenues and alternatives, including persuasion and conciliation, had been tried and exhausted. Had the police powers of Mississippi been used to support the orders of the court, instead of deliberately and unlawfully blocking them, had the University of Mississippi fulfilled its standard of excellence by quietly admitting this applicant ' in conformity with what so many other southern State universities have done for so many years, a peaceable and sensible solution would have been possible without any Federal intervention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Nation is proud of the many instances in which Governors, educators, and everyday citizens from the South have shown to the world the gains that can be made by persuasion and good will in a society ruled by law. Specifically, I would like to take this occasion to express the thanks of this Nation to those southerners who have contributed to the progress of our democratic development in the entrance of students regardless of race to such great institutions as the State-supported universities of Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Kentucky.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recognize that the present period of transition and adjustment in our Nation's Southland is a hard one for many people. Neither Mississippi nor any other southern State deserves to be charged with all the accumulated wrongs of the last 100 years of race relations. To the extent that there has been failure, the responsibility for that failure must be shared by us all, by every State, by every citizen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMississippi and her University, moreover, are noted for their courage, for their contribution of talent and thought to the affairs of this Nation. This is the State of Lucius Lamar and many others who have placed the national good ahead of sectional interest. This is the State which had four Medal of Honor winners in the Korean war alone. In fact, the Guard unit federalized this morning, early, is part of the 155th Infantry, one of the 10 oldest regiments in the Union and one of the most decorated for sacrifice and bravery in 6 wars.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1945 a Mississippi sergeant, Jake Lindsey, was honored by an unusual joint session of the Congress. I close therefore with this appeal to the students of the University, the people who are most concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have a great tradition to uphold, a tradition of honor and courage won on the field of battle and on the gridiron as well as the University campus. You have a new opportunity to show that you are men of patriotism and integrity. For the most effective means of upholding the law is not the State policeman or the marshals or the National Guard. It is you. It lies in your courage to accept those laws with which you disagree as well as those with which you agree. The eyes of the Nation and of all the world are upon you and upon all of us, and the honor of your University and State are in the balance. I am certain that the great majority of the students will uphold that honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is in short no reason why the books on this case cannot now be quickly and quietly closed in the manner directed by the court. Let us preserve both the law and the peace and then healing those wounds that are within we can turn to the greater crises that are without and stand united as one people in our pledge to man's freedom.

(Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Good to be back. And Mitch and Chuck will understand it’s good to be almost home, down the hall. Anyway, thank you all.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadam Speaker, Madam Vice President—(applause)—no President has ever said those words from this podium. No President has ever said those words, and it’s about time. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Lady—(applause)—I’m her husband; Second Gentleman; Chief Justice; members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet; distinguished guests; my fellow Americans: While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different—a reminder of the extraordinary times we’re in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to Congress, to the nation, and to the world to declare war, to celebrate peace, to announce new plans and possibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I come to talk about crisis and opportunity, about rebuilding the nation, revitalizing our democracy, and winning the future for America.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stand here tonight, one day shy of the 100th day of my administration—100 days since I took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a nation—we all did—that was in crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again—(applause)—turning peril into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setbacks into strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all know life can knock us down. But in America, we never, ever, ever stay down. Americans always get up. Today, that’s what we’re doing: America is rising anew, choosing hope over fear, truth over lies, and light over darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff, in my view. We’re working again, dreaming again, discovering again, and leading the world again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have shown each other and the world that there’s no quit in America—none.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne hundred days ago, America’s house was on fire. We had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi; Malor-—Majority Leader Schumer; and the overwhelming support of the American people—Democrats, independents, and Republicans—we did act.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether we passed the American Rescue Plan—one of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We’re already seeing the results. (Applause.) We’re already seeing the results. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I promised we’d get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into people’s arms in 100 days, we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to all the help of all of you, we’re marshalling—with your help, everyone’s help—we’re marshalling every federal resource. We’ve gotten vaccines to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 Community Health Centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached. We’re setting up community vaccination sites, developing mobile units to get to hard-to-reach communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, 90 percent of Americans now live within five miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16—everyone is now eligible to get vaccinated right now, right away. (Applause.) Go get vaccinated, America. Go and get the vaccination. They’re available. You’re eligible now.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was sworn in on January 20th, less than 1 percent of the seniors in America were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. One hundred days later, 70 percent of seniors in America over 65 are protected—fully protected.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80 percent since January—down 80 percent because of all of you. And more than half of all the adults in America have gotten at least one shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse—I said, “What’s it like?” She looked at me and she said, “It’s like every shot is giving a dose of hope”—was the phrase. “A dose of hope.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune disease—wrote to me, said she’s worried—that she was worrying about bringing the virus home. She said she then got vaccinated at a—at a large site, in her car. She said she sat in her car, when she got vaccinated, and just cried—cried out of joy and cried out of relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nParents see the smiles on their kids’ faces, for those who are able to go back to school because the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a window to say goodbye.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt means everything. Those things mean everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, there’s still—you all know it; you know it better than any group of Americans—there’s still more work to do to beat this virus. We can’t let our guard down.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut tonight I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical achievements—logistical achievements this country has ever seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat else have we done in those first 100 days?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe kept our commitment—Democrats and Republicans—of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households. We’ve already sent more than one—160 million checks out the door. It’s making the difference. You all know it when you go home. For many people, it’s making all the difference in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nA single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said she couldn’t work, but she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nA grandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor—something she said she put off for months because she didn’t have the money. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the defining images, at least from my perspective, of this crisis has been cars lined up—cars lined up for miles. And not—not people who just barely ever start those cars—nice cars lined up for miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don’t know about you, but I didn’t ever think I’d see that in America. And all of this is through no fault of their own. No fault of their own these people are in this position.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re also providing rental assistance—you all know this, but the American people, I want to make sure they understand—keeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act when I established the special sign-up period to do that—800,000 in that period.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re making one of the largest one-time ever investments—ever—in improving healthcare for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we’re on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in the process, while this was all going on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 new jobs in 100 days—more jobs in the first—(applause)—more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Monetary Fund—(applause)—the International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 percent this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica is moving—moving forward—but we can’t stop now. We’re in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century. We’re at a great inflection point in history.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have to do more than just build back better—I mean “build back.” We have to build back better. We have to compete more strenuously than we have.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout our history, if you think about it, public investment and infrastructure has literally transformed America—our attitudes, as well as our opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe transcontinental railroad, the interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon—now we’re on Mars; discovering vaccines; gave us the Internet and so much more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the government was in a position to make. Time and again, they propel us into the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why I proposed the American Jobs Plan—a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. This is the largest jobs plan since World War Two.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors, transit lines. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s clean water. And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water—a clear and present danger to our children’s health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in the process, it will create thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed Internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn’t have it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st-century economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I am asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT:—because I know it will get done. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt creates jobs, building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, catastrophic failures—with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter storms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. We can do that. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careers.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic—two million. And too often because they couldn’t get the care they needed to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who needs help.\\r\\n\\r\\nEight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. If you think it’s not important, check out in your own district.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemocrat or Republican—Democrat or Republican voters, their great concern—almost as much as their children—is taking care of an elderly loved one who can’t be left alone. Medicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing a cycle of growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor too long, we’ve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis: “jobs.” Jobs. Jobs. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nFor me, when I think “climate change,” I think “jobs.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy-efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers—IBEW members—installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways so we can own—(applause)—so we can own the electric car market. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFarmers—farmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, but think about it: There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason. None. No reason. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, folks, there’s no reason why American—American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. I mean, there is no reason. We have this capacity. (Applause.) We have the brightest, best-trained people in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of good-paying jobs—jobs Americans can raise a family on—as my dad would then say, “with a little breathing room.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: Buy American. (Applause.) Buy American.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I might note, parenthetically—(applause)—that does not—that does not violate any trade agreement. It’s been the law since the ’30s: Buy American. \\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs. That’s the way it’s supposed to be and it will be in this administration. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I made it clear to all my Cabinet people. Their ability to give exemptions has been exstrenuously [sic] limited. It will be American products.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. So many of you—so many of the folks I grew up with feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that’s so rapidly changing. It’s frightening. \\r\\n\\r\\nI want to speak directly to you. Because if you think about it, that’s what people are most worried about: “Can I fit in?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIndependent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come. It is a—it is an eight-year program. These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree; 75 percent don’t require an associate’s degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. That’s what it is. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it recognizes something I’ve always said in this chamber and the other. Good guys and women on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn’t build this country. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Act—the PRO Act—and send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, by the way, while you’re thinking about sending things to my desk—(laughs)—let’s raise the minimum wage to $15. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one—no one working 40 hours a week—no one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. And while we’re doing this, let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as well—equal pay. It’s been much too long. And if you’re wondering whether it’s too long, look behind me. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and development on record. We will see more technological change—and some of you know more about this than I do—we’ll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50. That’s how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’re falling behind the competition with the rest of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nDecades ago, we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America—2 percent of our gross domestic product—in research and development. \\r\\n\\r\\nToday, Mr. Secretary, that’s less than 1 percent. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future:\\r\\nadvanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secretary of Defense can tell you—and those of you on—who work on national security issues know—the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA—the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. The people who set up before I came here—and that’s been a long time ago—to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security -– that’s their only job. And it’s a semi-separate agency; it’s under the Defense Department. It’s led to everything from the discovery of the Internet to GPS and so much more that has enhanced our security.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Institute of Health—the NIH –- I believe, should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that would—here’s what it would do. It would have a singular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President—almost $9 million going to NIH. And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I’ll never forget you standing and mentioning—saying you’d name it after my deceased son. It meant a lot.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut so many of us have deceased sons, daughters, and relatives who died of cancer. I can think of no more worthy investment. I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. So, let’s end cancer as we know it. (Applause.) It’s within our power. (Applause.) It’s within our power to do it. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we’re talking about, have often had bipartisan support in the past. Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican senators who just put forward their own proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, let’s get to work. I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the deep discussions. I’d like to meet with those who have ideas that are different—they think are better. I welcome those ideas. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut the rest of the world is not waiting for us. I just want to be clear: From my perspective, doing nothing is not an option. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, we can’t be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi—traveled over 17,000 miles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him. When he called to congratulate me, we had a two-hour discussion. He’s deadly earnest about becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world. He and others—autocrats—think that democracy can’t compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families and our children. That’s why I’ve introduced the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst is access to a good education. When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world. It’s, I believe, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st—in the 20th century. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut the world has caught up, or catching up. They are not waiting. I would say, parenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, “Okay, we’re going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education,” I wonder whether we’d think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century. I doubt it. Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st Century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why my American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great universities of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years. It shows that adding two years of universal high-quality preschool for every three-year-old and four-year-old, no matter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years. It increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on beyond graduation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe research shows when a young child goes to school—not daycare—they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you add two years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the dynamic. (Applause.) We can do that. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’ll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, Minority-Serving Institutions. The reason is: They don’t have the endowments, but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy—all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nJill was a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She has long said—(applause). She has long—(applause). If I’ve heard it once, I’ve heard it a thousand times: “Joe, any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us.” She’ll be deeply involved in leading this effort. Thank you, Jill.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable childcare. We guarantee—(applause). And I’m proposing a legislation to guarantee that low- and middle-income families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and medical leave—family and medical leave. We’re one of the few industrial countries in the world—(applause). \\r\\n\\r\\nNo one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones –- a parent, a spouse, or child.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans. In March, we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 per child if they’re under [over] six years of age—I mean, excuse me—under—over six years of age, and $3,600 for children over [under] six years of age.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith two parents, two kids, that’s $7,200 in the pockets that’s going to help to take care of your family. And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child] poverty in half. (Applause.) And we can afford it. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo we did that in the rec-—in the—in the last piece of legislation we passed. But let’s extend that Child Care Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I know that’s really popular on this side of the aisle. (Laughter.) But let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to my Families Plan, I’m going to work with Congress to address, this year, other critical priorities for American families. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women’s health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly—how badly it’s needed. Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care—in the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.) And let’s lower prescription drug costs. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nWe know how to do this. The last President had that as an objective. We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in America—nearly three times—for the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay. We have to change that, and we can. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s do what we’ve always talked about for all the years I was down here in this—in this body—in Congress. Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, by the way, that won’t just—that won’t just help people on Medicare; it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny. It’s within our power to do it; let’s do it now. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve talked about it long enough. Democrats and Republicans, let’s get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege in America. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan? I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits. Let’s start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000. It’s—but it’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share. (Applause.) Just their fair share. \\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party. I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share.\\r\\n\\r\\nA recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero federal tax last year. Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit. A lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. It’s not right. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re going to reward work, not just wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans—those making over $400,000 or more—back up to where it was when George W. Bush was President when he started: 39.6 percent. That’s where it was when George W. was President. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million dollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a paycheck.  We’re only going to affect three tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by that action. Three tenths of 1 percent. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. It’s estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that are left, right, and center. \\r\\n\\r\\nI’m not looking to punish anybody. But I will not add a tax burden—an additional tax burden to the middle class in this country. They’re already paying enough. I believe what I propose is fair—(applause)—fiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed, and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you hear someone say that they don’t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or corporate America, ask them: “Whose taxes you want to raise instead? Whose are you going to cut?” \\r\\n\\r\\nLook, the big tax cut of 2017—remember, it was supposed to pay for itself—that was how it was sold—and generate vast economic growth. Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of using the tax saving to raise wages and invest in research and development, it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history. \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to one study, CEOs make 320 times what the average worker in their corporation makes. It used to be in the—below a hundred. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pandemic has only made things worse. Twenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemic—working- and middle-class Americans. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion—in the same exact period. Let me say it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during this pandemic. And they’re now worth more than $4 trillion. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, trickle-down—trickle-down economics has never worked and it’s time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, there’s a broad consensus of economists—left, right, center—and they agree what I’m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest-value investments we can make as a nation. \\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our power.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my conversations with world leaders—and I’ve spoken to over 38, 40 of them now—I’ve made it known—I’ve made it known that America is back. And you know what they say? The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say, “We see America is back but for how long? But for how long?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we’re back, but that we’re back to stay and that we aren’t going to go it alone. (Applause.) We’re going to do it by leading with our allies. (Applause.)  \\r\\n\\r\\nNo one nation can deal with all the crises of our time—from terrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well as experi-—what we’re experiencing now with pandemics. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s no wall high enough to keep any virus out. And our own vaccine supply—as it grows to meet our needs; and we’re meeting them—will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries, just as America was the arsenal of democracy for the world—(applause)—and in consequence, influenced the world. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBut every American will have access before that occur-—every American will have access to be fully covered by COVID-19—from the vaccines we have.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, the climate crisis is not our fight alone; it’s a global fight. The United States accounts, as all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85 percent. That’s why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Accord—because if we do everything perfectly, it’s not going to ultimately matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the major economies of the world—China, Russia, India, the European Union—and I said I’d do it in my first 100 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to be very blunt about it: I had—my attempt was to make sure that the world could see there was a consensus, that we are at an inflection point in history. And consensus—the consensus is: If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you’ve watched any of it—and you were all busy; I’m sure you didn’t have much time—that’s what virtually every nation said, even the ones that aren’t doing their fair share.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe investments I’ve proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy, in my view, that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my discussions—in my discussions with President Xi, I told him, “We welcome the competition. We’re not looking for conflict.” But I made absolutely clear that we will defend America’s interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from state—to state-owned operations and enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also told President Xi that we’ll maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific, just as we do with NATO in Europe—not to start a conflict, but to prevent one. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nI told him what I’ve said to many world leaders: that America will not back away from our commitments—our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms and to our alliances.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I pointed out to him: No responsible American President could remain silent when basic human rights are being so blatantly violated. An American President—President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for. America is an idea—the most unique idea in history: We are created, all of us, equal. It’s who we are, and we cannot walk away from that principle and, in fact, say we’re dealing with the American idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to Russia, I know it concerns some of you, but I made very clear to Putin that we’re not going to seek esca-—ecala-—exc-—excuse me—escalation, but their actions will have consequence if they turn out to be true. And they turned out to be true, so I responded directly and proportionally to Russia’s interference in our elections and the cyberattacks on our government and our business. They did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we can also cooperate when it’s in our mutual interest. We did it when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we’re working to do it on climate change. But he understands we will respond.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Iran and North Korea—nuclear programs that present serious threats to American security and the security of the world—we’re going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through di-—through diplomacy, as well as stern deterrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. (Applause.) We have—(applause)—we have, without hyperbole, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. I’m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a warzone. \\r\\n\\r\\nToday we have servicemembers serving in the same warzone as their parents did. We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe War in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be multi-generational undertakings of nation-building. We went to Afghanistan to get terrorists—the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11—and we said we would follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell to do it. If you’ve been to the upper Kunar Valley, you’ve kind of seen the gates of hell. And we delivered justice to bin Laden. We degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. And after 20 years of value—valor and sacrifice, it’s time to bring those troops home. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nLook, even as we do, we will maintain an over-the-horizon capacity to suppress future threats to the homeland. And make no mistake: In 20 years, terrorists has—terrorism has metastasized. The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan. And those of you in the intelligence committees, the foreign relations committee, the defense committees, you know well: We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in Africa, the Middle East, and beyond. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we won’t ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism. We’re not going to ignore that either.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this nation. It was nearly a year ago, before her father’s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd’s young daughter. She’s a little tyke, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the eye. And she looked at me and she said, “My daddy changed the world.” Well, after the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right she was if—if we have the courage to act as a Congress. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans. Now is our opportunity to make some real progress. The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our communities, and they serve them honorably. I know them. I know they want—(applause)—I know they want to help meet this moment as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and to enact police reform in George Floyd’s name that passed the House already. \\r\\n\\r\\nI know Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate. We need to work together to find a consensus. But let’s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nThe country supports this reform, and Congress should act—should act. We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justice—real justice. And with the plans outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America and American lives in other ways; a chance to deliver real equity—good jobs, good schools, affordable housing, clean air, clean water, being able to generate wealth and pass it down two generations because you have an access to purchase a house. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans—Black, white, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, I also want to thank the United States Senate for voting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. (Applause.) You acted decisively. (Applause.) And you can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we’ve seen over the past year—this past year and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk, which I will gladly, anxiously sign.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans. (Applause.) To all transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people who are so brave, I want you to know your President has your back.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother thing: Let’s authorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law for 27 years. (Applause.) Twenty-seven years ago, I wrote it. It’ll close the—the act that has to be authorized now will close the “boyfriend” loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. The court order said, “This is an abuser. You can’t own a gun.” It’s to close that loophole that existed. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, it’s estimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America—50 a month. Let’s pass it and save some lives. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I need not—I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America—250 shot dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the ’90s, we passed universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. Check out the report in over 10 years. But in the early twe-—2000s, the law expired, and we’ve seen daily bloodshed since. I’m not saying if the law continued, we wouldn’t see bloodshed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know—the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence—I laid out several of the Department of Justice a-—actions that are being taken to—impact on this epidemic. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of them is banning so-called “ghost guns.” These are homemade guns built from a kit that includes directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers, so they show up at crime scenes and they can’t be traced. The buyers of these ghost gun kits aren’t required to pass any background check. Anyone, from a criminal or terrorist, could buy this kit and within 30 minutes have a weapon that’s lethal. But no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it’s time for Congress to act as well. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, I don’t want to become confrontational but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democrat colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don’t tell me it can’t be done. We did it before, and it worked.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having 100 rounds in a weapon. What do you think—deer are wearing Kevlar vests? (Laughter.) They’ll tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun but shouldn’t be able to buy a gun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, including many gun owners. The country supports reform and is—and Congress should act.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis shouldn’t be a red or blue issue. And no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. You can’t yell “Fire!” in a crowded theater. From the very beginning, there were certain guns, weapons, that could not be owned by Americans. Certain people could not own those weapons ever. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re not changing the Constitution; we’re being reasonable. I think this is not a Democrat or Republican issue; I think it’s an American issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here’s what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to America. Let’s end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we’ve done nothing about it. It’s time to fix it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn day one of my presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 11 million undocumented folks—the vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it. We can actually—if you actually want to solve a problem, I’ve sent a bill to take a close look at it. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have to—also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing, particularly to—to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador: the violence, the corruption, the gangs, and the political instability, hunger, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was President, my President—when I was Vice President, the President asked me to focus on providing the help needed to address the root causes of migration. And it helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. The plan was working, but the last administration decided it was not worth it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this. I have absolute confidence she’ll get the job done. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, look, if you don’t like my plan, let’s at least pass what we all agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for DREAMers—the young people who have only known America as their home. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and natural-made violence and disaster. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nLook, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let’s argue over it, let’s debate it, but let’s act. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if we truly want to restore the soul of America, we need to protect the sacred right to vote. Most people—(applause).\\r\\n\\r\\nMore people voted in the last presidential election than any time in American history, in the middle of the worst pandemic ever. It should be celebrated. Instead, it’s being attacked.\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my desk right away. (Applause.) The country supports it. The Congress should act now. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, in closing, as we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol, desecrating our democracy, remain vivid in all our minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nLives were put at risk—many of your lives. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisis –- a test of whether our democracy could survive. And it did.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent, as old as our Republic—still vital today. \\r\\n\\r\\nCan our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us, created equal in the image of God, have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility?\\r\\n\\r\\nCan our democracy deliver the most—to the most pressing needs of our people? \\r\\n\\r\\nCan our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate, and fears that have pulled us apart?\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica’s adversaries –- the autocrats of the world –- are betting we can’t. And I promise you, they’re betting we can’t. They believe we’re too full of anger and division and rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey look at the images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. But they are wrong. You know it; I know it. But we have to prove them wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have to prove democracy still works—that our government still works and we can deliver for our people.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our first 100 days together, we have acted to restore the people’s faith in democracy to deliver. We’re vaccinating the nation. We’re creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. We’re delivering real results to people; they can see it and feel it in their own lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice—that’s the essence of America. That’s democracy in action.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Constitution opens with the words—as trite as it sounds—“We the People”. Well, it’s time to remember that “We the People” are the government—you and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force that we have no control over. It’s us. It’s “We the People.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us, “In America, we do our part.” We all do our part. That’s all I’m asking: that we do our part, all of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. Autocrats will not win the future. We will. America will. And the future belongs to America.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I stand here tonight before you, in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our nation, and I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or optimistic about America—not because I’m President, because what’s happening with the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain, and “We the People” did not flinch.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail, we came together. We united.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith light and hope, we summoned a new strength, new resolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century, on our way to a union more perfect, more prosperous, and more just, as one people, one nation, and one America.\\r\\n\\r\\nFolks, as I told every world leader I’ve ever met with over the years, it’s never ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn’t. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are the United States of America. (Applause.) There is not a single thing—nothing—nothing beyond our capacity. We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together. (Applause.) So let’s begin to get together. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nGod bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience. (Applause.)\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"April 28, 2021: Address to Joint Session of Congress\"},{\"doc_name\":\"august-16-2021-remarks-situation-afghanistan\",\"date\":\"2021-08-16\",\"transcript\":\"THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. I want to speak today to the unfolding situation in Afghanistan: the developments that have taken place in the last week and the steps we’re taking to address the rapidly evolving events.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy national security team and I have been closely monitoring the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and moving quickly to execute the plans we had put in place to respond to every constituency, including—and contingency—including the rapid collapse we’re seeing now.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ll speak more in a moment about the specific steps we’re taking, but I want to remind everyone how we got here and what America’s interests are in Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went to Afghanistan almost 20 years ago with clear goals: get those who attacked us on September 11th, 2001, and make sure al Qaeda could not use Afghanistan as a base from which to attack us again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did that. We severely degraded al Qaeda in Afghanistan. We never gave up the hunt for Osama bin Laden, and we got him. That was a decade ago. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation building. It was never supposed to be creating a unified, centralized democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur only vital national interest in Afghanistan remains today what it has always been: preventing a terrorist attack on American homeland.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve argued for many years that our mission should be narrowly focused on counterterrorism—not counterinsurgency or nation building. That’s why I opposed the surge when it was proposed in 2009 when I was Vice President.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that’s why, as President, I am adamant that we focus on the threats we face today in 2021—not yesterday’s threats.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the terrorist threat has metastasized well beyond Afghanistan: al Shabaab in Somalia, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Nusra in Syria, ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq and establishing affiliates in multiple countries in Africa and Asia. These threats warrant our attention and our resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe conduct effective counterterrorism missions against terrorist groups in multiple countries where we don’t have a permanent military presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf necessary, we will do the same in Afghanistan. We’ve developed counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region and to act quickly and decisively if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came into office, I inherited a deal that President Trump negotiated with the Taliban. Under his agreement, U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by May 1, 2021—just a little over three months after I took office.\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. forces had already drawn down during the Trump administration from roughly 15,500 American forces to 2,500 troops in country, and the Taliban was at its strongest militarily since 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe choice I had to make, as your President, was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban in the middle of the spring fighting season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere would have been no ceasefire after May 1. There was no agreement protecting our forces after May 1. There was no status quo of stability without American casualties after May 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was only the cold reality of either following through on the agreement to withdraw our forces or escalating the conflict and sending thousands more American troops back into combat in Afghanistan, lurching into the third decade of conflict. \\r\\n\\r\\nI stand squarely behind my decision. After 20 years, I’ve learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why we were still there. We were clear-eyed about the risks. We planned for every contingency.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I always promised the American people that I will be straight with you. The truth is: This did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what’s happened? Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometimes without trying to fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf anything, the developments of the past week reinforced that ending U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan now was the right decision. \\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves. We spent over a trillion dollars. We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300,000 strong—incredibly well equipped—a force larger in size than the militaries of many of our NATO allies. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe gave them every tool they could need. We paid their salaries, provided for the maintenance of their air force—something the Taliban doesn’t have. Taliban does not have an air force. We provided close air support. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe gave them every chance to determine their own future. What we could not provide them was the will to fight for that future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s some very brave and capable Afghan special forces units and soldiers, but if Afghanistan is unable to mount any real resistance to the Taliban now, there is no chance that 1 year—1 more year, 5 more years, or 20 more years of U.S. military boots on the ground would’ve made any difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here’s what I believe to my core: It is wrong to order American troops to step up when Afghanistan’s own armed forces would not. If the political leaders of Afghanistan were unable to come together for the good of their people, unable to negotiate for the future of their country when the chips were down, they would never have done so while U.S. troops remained in Afghanistan bearing the brunt of the fighting for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd our true strategic competitors—China and Russia—would love nothing more than the United States to continue to funnel billions of dollars in resources and attention into stabilizing Afghanistan indefinitely.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I hosted President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah at the White House in June and again when I spoke by phone to Ghani in July, we had very frank conversations. We talked about how Afghanistan should prepare to fight their civil wars after the U.S. military departed, to clean up the corruption in government so the government could function for the Afghan people. We talked extensively about the need for Afghan leaders to unite politically. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey failed to do any of that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also urged them to engage in diplomacy, to seek a political settlement with the Taliban. This advice was flatly refused. Mr. Ghani insisted the Afghan forces would fight, but obviously he was wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I’m left again to ask of those who argue that we should stay: How many more generations of America’s daughters and sons would you have me send to fight Afghans—Afghanistan’s civil war when Afghan troops will not?  How many more lives—American lives—is it worth? How many endless rows of headstones at Arlington National Cemetery?\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m clear on my answer: I will not repeat the mistakes we’ve made in the past—the mistake of staying and fighting indefinitely in a conflict that is not in the national interest of the United States, of doubling down on a civil war in a foreign country, of attempting to remake a country through the endless military deployments of U.S. forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose are the mistakes we cannot continue to repeat, because we have significant vital interests in the world that we cannot afford to ignore.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also want to acknowledge how painful this is to so many of us. The scenes we’re seeing in Afghanistan, they’re gut-wrenching, particularly for our veterans, our diplomats, humanitarian workers, for anyone who has spent time on the ground working to support the Afghan people.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan and for Americans who have fought and served in the country—serve our country in Afghanistan—this is deeply, deeply personal.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is for me as well. I’ve worked on these issues as long as anyone. I’ve been throughout Afghanistan during this war—while the war was going on—from Kabul to Kandahar to the Kunar Valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve traveled there on four different occasions. I met with the people. I’ve spoken to the leaders. I spent time with our troops. And I came to understand firsthand what was and was not possible in Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, now we’re fercus [sic]—focused on what is possible. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will continue to support the Afghan people. We will lead with our diplomacy, our international influence, and our humanitarian aid.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll continue to push for regional diplomacy and engagement to prevent violence and instability.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll continue to speak out for the basic rights of the Afghan people—of women and girls—just as we speak out all over the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been clear that human rights must be the center of our foreign policy, not the periphery. But the way to do it is not through endless military deployments; it’s with our diplomacy, our economic tools, and rallying the world to join us. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, let me lay out the current mission in Afghanistan. I was asked to authorize—and I did—6,000 U.S. troops to deploy to Afghanistan for the purpose of assisting in the departure of U.S. and Allied civilian personnel from Afghanistan, and to evacuate our Afghan allies and vulnerable Afghans to safety outside of Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur troops are working to secure the airfield and to ensure continued operation of both the civilian and military flights. We’re taking over air traffic control. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have safely shut down our embassy and transferred our diplomats. Our dip-—our diplomatic presence is now consolidated at the airport as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the coming days, we intend to transport out thousands of American citizens who have been living and working in Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll also continue to support the safe departure of civilian personnel—the civilian personnel of our Allies who are still serving in Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperation Allies Refugee [Refuge], which I announced back in July, has already moved 2,000 Afghans who are eligible for Special Immigration Visas and their families to the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the coming days, the U.S. military will provide assistance to move more SIV-eligible Afghans and their families out of Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re also expanding refugee access to cover other vulnerable Afghans who worked for our embassy: U.S. non-governmental agencies—or the U.S. non-governmental organizations; and Afghans who otherwise are at great risk; and U.S. news agencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know that there are concerns about why we did not begin evacuating Afghans—civilians sooner. Part of the answer is some of the Afghans did not want to leave earlier—still hopeful for their country. And part of it was because the Afghan government and its supporters discouraged us from organizing a mass exodus to avoid triggering, as they said, “a crisis of confidence.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican troops are performing this mission as professionally and as effectively as they always do, but it is not without risks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we carry out this departure, we have made it clear to the Taliban: If they attack our personnel or disrupt our operation, the U.S. presence will be swift and the response will be swift and forceful. We will defend our people with devastating force if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur current military mission will be short in time, limited in scope, and focused in its objectives: Get our people and our allies to safety as quickly as possible. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd once we have completed this mission, we will conclude our military withdrawal. We will end America’s longest war after 20 long years of bloodshed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe events we’re seeing now are sadly proof that no amount of military force would ever deliver a stable, united, and secure Afghanistan—as known in history as the “graveyard of empires.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is happening now could just as easily have happened 5 years ago or 15 years in the future. We have to be honest: Our mission in Afghanistan has taken many missteps—made many missteps over the past two decades. \\r\\n\\r\\nI’m now the fourth American President to preside over war in Afghanistan—two Democrats and two Republicans. I will not pass this responsibly on—responsibility on to a fifth President.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will not mislead the American people by claiming that just a little more time in Afghanistan will make all the difference. Nor will I shrink from my share of responsibility for where we are today and how we must move forward from here.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am President of the United States of America, and the buck stops with me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am deeply saddened by the facts we now face. But I do not regret my decision to end America’s warfighting in Afghanistan and maintain a laser-focus on our counterterrorism missions there and in other parts of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur mission to degrade the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and kill Osama bin Laden was a success.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur decades-long effort to overcome centuries of history and permanently change and remake Afghanistan was not, and I wrote and believed it never could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot and I will not ask our troops to fight on endlessly in another—in another country’s civil war, taking casualties, suffering life-shattering injuries, leaving families broken by grief and loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not in our national security interest. It is not what the American people want. It is not what our troops, who have sacrificed so much over the past two decades, deserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nI made a commitment to the American people when I ran for President that I would bring America’s military involvement in Afghanistan to an end. And while it’s been hard and messy—and yes, far from perfect—I’ve honored that commitment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore importantly, I made a commitment to the brave men and women who serve this nation that I wasn’t going to ask them to continue to risk their lives in a military action that should have ended long ago. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur leaders did that in Vietnam when I got here as a young man. I will not do it in Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know my decision will be criticized, but I would rather take all that criticism than pass this decision on to another President of the United States—yet another one—a fifth one. \\r\\n\\r\\nBecause it’s the right one—it’s the right decision for our people. The right one for our brave service members who have risked their lives serving our nation. And it’s the right one for America. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, thank you. May God protect our troops, our diplomats, and all of the brave Americans serving in harm’s way.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"August 16, 2021: Remarks on Situation in Afghanistan\"},{\"doc_name\":\"august-26-2021-statement-terror-attacks-afghanistan\",\"date\":\"2021-08-26\",\"transcript\":\"THE PRESIDENT: Been a tough day. This evening in Kabul, as you all know, terrorists attacked—that we’ve been talking about and worried about, that the intelligence community has assessed has [was] undertaken—an attack—by a group known as ISIS-K—took the lives of American service members standing guard at the airport, and wounded several others seriously. They also wounded a number of civilians, and civilians were killed as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve been engaged all day and in constant contact with the military commanders here in Washington, the Pentagon, as well as in Afghanistan and Doha. And my commanders here in Washington and in the field have been on this with great detail, and you’ve had a chance to speak to some, so far.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation on the ground is still evolving, and I’m constantly being updated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese American service members who gave their lives—it’s an overused word, but it’s totally appropriate—they were heroes. Heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were part of an airlift, an evacuation effort unlike any seen in history, with more than 100,000 American citizens, American partners, Afghans who helped us, and others taken to safety in the last 11 days. Just in the last 12 hours or so, another 7,000 have gotten out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were part of the bravest, most capable, and the most selfless military on the face of the Earth. And they were part of, simply, what I call the “backbone of America.” They’re the spine of America, the best the country has to offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nJill and I—our hearts ache, like I’m sure all of you do as well, for all those Afghan families who have lost loved ones, including small children, or been wounded in this vicious attack. And we’re outraged as well as heartbroken.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing the father of an Army major who served for a year in Iraq and, before that, was in Kosovo as a U.S. attorney for the better part of six months in the middle of a war—when he came home after a year in Iraq, he was diagnosed, like many, many coming home, with an aggressive and lethal cancer of the brain—who we lost. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have some sense, like many of you do, what the families of these brave heroes are feeling today. You get this feeling like you’re being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest; there’s no way out. My heart aches for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I know this: We have a continuing obligation, a sacred obligation to all of you—the families of those heroes. That obligation is not temporary; it lasts forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lives we lost today were lives given in the service of liberty, the service of security, in the service of others, in the service of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike their fellow brothers and sisters in arms who died defending our vision and our values in the struggle against terrorism of—the fallen this day, they’re part of a great and noble company of American heroes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the past few weeks—I know you’re—many of you are probably tired of hearing me say it—we’ve been made aware by our intelligence community that the ISIS-K—an arch-enemy of the Taliban; people who were freed when both those prisons were opened—has been planning a complex set of attacks on the United States personnel and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is why, from the outset, I’ve repeatedly said this mission was extraordinarily dangerous and why I have been so determined to limit the duration of this mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as General McKenzie said, this is why our mission was designed—this is the way it was designed to operate: operate under severe stress and attack. We’ve known that from the beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as I’ve been in constant contact with our senior military leaders—and I mean constant, around the clock—and our commanders on the ground and throughout the day, they made it clear that we can and we must complete this mission, and we will. And that’s what I’ve ordered them to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership, and facilities. We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose, and the moment of our choosing. \\r\\n\\r\\nHere is what you need to know: These ISIS terrorists will not win. We will rescue the Americans who are there. We will get out our Afghan allies out, and our mission will go on. \\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica will not be intimidated. \\r\\n\\r\\nI have the utmost confidence in our brave service members who continue to execute this mission with courage and honor to save lives and get Americans, our partners, our Afghan allies out of Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day when I talk to our commanders, I ask them what they need—what more do they need, if anything, to get the job done. As they will tell you, I granted every request. \\r\\n\\r\\nI reiterated to them again today, on three occasions, that they should take the maximum steps necessary to protect our forces on the ground in Kabul.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I also want to thank the Secretary of Defense and the military leadership at the Pentagon, and all the commanders in the field. There has been complete unanimity from every commander on the objectives of this mission and the best way to achieve those objectives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who have served through the ages have drawn inspiration from the Book of Isaiah, when the Lord says, “Whom shall I send…who shall go for us?” And the American military has been answering for a long time: “Here am I, Lord. Send me.” “Here I am. Send me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEach one of these women and men of our armed forces are the heirs of that tradition of sacrifice of volunteering to go into harm’s way, to risk everything—not for glory, not for profit, but to defend what we love and the people we love.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I ask that you join me now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out uniform—military and civilian, who have given the last full measure of devotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n(A moment of silence is taken.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you. May God bless you all. And may God protect those troops and all those standing watch for America. We have so much to do. It’s within our capacity to do it. We just have to remain steadfast. Steadfast. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will complete our mission. And we will continue, after our troops have withdrawn, to find means by which we defined any American who wishes to get out of Afghanistan. We will find them and we will get them out. \\r\\n\\r\\nLadies and gentlemen, they gave me a list here. The first person I was instructed to call on was Kelly O’Donnell of NBC.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ Mr. President, you have said leaving Afghanistan is in the national interest of the United States. After today’s attack, do you believe you will authorize additional forces to respond to that attack inside Afghanistan? And are you—are you prepared to add additional forces to protect those Americans who remain on the ground carrying out the evacuation operation?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I’ve instructed the military, whatever they need—if they need additional force—I will grant it. But the military—from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Joint Chiefs, the commanders in the field—have all contacted me one way or another, usually by letter, saying they subscribe to the mission as designed to get as many people out as we can within the timeframe that is allotted. That is the best way, they believe, to get as many Americans out as possible, and others. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with regard to finding, tracking down the ISIS leaders who ordered this, we have some reason to believe we know who they are—not certain—and we will find ways of our choosing, without large military operations, to get them.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Inside Afghanistan, Mr. President?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Wherever they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrevor from Reuters.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. There has been some criticism, even from people in your party, about the dependence on the Taliban to secure the perimeter of the airport. Do you feel like there was a mistake made in that regard?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I don’t. Look, I think General McKenzie handled this question very well. The fact is that we’re in a situation—we inherited a situation, particularly since, as we all know, that the Afghan military collapsed 11 days before—in 11 days—that it is in the interest of, as Mackenzie said, in the interest of the Taliban that, in fact, ISIS-K does not metastasize beyond what it is, number one. And number two, it’s in their interest that we are able to leave on time, on target. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a consequence of that, the major things we’ve asked them—moving back the perimeter; give me more space between the wall; stopping vehicles from coming through, et cetera; searching people coming through—it is not what you’d call a tightly commanded, regimented operation like the U.S. is—the military is—but they’re acting in their interest—their interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, by and large—and I’ve asked this same question to military on the ground, whether or not it’s a useful exercise. No one trusts them; we’re just counting on their self-interest to continue to generate their activities. And it’s in their self-interest that we leave when we said and that we get as many people out as we can.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd like I said, even in the midst of everything that happened today, over 7,000 people have gotten out; over 5,000 Americans overall.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, it’s not a matter of trust, it’s a matter of mutual self-interest. And—but there is no evidence thus far that I’ve been given, as a consequence by any of our commanders in the field, that there has been collusion between the Taliban and ISIS in carrying out what happened today both in front of the hotel and what is expected to continue for—beyond today.\\r\\n\\r\\nAamer, Associated Press.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. You have spoken again powerfully about your own son and the weight of these decisions. With that in mind—and also what you’ve said: that the longer we stay, the more likelihood that there would be a major attack—how do you weigh staying even one more day, considering what’s happened?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Because I think what America says matters. What we say we’re going to do and the context in which we say we’re going to do it, that we do it—unless something exceptional changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are additional American citizens, there are additional green card holders, there are additional personnel of our allies, there are additional SIV card holders, there are additional Afghans that have helped us, and there are additional groups of individuals that have contacted us from women’s groups, to NGOs, and others, who have expressly indicated they want to get out and have gathered in certain circumstances in groups, on buses and other means, that still presents the opportunity for the next several days, between now and the 31st, to be able to get them out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd our military—and, I believe, to the extent that we can do that knowing the threat, knowing that we may very well have another attack—the military has concluded that’s what we should do. I think they’re right. I think they’re correct.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd after that, we’re going to be in a circumstance where there are—will be, I believe, numerous opportunities to continue to provide access for additional persons to get out of Afghanistan, either through means that we provide and/or are provided through cooperation with the Taliban. They’re not good guys, the Taliban. I’m not suggesting that at all. But they have a keen interest. As many of you have been reporting, they very much would like to figure out how to keep the airport open. They don’t have the capacity to do it. They very much are trying to figure out whether or not they can maintain what is the portion of an economy that has become not robust, but fundamentally different than it had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so there’s a lot of reasons why they have reached out not just to us, but to others, as to why it would be continued in their interest to get more of the personnel we want to get out. We can locate them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, there’s not many left that we can assess that are—want to come out. There’s some Americans we’ve identified—we’ve contacted the vast majority of them, if not all of them—who don’t want to leave because they have sig-—they’re dual nationals, they have extended families, et cetera. And there’s others who are looking for the time. So, that’s why we continue.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ll take a few more questions, and—but, you, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I didn’t pick you, but that’s okay. (Laughs.)\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: I wanted to ask you—you say that “what America says matters.” What do you say to the Afghans who helped troops, who may not be able to get out by August 31st? What —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I say —\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: What do you say to them?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT:—we’re going to continue to try to get you out. It matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, I know of no conflict, as a student of history—no conflict where, when a war was ending, one side was able to guarantee that everyone that wanted to be extracted from that country would get out. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd think about it, folks. I think it’s important for—I know the American people get this in their gut. There are, I would argue, millions of Afghani citizens who are not Taliban; who did not actively cooperate with us as SIVs; who, if given a chance, they’d be onboard a plane tomorrow. It sounds ridiculous, but the vast majority of people in communities like that want to come to America, given a choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, getting every single person out is—can’t be guaranteed to anybody because there’s a determination, all who wants to get out as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any rate, it’s a process.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was really pointing to you, but—you, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. There are reports that U.S. officials provided the Taliban with names of Americans and Afghan officials to evacuate. Were you aware of that? Did that happen?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, sir, did you personally reject a recommendation to hold, or to recapture Bagram Air Force Base?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Here’s what I’ve done on the—ask this—I’ll answer the last question, first. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the tactical questions of how to conduct an evacuation or a war, I gather up all the major military personnel that are in Afghanistan—the commanders, as well as the Pentagon. And I ask for their best military judgment: what would be the most efficient way to accomplish the mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey concluded—the military—that Bagram was not much value added, that it was much wiser to focus on Kabul. And so, I followed that recommendation. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to—there are certain circumstances where we’ve gotten information—and quite frankly, sometimes from some of you—saying, “You know of such and such a group of people who are trying to get out and they’re on a bus, they’re moving…”—from other people—“and this is their location.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there have been occasions when our military has contacted their military counterparts in the Taliban and said, “This…”—for example, “This bus is coming through with X number of people on it, made up of the following group of people. We want you to let that bus or that group through.” \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, yes, there have been occasions like that. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to the best of my knowledge, in those cases, the bulk of that has occurred—they’ve been let through. But I can’t tell you with any certitude that there’s actually been a list of names. I don’t—there may have been, but I know of no circumstance. It doesn’t mean it’s not—it didn’t exist, that, “Here’s the names of 12 people; they’re coming. Let them through.” It could very well have happened. \\r\\n\\r\\nI’ll take one more question.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, can I —\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, right here. Mr. President —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Let me take the one question from the most interesting guy that I know in the press. \\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. Is that—is there—thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: That’s you. (Laughter.)\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, there had not been a U.S. service member killed in combat in Afghanistan since February of 2020. You set a deadline. You pulled troops out. You sent troops back in. And now 12 Marines are dead. You said the buck stops with you. Do you bear any responsibility for the way that things have unfolded in the last two weeks?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I bear responsibility for, fundamentally, all that’s happened of late.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here’s the deal: You know—I wish you’d one day say these things—you know as well as I do that the former President made a deal with the Taliban that he would get all American forces out of Afghanistan by May 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn return, the commitment was made—and that was a year before—in return, he was given a commitment that the Taliban would continue to attack others, but would not attack any American forces. \\r\\n\\r\\nRemember that? I’m being serious. \\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I—I’m asking you a question. Be a—because before I —\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Donald Trump is not the President right now.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, no—now wait a minute. I’m asking you a question. Is that—is that accurate, to the best of your knowledge?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: I know what you’re talking about. But, Mr. President, respectfully—\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: What?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ:—since—I don’t think that the issue that—do you think that people have an issue with pulling out of Afghanistan, or just the way that things have happened? \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I think they have an issue that people are likely to get hurt—some, as we’ve seen, have gotten killed—and that it is messy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason why—whether my friend will acknowledge it and was—reported it—the reason why there were no attacks on Americans, as you said, from the date until I came into office, was because the commitment was made by President Trump: “I will be out by May 1st. In the meantime, you agree not to attack any Americans.” That was the deal. That’s why no American was attacked.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: And you said that you still—a few days ago, you said you squarely stand by your decision to pull out.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes, I do. Because look at it this way, folks—and I’m going to—I have another meeting, for real. But imagine where we’d be if I had indicated, on May the 1st, I was not going to renegotiate an evacuation date; we were going to stay there.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’d have only one alternative: Pour thousands of more troops back into Afghanistan to fight a war that we had already won, relative—is why the reason we went in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never been of the view that we should be sacrificing American lives to try to establish a democratic government in Afghanistan—a country that has never once in its entire history been a united country, and is made up—and I don’t mean this in a derogatory—made up of different tribes who have never, ever, ever gotten along with one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, as I said before—and this is the last comment I’ll make, but we’ll have more chance to talk about this, unfortunately, beyond, because we’re not out yet—if Osama bin Laden, as well as al Qaeda, had chosen to launch an attack—when they left Saudi Arabia—out of Yemen, would we have ever gone to Afghanistan? Even though the Taliban completely controlled Afghanistan at the time, would we have ever gone?\\r\\n\\r\\nI know it’s not fair to ask you questions. It’s rhetorical. But raise your hand if you think we should have gone and given up thousands of lives and tens of thousands of wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur interest in going was to prevent al Qaeda from reemerging—first to get bin Laden, wipe out al Qaeda in Afghanistan, and prevent that from happening again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I’ve said 100 times: Terrorism has metastasized around the world; we have greater threats coming out of other countries a heck of a lot closer to the United States. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe don’t have military encampments there; we don’t keep people there. We have over-the-horizon capability to keep them from going after us. \\r\\n\\r\\nLadies and gentlemen, it was time to end a 20-year war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you so much.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"August 26, 2021: Statement on Terror Attacks in Afghanistan\"},{\"doc_name\":\"august-31-2021-remarks-ending-war-afghanistan\",\"date\":\"2021-08-31\",\"transcript\":\"THE PRESIDENT: Last night in Kabul, the United States ended 20 years of war in Afghanistan—the longest war in American history. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe completed one of the biggest airlifts in history, with more than 120,000 people evacuated to safety. That number is more than double what most experts thought were possible. No nation—no nation has ever done anything like it in all of history. Only the United States had the capacity and the will and the ability to do it, and we did it today.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extraordinary success of this mission was due to the incredible skill, bravery, and selfless courage of the United States military and our diplomats and intelligence professionals. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor weeks, they risked their lives to get American citizens, Afghans who helped us, citizens of our Allies and partners, and others onboard planes and out of the country. And they did it facing a crush of enormous crowds seeking to leave the country. And they did it knowing ISIS-K terrorists—sworn enemies of the Taliban—were lurking in the midst of those crowds. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd still, the men and women of the United States military, our diplomatic corps, and intelligence professionals did their job and did it well, risking their lives not for professional gains but to serve others; not in a mission of war but in a mission of mercy. Twenty service members were wounded in the service of this mission. Thirteen heroes gave their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was just at Dover Air Force Base for the dignified transfer. We owe them and their families a debt of gratitude we can never repay but we should never, ever, ever forget.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April, I made the decision to end this war. As part of that decision, we set the date of August 31st for American troops to withdraw. The assumption was that more than 300,000 Afghan National Security Forces that we had trained over the past two decades and equipped would be a strong adversary in their civil wars with the Taliban.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat assumption—that the Afghan government would be able to hold on for a period of time beyond military drawdown—turned out not to be accurate.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I still instructed our national security team to prepare for every eventuality—even that one. And that’s what we did. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, we were ready when the Afghan Security Forces—after two decades of fighting for their country and losing thousands of their own—did not hold on as long as anyone expected. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe were ready when they and the people of Afghanistan watched their own government collapse and their president flee amid the corruption and malfeasance, handing over the country to their enemy, the Taliban, and significantly increasing the risk to U.S. personnel and our Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result, to safely extract American citizens before August 31st—as well as embassy personnel, Allies and partners, and those Afghans who had worked with us and fought alongside of us for 20 years—I had authorized 6,000 troops—American troops—to Kabul to help secure the airport.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs General McKenzie said, this is the way the mission was designed. It was designed to operate under severe stress and attack. And that’s what it did.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince March, we reached out 19 times to Americans in Afghanistan, with multiple warnings and offers to help them leave Afghanistan—all the way back as far as March. After we started the evacuation 17 days ago, we did initial outreach and analysis and identified around 5,000 Americans who had decided earlier to stay in Afghanistan but now wanted to leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Operation Allied Rescue [Allies Refuge] ended up getting more than 5,500 Americans out. We got out thousands of citizens and diplomats from those countries that went into Afghanistan with us to get bin Laden. We got out locally employed staff of the United States Embassy and their families, totaling roughly 2,500 people. We got thousands of Afghan translators and interpreters and others, who supported the United States, out as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we believe that about 100 to 200 Americans remain in Afghanistan with some intention to leave. Most of those who remain are dual citizens, long-time residents who had earlier decided to stay because of their family roots in Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bottom line: Ninety [Ninety-eight] percent of Americans in Afghanistan who wanted to leave were able to leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for those remaining Americans, there is no deadline. We remain committed to get them out if they want to come out. Secretary of State Blinken is leading the continued diplomatic efforts to ensure a safe passage for any American, Afghan partner, or foreign national who wants to leave Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, just yesterday, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution that sent a clear message about what the international community expects the Taliban to deliver on moving forward, notably freedom of travel, freedom to leave. And together, we are joined by over 100 countries that are determined to make sure the Taliban upholds those commitments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will include ongoing efforts in Afghanistan to reopen the airport, as well as overland routes, allowing for continued departure to those who want to leave and delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Taliban has made public commitments, broadcast on television and radio across Afghanistan, on safe passage for anyone wanting to leave, including those who worked alongside Americans. We don’t take them by their word alone but by their actions, and we have leverage to make sure those commitments are met.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me be clear: Leaving August the 31st is not due to an arbitrary deadline; it was designed to save American lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy predecessor, the former President, signed an agreement with the Taliban to remove U.S. troops by May the 1st, just months after I was inaugurated. It included no requirement that the Taliban work out a cooperative governing arrangement with the Afghan government, but it did authorize the release of 5,000 prisoners last year, including some of the Taliban’s top war commanders, among those who just took control of Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd by the time I came to office, the Taliban was in its strongest military position since 2001, controlling or contesting nearly half of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous administration’s agreement said that if we stuck to the May 1st deadline that they had signed on to leave by, the Taliban wouldn’t attack any American forces, but if we stayed, all bets were off.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we were left with a simple decision: Either follow through on the commitment made by the last administration and leave Afghanistan, or say we weren’t leaving and commit another tens of thousands more troops going back to war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was the choice—the real choice—between leaving or escalating.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit. The decision to end the military airlift operations at Kabul airport was based on the unanimous recommendation of my civilian and military advisors—the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all the service chiefs, and the commanders in the field.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir recommendation was that the safest way to secure the passage of the remaining Americans and others out of the country was not to continue with 6,000 troops on the ground in harm’s way in Kabul, but rather to get them out through non-military means.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 17 days that we operated in Kabul after the Taliban seized power, we engaged in an around-the-clock effort to provide every American the opportunity to leave. Our State Department was working 24/7 contacting and talking, and in some cases, walking Americans into the airport. \\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, more than 5,500 Americans were airlifted out. And for those who remain, we will make arrangements to get them out if they so choose.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the Afghans, we and our partners have airlifted 100,000 of them. No country in history has done more to airlift out the residents of another country than we have done. We will continue to work to help more people leave the country who are at risk. And we’re far from done.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor now, I urge all Americans to join me in grateful prayer for our troops and diplomats and intelligence officers who carried out this mission of mercy in Kabul and at tremendous risk with such unparalleled results: an airma-—an airlift that evacuated tens of thousands to a network of volunteers and veterans who helped identifies [identify] those needing evacuation, guide them to the airport, and provided them for their support along the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re going to continue to need their help. We need your help. And I’m looking forward to meeting with you. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to everyone who is now offering or who will offer to welcome Afghan allies to their homes around the world, including in America: We thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI take responsibility for the decision. Now, some say we should have started mass evacuations sooner and “Couldn’t this have be done—have been done in a more orderly manner?” I respectfully disagree.\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine if we had begun evacuations in June or July, bringing in thousands of American troops and evacuating more than 120,000 people in the middle of a civil war. There still would have been a rush to the airport, a breakdown in confidence and control of the government, and it still would have been a very difficult and dangerous mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bottom line is: There is no evacuatio-—evacuation from the end of a war that you can run without the kinds of complexities, challenges, and threats we faced. None.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are those who would say we should have stayed indefinitely for years on end. They ask, “Why don’t we just keep doing what we were doing? Why did we have to change anything?” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is: Everything had changed. My predecessor had made a deal with the Taliban. When I came into office, we faced a deadline—May 1. The Taliban onslaught was coming.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe faced one of two choices: Follow the agreement of the previous administration and extend it to have—or extend to more time for people to get out; or send in thousands of more troops and escalate the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those asking for a third decade of war in Afghanistan, I ask: What is the vital national interest? In my view, we only have one: to make sure Afghanistan can never be used again to launch an attack on our homeland.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember why we went to Afghanistan in the first place? Because we were attacked by Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda on September 11th, 2001, and they were based in Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe delivered justice to bin Laden on May 2nd, 2011—over a decade ago. Al Qaeda was decimated.\\r\\n\\r\\nI respectfully suggest you ask yourself this question: If we had been attacked on September 11, 2001, from Yemen instead of Afghanistan, would we have ever gone to war in Afghanistan—even though the Taliban controlled Afghanistan in 2001? I believe the honest answer is “no.” That’s because we had no vital national interest in Afghanistan other than to prevent an attack on America’s homeland and their fr-—our friends. And that’s true today.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe succeeded in what we set out to do in Afghanistan over a decade ago. Then we stayed for another decade. It was time to end this war. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a new world. The terror threat has metastasized across the world, well beyond Afghanistan. We face threats from al-Shabaab in Somalia; al Qaeda affiliates in Syria and the Arabian Peninsula; and ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq, and establishing affiliates across Africa and Asia. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fundamental obligation of a President, in my opinion, is to defend and protect America—not against threats of 2001, but against the threats of 2021 and tomorrow. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat is the guiding principle behind my decisions about Afghanistan. I simply do not believe that the safety and security of America is enhanced by continuing to deploy thousands of American troops and spending billions of dollars a year in Afghanistan. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut I also know that the threat from terrorism continues in its pernicious and evil nature. But it’s changed, expanded to other countries. Our strategy has to change too.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will maintain the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan and other countries. We just don’t need to fight a ground war to do it. We have what’s called over-the-horizon capabilities, which means we can strike terrorists and targets without American boots on the ground—or very few, if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve shown that capacity just in the last week. We struck ISIS-K remotely, days after they murdered 13 of our service members and dozens of innocent Afghans. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to ISIS-K: We are not done with you yet. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs Commander-in-Chief, I firmly believe the best path to guard our safety and our security lies in a tough, unforgiving, targeted, precise strategy that goes after terror where it is today, not where it was two decades ago. That’s what’s in our national interest. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here’s a critical thing to understand: The world is changing. We’re engaged in a serious competition with China. We’re dealing with the challenges on multiple fronts with Russia. We’re confronted with cyberattacks and nuclear proliferation. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have to shore up America’s competitive[ness] to meet these new challenges in the competition for the 21st century. And we can do both: fight terrorism and take on new threats that are here now and will continue to be here in the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there’s nothing China or Russia would rather have, would want more in this competition than the United States to be bogged down another decade in Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we turn the page on the foreign policy that has guided our nat-—our nation the last two decades, we’ve got to learn from our mistakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo me, there are two that are paramount. First, we must set missions with clear, achievable goals—not ones we’ll never reach. And second, we must stay clearly focused on the fundamental national security interest of the United States of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis decision about Afghanistan is not just about Afghanistan. It’s about ending an era of major military operations to remake other countries. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe saw a mission of counterterrorism in Afghanistan—getting the terrorists and stopping attacks—morph into a counterinsurgency, nation building—trying to create a democratic, cohesive, and unified Afghanistan -– something that has never been done over the many centuries of Afghans’ [Afghanistan’s] history. \\r\\n\\r\\nMoving on from that mindset and those kind of large-scale troop deployments will make us stronger and more effective and safer at home. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for anyone who gets the wrong idea, let me say it clearly. To those who wish America harm, to those that engage in terrorism against us and our allies, know this: The United States will never rest. We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down to the ends of the Earth, and we will—you will pay the ultimate price.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let me be clear: We will continue to support the Afghan people through diplomacy, international influence, and humanitarian aid. We’ll continue to push for regional diplomacy and engagement to prevent violence and instability. We’ll continue to speak out for basic rights of the Afghan people, especially women and girls, as we speak out for women and girls all around the globe. And I’ve been clear that human rights will be the center of our foreign policy. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut the way to do that is not through endless military deployments, but through diplomacy, economic tools, and rallying the rest of the world for support.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, the war in Afghanistan is now over. I’m the fourth President who has faced the issue of whether and when to end this war. When I was running for President, I made a commitment to the American people that I would end this war. And today, I’ve honored that commitment. It was time to be honest with the American people again. We no longer had a clear purpose in an open-ended mission in Afghanistan. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 20 years of war in Afghanistan, I refused to send another generation of America’s sons and daughters to fight a war that should have ended long ago. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter more than $2 trillion spent in Afghanistan—a cost that researchers at Brown University estimated would be over $300 million a day for 20 years in Afghanistan—for two decades—yes, the American people should hear this: $300 million a day for two decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you take the number of $1 trillion, as many say, that’s still $150 million a day for two decades. And what have we lost as a consequence in terms of opportunities? I refused to continue in a war that was no longer in the service of the vital national interest of our people. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd most of all, after 800,000 Americans serving in Afghanistan—I’ve traveled that whole country—brave and honorable service; after 20,744 American servicemen and women injured, and the loss of 2,461 American personnel, including 13 lives lost just this week, I refused to open another decade of warfare in Afghanistan. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve been a nation too long at war. If you’re 20 years old today, you have never known an America at peace. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, when I hear that we could’ve, should’ve continued the so-called low-grade effort in Afghanistan, at low risk to our service members, at low cost, I don’t think enough people understand how much we have asked of the 1 percent of this country who put that uniform on, who are willing to put their lives on the line in defense of our nation. \\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe it’s because my deceased son, Beau, served in Iraq for a full year, before that. Well, maybe it’s because of what I’ve seen over the years as senator, vice president, and president traveling these countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of our veterans and their families have gone through hell—deployment after deployment, months and years away from their families; missed birthdays, anniversaries; empty chairs at holidays; financial struggles; divorces; loss of limbs; traumatic brain injury; post-traumatic stress. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe see it in the struggles many have when they come home. We see it in the strain on their families and caregivers. We see it in the strain of their families when they’re not there. We see it in the grief borne by their survivors. The cost of war they will carry with them their whole lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost tragically, we see it in the shocking and stunning statistic that should give pause to anyone who thinks war can ever be low-grade, low-risk, or low-cost: 18 veterans, on average, who die by suicide every single day in America—not in a far-off place, but right here in America. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s nothing low-grade or low-risk or low-cost about any war. It’s time to end the war in Afghanistan. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs we close 20 years of war and strife and pain and sacrifice, it’s time to look to the future, not the past—to a future that’s safer, to a future that’s more secure, to a future that honors those who served and all those who gave what President Lincoln called their “last full measure of devotion.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI give you my word: With all of my heart, I believe this is the right decision, a wise decision, and the best decision for America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you. Thank you. And may God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"August 31, 2021: Remarks on Ending the War in Afghanistan\"},{\"doc_name\":\"february-21-2023-remarks-one-year-anniversary-ukraine-war\",\"date\":\"2023-02-22\",\"transcript\":\"THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, Poland! One of our great allies. President Duda, Prime Minister — Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Mayor, and to all the former ministers and presidents, as well as mayors and Polish political leaders from all across the country: Thank you for welcoming me back to Poland.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, it was nearly one year ago, nearly one year ago I spoke at the Royal Castle here in Warsaw, just weeks after Vladimir Putin had unleashed his murderous assault on Ukraine. The largest land war in Europe since World War Two had begun. And the principles that had been the cornerstone of peace, prosperity, and stability on this planet for more than 75 years were at risk of being shattered.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne year ago, the world was bracing for the fall of Kyiv. Well, I have just come from a visit to Kyiv, and I can report: Kyiv stands strong! Kyiv stands proud. It stands tall. And most important, it stands free.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Russia invaded, it wasn’t just Ukraine being tested. The whole world faced a test for the ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nEurope was being tested. America was being tested. NATO was being tested. All democracies were being tested. And the questions we faced were as simple as they were profound.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould we respond or would we look the other way? Would we be strong or would we be weak? Would be — we would — would we be — all of our allies — would be united or divided?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne year later, we know the answer. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe did respond. We would be strong. We would be united. And the world would not look the other way. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also faced fundamental questions about the commitment to the most basic of principles. Would we stand up for the sovereignty of nations? Would we stand up for the right of people to live free from naked aggression? Would we stand up for democracy?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne year later, we know the answers. \\r\\n\\r\\nYes, we would stand up for sovereignty. And we did. \\r\\n\\r\\nYes, we would stand up for the right of people to live free from aggression. And we did. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we would stand up for democracy. And we did.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yesterday, I had the honor to stand with President Zelenskyy in Kyiv to declare that we will keep standing up for these same things no matter what.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen President Putin ordered his tanks to roll into Ukraine, he thought we would roll over. He was wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ukrainian people are too brave.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica, Europe, a coalition of nations from the Atlantic to the Pacific — we were too unified.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemocracy was too strong.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of an easy victory he perceived and predicted, Putin left with burnt-out tanks and Russia’s forces in delay — in disarray. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought he’d get the Finlandization of NATO. Instead, he got the NATOization of Finland — and Sweden. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought NATO would fracture and divide. Instead, NATO is more united and more unified than ever — than ever before.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought he could weaponize energy to crack your resolve — Europe’s resolve.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, we’re working together to end Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought autocrats like himself were tough and leaders of democracies were soft.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, he met the iron will of America and the nations everywhere that refused to accept a world governed by fear and force.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found himself at war with a nation led by a man whose courage would be forged in fire and steel: President Zelenskyy. \\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Putin — President Putin is confronted with something today that he didn’t think was possible a year ago. The democracies of the world have grown stronger, not weaker. But the autocrats of the world have grown weaker, not stronger.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause in the moments of great upheaval and uncertainty, that knowing what you stand for is most important, and knowing who stands with you makes all the difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people of Poland know that. You know that. In fact, you know — you know it better than anyone here in Poland. Because that’s what solidarity means.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough partition and oppression, when the beautiful city was destroyed after the Warsaw Uprising, during decades under the iron fist of communist rule, Poland endured because you stood together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s how the brave leaders of the opposition and the people of Belarus continue to fight for their democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s how the resolve of Moldovan people — (applause) — resolve of the people of Moldova to live in freedom gained them independence and put them on the path to EU membership.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Sandu is here today. I’m not sure where she is. But I’m proud to stand with you and the freedom-loving people of Moldova. Give her a round of applause.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne year into this war, Putin no longer doubts the strength of our coalition. But he still doubts our conviction. He doubts our staying power. He doubts our continued support for Ukraine. He doubts whether NATO can remain unified.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there should be no doubt: Our support for Ukraine will not waver, NATO will not be divided, and we will not tire. \\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Putin’s craven lust for land and power will fail. And the Ukrainian people’s love for their country will prevail.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemocracies of the world will stand guard over freedom today, tomorrow, and forever. For that’s what — that’s what’s at stake here: freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s the message I carried to Kyiv yesterday, directly to the people of Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen President Zelenskyy said — he came to the United States in December — quote — he said this struggle will define the world and what our children and grandchildren — how they live, and then their children and grandchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wasn’t only speaking about the children and grandchildren of Ukraine. He was speaking about all of our children and grandchildren. Yours and mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re seeing again today what the people of Poland and the people all across Europe saw for decades: Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutocrats only understand one word: “No.”  “No.”  “No.” \\r\\n\\r\\n“No, you will not take my country.” “No, you will not take my freedom.” “No, you will not take my future.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I’ll repeat tonight what I said last year in this same place: A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never be able to erase the people’s love of liberty. Brutality will never grind down the will of the free. And Ukraine — Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia. Never. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, this has been an extraordinary year in every sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nExtraordinary brutality from Russian forces and mercenaries. They have committed depravities, crimes against humanity, without shame or compunction. They’ve targeted civilians with death and destruction. Used rape as a weapon of war. Stolen Ukrainian children in an attempt to — in an attempt to steal Ukraine’s future. Bombed train stations, maternity hospitals, schools, and orphanages.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one — no one can turn away their eyes from the atrocities Russia is committing against the Ukrainian people. It’s abhorrent. It’s abhorrent.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut extraordinarily, as well, has been the response of the Ukrainian people and the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne year after the bombs began to fall and Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Ukraine is still independent and free.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Kherson to Kharkiv, Ukrainian fighters have reclaimed their land.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn more than 50 percent of the territory Russia held last year, the blue and the yellow flag of Ukraine proudly waves once again.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Zelenskyy still leads a democratically elected government that represents the will of the Ukrainian people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the world has already voted multiple times, including in the United Nations General Assembly, to condemn Russia’s aggression and support a just peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach time in the U.N., that vote has been overwhelming.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October, 143 nations in the United Nations condemned Russia’s illegal annexation. Only four — four in the entire U.N. — voted with Russia. Four.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, tonight, I speak once more to the people of Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States and the nations of Europe do not seek to control or destroy Russia. The West was not plotting to attack Russia, as Putin said today. And millions of Russian citizens who only want to live in peace with their neighbors are not the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis war was never a necessity; it’s a tragedy.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Putin chose this war. Every day the war continues is his choice. He could end the war with a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s simple. If Russia stopped invading Ukraine, it would end the war. If Ukraine stopped defending itself against Russia, it would be the end of Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why, together, we’re making sure Ukraine can defend itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States has assembled a worldwide coalition of more than 50 nations to get critical weapons and supplies to the brave Ukrainian fighters on the frontlines. Air defense systems, artillery, ammunition, tanks, and armored vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Union and its member states have stepped up with unprecedented commitment to Ukraine, not just in security assistance, but economic, and humanitarian, refugee assistance, and so much more. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo all of you here tonight: Take a moment. And I’m serious when I say this: Turn on and look — turn around and look at one another. Look at what you’ve done so far.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoland is hosting more than 1.5 million refugees from this war. God bless you.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPoland’s generosity, your willingness to open your hearts and your homes, is extraordinary.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the American people are united in our resolve as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll across my country, in big cities and small towns, Ukrainian flags fly from American homes. \\r\\n\\r\\nOver the past year, Democrats and Republicans in our United States Congress have come together to stand for freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s who Americans are, and that’s what Americans do. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe world is also coming together to address the global fallout from President Putin’s war.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutin tried to starve the world, blocking the ports in the Black Sea to stop Ukraine from exporting its grain, exacerbating the global food crisis that hit developing nations in Africa especially hard.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, the United States and the G7 and partners around the world answered the call with historic commitments to address the crisis and to bolster global food supplies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this week, my wife, Jill Biden, is traveling to Africa to help bring attention to this critical issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur commitment is to the people of Ukraine and the future of Ukraine — a Ukraine that’s free, sovereign, and democratic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was the dream of those who declared Ukraine’s independence more than 30 years ago — who led the Orange Revolution and the Revolution of Dignity; who braved ice and fire on the Maidan and the Heavenly Hundred who died there; and those who continue still to root out Kremlin’s efforts to corrupt, coerce, and control.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a dream for those Ukrainian patriots who have fought for years against Russia’s aggressions in the Donbas and the heroes who have given everything, given their lives, in the service of their beloved Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was honored to visit their memorial in Kyiv yesterday to pay tribute to the sacrifice of those who lost their lives, standing alongside President Zelenskyy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States and our partners stand with Ukraine’s teachers, its hospital staff, its emergency responders, the workers in cities across Ukraine who are fighting to keep the power on in the face of Russia’s cruel bombardment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stand with the millions of refugees of this war who have found a welcome in Europe and the United States, particularly here in Poland.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrdinary people all across Europe did whatever they could to help and continue to do so. Polish businesses, civil society, cultural leaders — including the First Lady of Poland, who is here tonight — have led with the heart and determination, showcasing all that’s good about the human spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadam First Lady, we love you.  Thank you all. \\r\\n\\r\\nI’ll never forget, last year, visiting with refugees from Ukraine who had just arrived in Warsaw, seeing their faces exhausted and afraid — holding their children so close, worrying they might never see their fathers, their husbands, their brothers or sisters again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that darkest moment of their lives, you, the people of Poland, offered them safety and light. You embraced them. You literally embraced them. I watched. I watched the looks on their faces. \\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, together we have made sure that Russia is paying the price for its abuses.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe continue to maintain the largest sanctions regime ever imposed on any country in history. And we’re going to announce more sanctions this week together with our partners.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll hold accountable those who are responsible for this war. And we will seek justice for the war crimes and crimes against humanity continuing to be committed by the Russians.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, there is much for us to be proud of over the — all that we have achieved together this past year. But we have to be honest and cleared-eyed as we look at the year ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe defense of freedom is not the work of a day or of a year. It’s always difficult. It’s always important.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Ukraine continues to defend itself against the Russian onslaught and launch counter-offensives of its own, there will continue to be hard and very bitter days, victories and tragedies. But Ukraine is steeled for the fight ahead. And the United States, together with our Allies and partners, are going to continue to have Ukraine’s back as it defends itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext year, I will host every member of NATO for our 2024 summit in the United States. Together, we’ll celebrate the 75th anniversary of the strongest defensive alliance in the history of the world — NATO. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let there be no doubt, the commitment of the United States to our NATO Alliance and Article 5 is rock solid. And every member of NATO knows it. And Russia knows it as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn attack against one is an attack against all. It’s a sacred oath. A sacred oath to defend every inch of NATO territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the past year, the United States has come together with our Allies and partners in an extraordinary coalition to stand against Russian aggression.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the work in front of us is not just what we’re against, it’s about what we’re for. What kind of world do we want to build?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need to take the strength and capacity of this coalition and apply it to lifting up — lifting up the lives of people everywhere, improving health, growing prosperity, preserving the planet, building peace and security, treating everyone with dignity and respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s our responsibility. The democracies of the world have to deliver it for our people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we gather tonight, the world, in my view, is at an — at an inflection point. The decisions we make over the next five years or so are going to determine and shape our lives for decades to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s true for Americans. It’s true for the people of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd while decisions are ours to make now, the principles and the stakes are eternal. A choice between chaos and stability. Between building and destroying. Between hope and fear. Between democracy that lifts up the human spirit and the brutal hand of the dictator who crushes it. Between nothing less than limitation and possibilities, the kind of possibilities that come when people who live not in captivity but in freedom. Freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreedom. There is no sweeter word than freedom. There is no nobler goal than freedom. There is no higher aspiration than freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmericans know that, and you know it. And all that we do now must be done so our children and grandchildren will know it as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enemy of the tyrant and the hope of the brave and the truth of the ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nStand with us. We will stand with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us move forward with faith and conviction and with an abiding commitment to be allies not of darkness, but of light. Not of oppression, but of liberation. Not of captivity, but, yes, of freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay God bless you all. May God protect our troops. And may God bless the heroes of Ukraine and all those who defend freedom around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, Poland. Thank you, thank you, thank you for what you’re doing. God bless you all.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"February 21, 2023: Remarks on the One-Year Anniversary of the Ukraine War\"},{\"doc_name\":\"february-24-2022-remarks-russian-invasion-ukraine\",\"date\":\"2022-02-24\",\"transcript\":\"THE PRESIDENT: Sorry to keep you waiting. Good afternoon. The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a premeditated attack. Vladimir Putin has been planning this for months, as I’ve been—as we’ve been saying all along. He moved more than 175,000 troops, military equipment into positions along the Ukrainian border.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved blood supplies into position and built a field hospital, which tells you all you need to know about his intentions all along.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rejected every good-faith effort the United States and our Allies and partners made to address our mutual security concerns through dialogue to avoid needless conflict and avert human suffering.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor weeks—for weeks, we have been warning that this would happen. And now it’s unfolding largely as we predicted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past week, we’ve seen shelling increase in the Donbas, the region in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists.\\r\\n\\r\\nRus-—the Russian government has perpetrated cyberattacks against Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe saw a staged political theater in Moscow—outlandish and baseless claims that Ukraine was—Ukraine was about to invade and launch a war against Russia, that Ukraine was prepared to use chemical weapons, that Ukraine committed a genocide—without any evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe saw a flagrant violation of international law in attempting to unilaterally create two new so-called republics on sovereign Ukrainian territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd at the very moment that the United Nations Security Council was meeting to stand up for Ukraine’s sovereignty to stave off invasion, Putin declared his war.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin moments—moments, missile strikes began to fall on historic cities across Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came in the air raids, followed by tanks and troops rolling in.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve been transparent with the world. We’ve shared declassified evidence about Russia’s plans and cyberattacks and false pretexts so that there can be no confusion or cover-up about what Putin was doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, I’m authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is going to impose severe costs on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have purposefully designed these sanctions to maximize the long-term impact on Russia and to minimize the impact on the United States and our Allies. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I want to be clear: The United States is not doing this alone. For months, we’ve been building a coalition of partners representing well more than half of the global economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty-seven members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy—as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and many others—to amplify the joint impact of our response.\\r\\n\\r\\nI just spoke with the G7 leaders this morning, and we are in full and total agreement. We will limit Russia’s ability to do business in Dollars, Euros, Pounds, and Yen to be part of the global economy. We will limit their ability to do that. We are going to stunt the ability to finance and grow Rus-—the Russian military.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re going to impose major—and we’re going to impair their ability to compete in a high-tech 21st century economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve already seen the impact of our actions on Russia’s currency, the Ruble, which early today hit its weakest level ever—ever in history. And the Russian stock market plunged today. The Russian government’s borrowing rate spiked by over 15 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn today’s actions, we have now sanctioned Russian banks that together hold around $1 trillion in assets.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve cut off Russia’s largest bank—a bank that holds more than one third of Russia’s banking assets by itself—cut it off from the US financial system. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd today, we’re also blocking four more major banks. That means every asset they have in America will be frozen. This includes V.T.B., the second-largest bank in Russia, which has $250 billion in assets.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs promised, we’re also adding names to the list of Russian elites and their family members that are sanctioning—that we’re sanctioning as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I said on Tuesday, these are people who personally gain from the Kremlin’s policies and they should share in the pain. We will keep up this drumbeat of those designations against corrupt billionaires in the days ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday, we stopped the Russian government from raising money from US or European investors.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, we’re going to apply the same restrictions to Russia’s largest state-owned enterprises—companies with assets that exceed $1.4 trillion.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the most powerful impacts of our actions will come over time as we squeeze Russia’s access to finance and technology for strategic sectors of its economy and degrade its industrial capacity for years to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween our actions and those of our Allies and partners, we estimate that we’ll cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military. It’ll degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program. It will hurt their ability to build ships, reducing their ability to compete economically. And it will be a major hit to Putin’s long-term strategic ambitions. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’re preparing to do more. In addition to the economic penalties we’re imposing, we’re also taking steps to defend our NATO Allies, particularly in the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nTomorrow, NATO will convene a summit—we’ll be there—to bring together the leaders of 30 Allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO Alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough we provided over $650 million in defensive assistance to Ukraine just this year—this last year, let me say it again: Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies and reassure those Allies in the east.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power. And the good news is: NATO is more united and more determined than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no doubt—no doubt that the United States and every NATO Ally will meet our Article 5 commitments, which says that an attack on one is an attack on all.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the past few weeks, I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to NATO.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday, in response to Russia’s aggressive action, including its troop presence in Belarus and the Black Sea, I’ve authorized the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATO’s eastern flank Allies: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Allies have also been stepping up, adding—the other Allies, the rest of NATO—adding their own forces and capabilities to ensure our collective defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd today, within hours of Russia’s unleashing its assault, NATO came together and authorized and activated—an activation of response plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will enable NATO’s high-readiness forces to deploy and—when and where they’re needed to protect our NATO Allies on the eastern boundaries of Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now I’m authorizing additional US forces and capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO’s response, including some of US-based forces that the Department of Defense placed on standby weeks ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve also spoken with Defense Secretary Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, about preparations for additional moves should they become necessary to protect our NATO Allies and support the greatest military Alliance in the history of the world—NATO.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we respond, my administration is using the tools—every tool at our disposal to protect American families and businesses from rising prices at the gas pump.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, we’re taking active steps to bring down the costs. And American oil and gas companies should not—should not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, in our sanctions package, we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption. We have been coordinating with major oil producing and consuming countries toward our common interest to secure global energy supplies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are actively working with countries around the world to elevate [evaluate] a collective release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves of major energy-consuming countries. And the United States will release additional barrels of oil as conditions warrant.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know this is hard and that Americans are already hurting. I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom. This is who we are.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me also repeat the warning I made last week: If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor months, we have been working closely with our private—with the private sector to harden their cyber defenses, sharpen our ability to respond to Russian cyberattacks as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI spoke late last night to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I assured him that the United States, together with our Allies and partners in Europe, will support the Ukrainian people as they defend their country. We’ll provide humanitarian relief to ease their suffering.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in the early days of this conflict, Russian propaganda outlets will keep trying to hide the truth and claim success for its military operation against a made-up threat.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut history has shown time and again how swift gains in territory eventually give way to grinding occupations, acts of mass civil—mass civil disobedience, and strategic dead-ends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next few weeks and months will be hard on the people of Ukraine. Putin has unleashed a great pain on them. But the Ukrainian people have known 30 years of independence, and they have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a dangerous moment for all of Europe, for the freedom around the world. Putin has a—has committed an assault on the very principles that uphold global peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin—and his Kremlin allies are really all about. This was never about genuine security concerns on their part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin’s desire for empire by any means necessary—by bullying Russia’s neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force, and, ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutin’s actions betray his sinister vision for the future of our world—one where nations take what they want by force.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is a vision that the United States and freedom-loving nations everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable power.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States and our Allies and partners will emerge from this stronger, more united, more determined, and more purposeful.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly—economically and strategically. We will make sure of that. Putin will be a pariah on the international stage. Any nation that countenances Russia’s naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by association.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the history of this era is written, Putin’s choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiberty, democracy, human dignity—these are the forces far more powerful than fear and oppression. They cannot be extinguished by tyrants like Putin and his armies. They cannot be erased by people—from people’s hearts and hopes by any amount of violence and intimidation. They endure. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in the contest between democracy and autocracy, between sovereignty and subjugation, make no mistake: Freedom will prevail.\\r\\n\\r\\nGod bless the people of a free and democratic Ukraine. And may God protect our troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: President Biden —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Associated Press, Zeke.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Chris Megerian. So, do you have any plans to speak with President Putin at this point? And what interactions have you had with the Russian government?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I heard the first part: Do I have any plans to speak with Putin at this point. And what?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: What communications have you had with the Kremlin as far as military (inaudible) in Ukraine and making sure this does not spiral into a larger conflict?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, it’s a large conflict already. The way we’re going to assure it’s not going to spiral to a larger conflict is by providing all the forces needed in the Eastern European nations that are members of NATO. NATO is more united than it’s ever been. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I have no plans to talk with Putin. \\r\\n\\r\\nWall Street Journal, Tarina [Tarini].\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, you didn’t mention SWIFT in your sanctions that you announced. Is there a reason why the US isn’t doing that? Is there disagreement among Allies regarding SWIFT and whether Russia should be allowed to be a part of it?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: The sanctions that we have proposed on all their banks is of equal consequence—maybe more consequence than SWIFT—number one. \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber two, it is always an option. But right now, that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take. \\r\\n\\r\\nCecilia Ve-—Vega, ABC. \\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Thank you, sir. Sir, sanctions clearly have not been enough to deter Vladimir Putin to this point. What is going to stop him? How and when does this end? And do you see him trying to go beyond Ukraine?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd a second question I’ll just give to you now: This statement that he gave last night will—that the We-—the threat that he gave—the West “will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history.” Is he threatening a nuclear strike?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I have no idea what he’s threatening. I know what he has done, number one. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd number two, no one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening. That has to sh-—this is going to take time. And we have to show resolve so he knows what’s coming and so the people of Russia know what he’s brought on them. That’s what this is all about. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is going to take time. It’s not going to occur—he’s going to say, “Oh my God, these sanctions are coming. I’m going to stand down.” \\r\\n\\r\\nHe’s going to test the resolve of the West to see if we stay together. And we will. We will and it will impose significant costs on him. \\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Will he go beyond Ukraine, sir? Do you see him going beyond Ukraine?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President—Mr. President —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Points to reporter.) Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Thank you. Two topics, just really quick. First, markets are down and gas prices are up. I know you always stress the difference between Wall Street and Main Street, but everybody seems to be in for some economic pain. How economically painful is it going to get for people in this country?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I do have one more question. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: First of all, there’s no doubt that when a major nuclear power attacks and invades another country that the world is going to respond and markets are going to respond all over the world. So, there’s no doubt about that, number one.\\r\\n\\r\\nNumber two, the notion that this is going to last for a long time is highly unlikely, as long as we continue to stay resolved in imposing the sanctions we’re going to impose on Russia, period. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat’s your next question? I’m sorry.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: The next question is: Did you underestimate Putin? And would you still describe him the way that you did in the summer, as a “worthy adversary”?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: At the time, he was—I made it clear he was an adversary, and I said he was “worthy.” I didn’t underestimate him. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I’ve read most of everything he’s written. Did you read the—I shouldn’t sa-—I’m not being a wise guy. The—you heard the speech he made—almost an hour’s worth of speeches—why he was going into Ukraine. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe has much larger ambitions in Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is about. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I think that his—his ambitions are—are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: President Biden—President Biden —\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: And—and with that—with his ambitions, you’re confident that these devastating sanctions are going to be as devastating as Russian missiles and bullets and tanks?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes. Russian bullets, missiles, and tanks in Ukraine. Yes, I am.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Thank you, President Biden. If sanctions cannot stop President Putin, what penalty can?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I didn’t say sanctions couldn’t stop him.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: But you’ve been talking about the threat of these sanctions for several weeks now —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes, but the threat of the sanctions and imposing the sanctions and seeing the effect of the sanctions are two different things.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Okay, but —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: They’re two different things. And we’re now going to—he’s going to begin to see the effect of the sanctions.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: And what will that do—how will that change his mindset here, given he’s attacking Ukraine as we speak?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Because it will so weaken his country that he’ll have to make a very, very difficult choices of whether to continue to move toward being a second-rate power or, in fact, respond.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: You said, in recent weeks, that big nations cannot bluff when it comes to something like this. You recently said that the idea of personally sanctioning President Putin was on the table. Is that a step that you’re prepared to take? And if not —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: It’s not a bluff; it’s on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Sanctioning President Putin?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Why not sanction him today, sir? Why not sanction him today, sir?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President —\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, if I can, you detailed some severe and swift new sanctions today and said the impact it will have over time, but given the full-scale invasion, given that you’re not pursuing disconnecting Russia from what’s called “SWIFT”—the international banking system—or other sanctions at your disposal, respectfully, sir, what more are you waiting for?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Specifically, the sanctions we’ve imposed exceed SWIFT. The sanctions we imposed exceed anything that’s ever been done. The sanctions we imposed have generated two thirds of the world joining us. They are profound sanctions. Let’s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they’re working.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Let me ask you about—can I ask you about Zelenskyy? Sir, you spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday, sir, if I could follow up —\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: What’s the risk that we are watching the beginning of another Cold War? And is there now a complete rupture in US and Russian relations?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: There is a complete rupture right now in US-Russian relations if they continue on this path that they’re on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in terms of a Cold War, that depends. You have the vast majority of the rest of the world in total opposition to what he’s doing—from Asia to South America to Europe to acr-—around the world. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, it’s going to be a cold day for Russia. The idea—you don’t see a whole lot of people coming to his defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: And are you—are you—if I could follow-up, sir. Are you urging China to help isolate Russia? Are you urging China to help isolate Russia?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I’m not prepared to comment on that at the moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Wait. No, no. (Points to reporter.) Yeah.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, no, no. He’s had his hand up a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. How concerned are you that Putin wants to go beyond Ukraine into other countries and the US will have to get involved if he moves into NATO countries?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, if he did move into NATO countries, he will be involved—we will be involved. The only thing that I’m convinced of is: If we don’t stop now, he’ll be emboldened. If we don’t move against him now with these significant sanctions, he will be emboldened.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, you know, every—well, anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: And can you talk anything more about your conversation —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I’m sorry, I can’t hear you.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Sir, India, which is a major defense partner of the United States—is India with—fully with you on the issue of Ukraine and Russia?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Does the Defense Department of the United States —\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Sir, India is one of your major defense partners. Is India fully in sync with United States on Russia?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: We’re going to be—we’re in consultation with—with India today. We haven’t resolved that completely.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: One more question —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you all very much. Thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"February 24, 2022: Remarks on the Russian Invasion of Ukraine\"},{\"doc_name\":\"february-7-2023-state-union-address\",\"date\":\"2023-02-08\",\"transcript\":\"Mr. Speaker. Madam Vice President. Our First Lady and Second Gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of Congress and the Cabinet. Leaders of our military.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd you, my fellow Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nI start tonight by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Speaker, I look forward to working together.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats and the first Black House Minority Leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries.\\r\\n\\r\\nCongratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history, Mitch McConnell.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority Leader, this time with an even bigger majority.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country, Nancy Pelosi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.\\r\\n\\r\\nA story that is unique among all nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is what we are doing again.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years ago, our economy was reeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, COVID no longer controls our lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, we’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to go it alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.\\r\\n\\r\\nCame together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nCame together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building bridges to connect our nation and people.\\r\\n\\r\\nCame together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that’s always been my vision for our country. To restore the soul of the nation. To rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class. To unite the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve been sent here to finish the job.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor decades, the middle class was hollowed out.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd along the way, something else was lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nPride. That sense of self-worth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey—it’s going to be OK,” and mean it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, let’s look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing again?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, thanks to all we’ve done, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nInflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin’s war that disrupted energy and food supplies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we’re better positioned than any country on Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak.\\r\\n\\r\\nFood inflation is coming down.\\r\\n\\r\\nInflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start a new small business.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery time somebody starts a small business, it’s an act of hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enacted.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanding here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nSemiconductors, the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphones to automobiles, and so much more. These chips were invented right here in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica used to make nearly 40% of the world’s chips.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the last few decades, we lost our edge and we’re down to producing only 10%. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories overseas shut down.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday’s automobiles need up to 3,000 chips each, but American automakers couldn’t make enough cars because there weren’t enough chips.\\r\\n\\r\\nCar prices went up. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can never let that happen again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re making sure the supply chain for America begins in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs even without this law.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this new law, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two years.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres – a literal field of dreams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’ll create 10,000 jobs. 7,000 construction jobs. 3,000 jobs once the factories are finished.\\r\\n\\r\\nJobs paying $130,000 a year, and many don’t require a college degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nJobs where people don’t have to leave home in search of opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it’s just getting started.\\r\\n\\r\\nThink about the new homes, new small businesses, and so much more that will come to life.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they’ll tell you what this means to their communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartland.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we also need the best infrastructure in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe used to be #1 in the world in infrastructure, then we fell to #13th.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we’re coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready, we’ve funded over 20,000 projects, including at major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, ports and airports, clean water, and high-speed internet across America.\\r\\n\\r\\nUrban. Suburban. Rural. Tribal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’re just getting started. I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don’t worry.\\r\\n\\r\\nI promised to be the president for all Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll fund your projects. And I’ll see you at the ground-breaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis law will help further unite all of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor projects like the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio over the Ohio River. Built 60 years ago. Badly in need of repairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the nation’s most congested freight routes carrying $2 billion worth of freight every day. Folks have been talking about fixing it for decades, but we’re finally going to get it done.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went there last month with Democrats and Republicans from both states to deliver $1.6 billion for this project.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I was there, I met an ironworker named Sara, who is here tonight.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 30 years, she’s been a proud member of Ironworkers Local 44, known as the “cowboys of the sky” who built the Cincinnati skyline.\\r\\n\\r\\nSara said she can’t wait to be ten stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge. That’s pride.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s what we’re also building—Pride.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers, so every child in America can drink clean water.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re making sure that every community has access to affordable, high-speed internet.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo parent should have to drive to a McDonald’s parking lot so their kid can do their homework online.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when we do these projects, we’re going to Buy American.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuy American has been the law of the land since 1933. But for too long, past administrations have found ways to get around it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I’m also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe that’s you, watching at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.\\r\\n\\r\\nI get it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nJobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, too many of you lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering what will happen if your spouse gets cancer, your child gets sick, or if something happens to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill you have the money to pay your medical bills? Will you have to sell the house?\\r\\n\\r\\nI get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we’re taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, one in ten Americans has diabetes.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive. Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars—and making record profits.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s finish the job this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year when there are in fact many drugs, like expensive cancer drugs, that can cost up to $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000 a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies will have to pay Medicare back the difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’re finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn’t just save seniors money.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will cut the federal deficit, saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars on the prescription drugs the government buys for Medicare.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy wouldn’t we want to do that?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\\r\\n\\r\\nMake no mistake, if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever in history.\\r\\n\\r\\nA record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to the law I signed last year, millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the way that law was written, that benefit expires after 2025.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s finish the job, make those savings permanent, and expand coverage to those left off Medicaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nLowering utility bills, creating American jobs, and leading the world to a clean energy future.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve visited the devastating aftermaths of record floods and droughts, storms, and wildfires.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we are rebuilding for the long term.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew electric grids able to weather the next major storm.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoads and water systems to withstand the next big flood.\\r\\n\\r\\nClean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities too often left behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re building 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistoric conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s face reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe climate crisis doesn’t care if your state is red or blue. It is an existential threat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to confront it. I’m proud of how America is at last stepping up to the challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there’s so much more to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will finish the job.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m a capitalist. But just pay your fair share.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I think a lot of you at home agree with me that our present tax system is simply unfair.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea that in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s simply not fair.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15%.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust 15%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s less than a nurse pays. Let me be clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody. Not one penny.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there’s more to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s finish the job. Reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for a billionaire minimum tax.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may have noticed that Big Oil just reported record profits.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s outrageous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporations ought to do the right thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why I propose that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage long term investments instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will still make a considerable profit.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of cutting the number of audits of wealthy tax payers, I signed a law that will reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s being fiscally responsible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last two years, my administration cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion—the largest deficit reduction in American history.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a row.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly 25% of the entire national debt, a debt that took 200 years to accumulate, was added by that administration alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow did Congress respond to all that debt?\\r\\n\\r\\nThey lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey paid America’s bills to prevent economic disaster for our country.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I’m asking this Congress to follow suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what their plans are.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat means if Congress doesn’t vote to keep them, those programs will go away.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Republicans say if we don’t cut Social Security and Medicare, they’ll let America default on its debt for the first time in our history.\\r\\n\\r\\nI won’t let that happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmericans have been paying into them with every single paycheck since they started working.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo tonight, let’s all agree to stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security. We will not cut Medicare.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose benefits belong to the American people. They earned them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will not allow them to be taken away.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext month when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to offer their plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can sit down together and discuss both plans together.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy plan will lower the deficit by $2 trillion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI won’t cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, I will extend the Medicare Trust Fund by at least two decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. And I will pay for the ideas I’ve talked about tonight by making the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, here’s the deal. Big corporations aren’t just taking advantage of the tax code. They’re taking advantage of you, the American consumer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere’s my message to all of you out there: I have your back. We’re already preventing insurance companies from sending surprise medical bills, stopping 1 million surprise bills a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re protecting seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.\\r\\n\\r\\nMillions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get hearing aids over-the-counter without a prescription.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapitalism without competition is not capitalism. It is exploitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast year I cracked down on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for everyday goods coming into our country.\\r\\n\\r\\nI signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90%, helping American farmers, businesses, and consumers.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s finish the job.\\r\\n\\r\\nPass bipartisan legislation to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy administration is also taking on “junk” fees, those hidden surcharges too many businesses use to make you pay more.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, we’re making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront and refund your money if your flight is cancelled or delayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve reduced exorbitant bank overdraft fees, saving consumers more than $1 billion a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re cutting credit card late fees by 75%, from $30 to $8.\\r\\n\\r\\nJunk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey make it harder for you to pay the bills or afford that family trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve written a bill to stop all that. It’s called the Junk Fee Prevention Act.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll ban surprise “resort fees” that hotels tack on to your bill. These fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that aren’t even resorts.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll make cable internet and cellphone companies stop charging you up to $200 or more when you decide to switch to another provider.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll cap service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all fees upfront.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’ll prohibit airlines from charging up to $50 roundtrip for families just to sit together.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaggage fees are bad enough—they can’t just treat your child like a piece of luggage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmericans are tired of being played for suckers.\\r\\n\\r\\nPass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor too long, workers have been getting stiffed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re beginning to restore the dignity of work.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, 30 million workers had to sign non-compete agreements when they took a job. So a cashier at a burger place can’t cross the street to take the same job at another burger place to make a couple bucks more.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they’re worth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPass the PRO Act because workers have a right to form a union. And let’s guarantee all workers a living wage.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s also make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, and affordable child care that will enable millions more people to go to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s also restore the full Child Tax Credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity. We increase economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s also finish the job and get more families access to affordable and quality housing.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. And give a little more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nPass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care services they need and support the workers who are doing God’s work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese plans are fully paid for and we can afford to do them.\\r\\n\\r\\nRestoring the dignity of work also means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the world has caught up.\\r\\n\\r\\nJill, who teaches full-time, has an expression: “Any nation that out-educates us will out-compete us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFolks, you all know 12 years is not enough to win the economic competition for the 21st Century.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want America to have the best-educated workforce, let’s finish the job by providing access to pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies show that children who go to pre-school are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree, no matter their background.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s give public school teachers a raise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’re making progress by reducing student debt and increasing Pell Grants for working- and middle-class families.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s finish the job, connect students to career opportunities starting in high school and provide two years of community college, some of the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a four-year degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis when schools were closed, let’s also recognize how far we’ve come in the fight against the pandemic itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people, we have broken COVID’s grip on us.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID deaths are down nearly 90%.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve saved millions of lives and opened our country back up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd soon we’ll end the public health emergency.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we will remember the toll and pain that will never go away for so many. More than 1 million Americans have lost their lives to COVID.\\r\\n\\r\\nFamilies grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe remember them, and we remain vigilant.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as we emerge from this crisis stronger, I’m also doubling down on prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat during the pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I came to office many inspector generals who protect taxpayer dollars were sidelined. Fraud was rampant.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then, we’ve recovered billions of taxpayer dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, let’s triple our anti-fraud strike forces going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars from the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor every dollar we put into fighting fraud, taxpayers get back at least ten times as much.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID left other scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have an obligation to make sure all our people are safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic safety depends on public trust. But too often that trust is violated.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols, who had to bury him just last week. There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut imagine what it’s like to lose a child at the hands of the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve never had to have the talk with my children—Beau, Hunter, and Ashley—that so many Black and Brown families have had with their children.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a police officer pulls you over, turn on your interior lights. Don’t reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel.\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine having to worry like that every day in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere’s what Tyre’s mom shared with me when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith faith in God, she said her son “was a beautiful soul and something good will come from this.”\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine how much courage and character that takes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s up to us. It’s up to all of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all want the same thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeighborhoods free of violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaw enforcement who earn the community’s trust.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur children to come home safely.\\r\\n\\r\\nEqual protection under the law; that’s the covenant we have with each other in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we know police officers put their lives on the line every day, and we ask them to do too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be counselors, social workers, psychologists; responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises, and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe ask too much of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know most cops are good, decent people. They risk their lives every time they put on that shield.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have to do better.\\r\\n\\r\\nGive law enforcement the training they need, hold them to higher standards, and help them succeed in keeping everyone safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also need more first responders and other professionals to address growing mental health and substance abuse challenges.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime; more community intervention programs; more investments in housing, education, and job training.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this can help prevent violence in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when police officers or departments violate the public’s trust, we must hold them accountable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law enforcement, I signed an executive order for all federal officers banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the George Floyd Act.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s commit ourselves to make the words of Tyre’s mother come true, something good must come from this.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of us in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can’t turn away.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s do what we know in our hearts we need to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s come together and finish the job on police reform.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo something.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was the same plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde: Do something on gun violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank God we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat includes things that the majority of responsible gun owners support, like enhanced background checks for 18 to 21-year-olds and red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we know our work is not done.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrandon put off his college dreams to stay by his mom’s side as she was dying from cancer. He now works at a dance studio started by his grandparents.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo weeks ago, during Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio’s front door close and saw a man pointing a gun at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought he was going to die, but then he thought about the people inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance studio.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nBan assault weapons once and for all.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did it before. I led the fight to ban them in 1994.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s finish the job and ban assault weapons again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let’s also come together on immigration and make it a bipartisan issue like it was before.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince we launched our new border plan last month, unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut America’s border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you won’t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere in the people’s House, it’s our duty to protect all the people’s rights and freedoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress must restore the right the Supreme Court took away last year and codify Roe v. Wade to protect every woman’s constitutional right to choose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vice President and I are doing everything we can to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient privacy. But already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans.\\r\\n\\r\\nMake no mistake; if Congress passes a national abortion ban, I will veto it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example. Let’s remember the world is watching.\\r\\n\\r\\nI spoke from this chamber one year ago, just days after Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal war against Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nA murderous assault, evoking images of the death and destruction Europe suffered in World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutin’s invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America. A test for the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould we stand for the most basic of principles?\\r\\n\\r\\nWould we stand for sovereignty?\\r\\n\\r\\nWould we stand for the right of people to live free from tyranny?\\r\\n\\r\\nWould we stand for the defense of democracy?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor such a defense matters to us because it keeps the peace and prevents open season for would-be aggressors to threaten our security and prosperity. One year later, we know the answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, we would.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yes, we did.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether, we did what America always does at our best.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe led.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe united NATO and built a global coalition.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stood against Putin’s aggression.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stood with the Ukrainian people.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, we are once again joined by Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States. She represents not just her nation, but the courage of her people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmbassador, America is united in our support for your country. We will stand with you as long as it takes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur nation is working for more freedom, more dignity, and more peace, not just in Europe, but everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I came to office, the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was falling in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, and that China’s government is intent on dominating.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvesting in our alliances and working with our allies to protect our advanced technologies so they’re not used against us.\\r\\n\\r\\nModernizing our military to safeguard stability and deter aggression.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, we’re in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China’s threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let’s be clear: winning the competition with China should unite all of us. We face serious challenges across the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica is rallying the world again to meet those challenges, from climate and global health, to food insecurity, to terrorism and territorial aggression.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllies are stepping up, spending more and doing more.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd bridges are forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic. And those who bet against America are learning just how wrong they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s never a good bet to bet against America.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came to office, most everyone assumed bipartisanship was impossible. But I never believed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why a year ago, I offered a Unity Agenda for the nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve made real progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether, we passed a law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassed a gun safety law making historic investments in mental health.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaunched ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and so much more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named for the late Iraq war veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there is so much more to do. And we can do it together.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wrote Jill and me a letter about his daughter Courtney. Contagious laugh. Her sister’s best friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nCourtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually her death from a fentanyl overdose.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was 20 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescribing the last eight years without her, Doug said, “There is no worse pain.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYet their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end stigma and change laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told us he wants to “start the journey towards America’s recovery.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDoug, we’re with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nFentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production, sale, and trafficking, with more drug detection machines to inspect cargo and stop pills and powder at the border.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking with couriers like Fed Ex to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, let’s do more on mental health, especially for our children. When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at school.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it’s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, let’s do more to keep our nation’s one truly sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home.\\r\\n\\r\\nJob training and job placement for veterans and their spouses as they return to civilian life.\\r\\n\\r\\nHelping veterans afford their rent because no one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we cannot go on losing 17 veterans a day to the silent scourge of suicide.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screenings and a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they’re going through and get the help they need.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd fourth, last year Jill and I re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead in our Administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years. Turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases. And provide more support for patients and families.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s personal for so many of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I did.\\r\\n\\r\\nKindred spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wrote us a letter about their little daughter Ava.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney cancer.\\r\\n\\r\\n26 blood transfusions. 11 rounds of radiation. 8 rounds of chemo. 1 kidney removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 5% survival rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wrote how in the darkest moments he thought, “if she goes, I can’t stay.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJill and I understand, like so many of you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey read how Jill described our family’s cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where you can.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor them, that glimmer of joy was a half-smile from their baby girl. It meant everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey never gave up hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nAva never gave up hope. She turns four next month.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey just found out that Ava beat the odds and is on her way to being cancer free, and she’s watching from the White House tonight.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can do big things.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It’s been a huge success.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe we can do the same with cancer.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s one reason why we’re able to do all of these things: our democracy itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s the most fundamental thing of all.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nPut to the test here, in this very room, on January 6th.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, just a few months ago, unhinged by the Big Lie, an assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the then-Speaker of this House of Representatives. Using the very same language that insurrectionists who stalked these halls chanted on January 6th.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend, Paul Pelosi.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut such a heinous act never should have happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America. In America, we must protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental right. We honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemocracy must not be a partisan issue. It must be an American issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been called on to protect our democracy, to defend it, to stand up for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this is our moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the decisions we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are not bystanders to history. We are not powerless before the forces that confront us. It is within our power, of We the People. We are facing the test of our time and the time for choosing is at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must be the nation we have always been at our best. Optimistic. Hopeful. Forward-looking.\\r\\n\\r\\nA nation that embraces, light over darkness, hope over fear, unity over division. Stability over chaos.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We are a good people, the only nation in the world built on an idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I have come here to fulfil my constitutional duty to report on the state of the union. And here is my report.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I stand here tonight, I have never been more optimistic about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay God bless you all. May God protect our troops.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"February 7, 2023: State of the Union Address\"},{\"doc_name\":\"january-20-2021-inaugural-address\",\"date\":\"2021-01-20\",\"transcript\":\"Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is America’s day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is democracy’s day.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day of history and hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf renewal and resolve.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have learned again that democracy is precious.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemocracy is fragile.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this Capitol’s very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe look ahead in our uniquely American way – restless, bold, optimistic – and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thank them from the bottom of my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs does President Carter, who I spoke to last night but who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took — an oath first sworn by George Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn “We the People” who seek a more perfect Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a great nation and we are a good people.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. But we still have far to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch to repair.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch to restore.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch to heal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch to build.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd much to gain.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew periods in our nation’s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we’re in now.\\r\\n\\r\\nA once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\nMillions of jobs have been lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nHundreds of thousands of businesses closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo overcome these challenges – to restore the soul and to secure the future of America – requires more than words.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt requires that most elusive of things in a democracy:\\r\\n\\r\\nUnity.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another January in Washington, on New Year’s Day 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he put pen to paper, the President said, “If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy whole soul is in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, on this January day, my whole soul is in this:\\r\\n\\r\\nBringing America together.\\r\\n\\r\\nUniting our people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd uniting our nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ask every American to join me in this cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nUniting to fight the common foes we face:\\r\\n\\r\\nAnger, resentment, hatred.\\r\\n\\r\\nExtremism, lawlessness, violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisease, joblessness, hopelessness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith unity we can do great things. Important things.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can right wrongs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can put people to work in good jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can teach our children in safe schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can overcome this deadly virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health care\\r\\nsecure for all.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can deliver racial justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can make America, once again, the leading force for good in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I also know they are not new.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battle is perennial.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictory is never assured.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our “better angels” have always prevailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, we can do so now.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can treat each other with dignity and respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo progress, only exhausting outrage.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo nation, only a state of chaos.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, we must meet this moment as the United States of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have never, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted together.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so today, at this time and in this place, let us start afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us listen to one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nHear one another.\\r\\nSee one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nShow respect to one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery disagreement doesn’t have to be a cause for total war.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, we have to be different than this.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica has to be better than this.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, I believe America is better than this.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust look around.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we stand, in the shadow of a Capitol dome that was completed amid the Civil War, when the Union itself hung in the balance.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet we endured and we prevailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we stand looking out to the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protestors tried to block brave women from marching for the right to vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office – Vice President Kamala Harris.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon’t tell me things can’t change.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we stand across the Potomac from Arlington National Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, and to drive us from this sacred ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat did not happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will never happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot today.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo all those who supported our campaign I am humbled by the faith you have placed in us.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if you still disagree, so be it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s democracy. That’s America. The right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps our nation’s greatest strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I pledge this to you: I will be a President for all Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the common objects we love that define us as Americans?\\r\\n\\r\\nI think I know.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecurity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nDignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nRespect.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, yes, the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is truth and there are lies.\\r\\n\\r\\nLies told for power and for profit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders – leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation — to defend the truth and to defeat the lies.\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand that many Americans view the future with some fear and trepidation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand they worry about their jobs, about taking care of their families, about what comes next.\\r\\n\\r\\nI get it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don’t look like you do, or worship the way you do, or don’t get their news from the same sources you do.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we show a little tolerance and humility.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we’re willing to stand in the other person’s shoes just for a moment.\\r\\nBecause here is the thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate will deal you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some days when we need a hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are other days when we’re called on to lend one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is how we must be with one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we will need each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must set aside the politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI promise you this: as the Bible says weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will get through this, together\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world is watching today.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we have come out stronger for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot to meet yesterday’s challenges, but today’s and tomorrow’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have been through so much in this nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, in my first act as President, I would like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those 400,000 fellow Americans – mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and co-workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should be.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for our country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a time of testing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe face an attack on democracy and on truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nA raging virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing inequity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sting of systemic racism.\\r\\n\\r\\nA climate in crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica’s role in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with the gravest of responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we must step up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, this is certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will be judged, you and I, for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill we rise to the occasion?\\r\\n\\r\\nWill we master this rare and difficult hour?\\r\\n\\r\\nWill we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world for our children?\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe we must and I believe we will.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when we do, we will write the next chapter in the American story.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s called “American Anthem” and there is one verse stands out for me:\\r\\n\\r\\n“The work and prayers\\r\\nof centuries have brought us to this day\\r\\nWhat shall be our legacy?\\r\\nWhat will our children say?…\\r\\nLet me know in my heart\\r\\nWhen my days are through\\r\\nAmerica\\r\\nAmerica\\r\\nI gave my best to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we do this then when our days are through our children and our children’s children will say of us they gave their best.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did their duty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey healed a broken land.\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with a sacred oath.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore God and all of you I give you my word.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will always level with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will defend the Constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will defend our democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will defend America.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will give my all in your service thinking not of power, but of possibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot of personal interest, but of the public good.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf unity, not division.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf light, not darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn American story of decency and dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf love and of healing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf greatness and of goodness.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay this be the story that guides us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story that inspires us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe met the moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat our America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, with purpose and resolve we turn to the tasks of our time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSustained by faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nDriven by conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, devoted to one another and to this country we love with all our hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay God bless America and may God protect our troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, America.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"January 20, 2021: Inaugural Address\"},{\"doc_name\":\"january-6-2022-remarks-anniversary-january-6th-assault-us\",\"date\":\"2022-01-06\",\"transcript\":\"VICE PRESIDENT: Fellow Americans, good morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through them—where they were and what they were doing when our democracy came under assault. Dates that occupy not only a place on our calendars, but a place in our collective memory. December 7th, 1941. September 11th, 2001. And January 6th, 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn that day, I was not only Vice President-elect, I was also a United States senator. And I was here at the Capitol that morning, at a classified hearing with fellow members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Hours later, the gates of the Capitol were breached.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had left. But my thoughts immediately turned not only to my colleagues, but to my staff, who had been forced to seek refuge in our office, converting filing cabinets into barricades.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the extremists who roamed these halls targeted was not only the lives of elected leaders. What they sought to degrade and destroy was not only a building, hallowed as it is. What they were assaulting were the institutions, the values, the ideals that generations of Americans have marched, picketed, and shed blood to establish and defend.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 6th, we all saw what our nation would look like if the forces who seek to dismantle our democracy are successful. The lawlessness, the violence, the chaos.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was at stake then, and now, is the right to have our future decided the way the Constitution prescribes it: by we, the people—all the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot let our future be decided by those bent on silencing our voices, overturning our votes, and peddling lies and misinformation; by some radical faction that may be newly resurgent but whose roots run old and deep.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I meet with young people, they often ask about the state of our democracy, about January 6th. And what I tell them is: January 6th reflects the dual nature of democracy—its fragility and its strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou see, the strength of democracy is the rule of law. The strength of democracy is the principle that everyone should be treated equally, that elections should be free and fair, that corruption should be given no quarter. The strength of democracy is that it empowers the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the fragility of democracy is this: that if we are not vigilant, if we do not defend it, democracy simply will not stand; it will falter and fail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe violent assault that took place here, the very fact of how close we came to an election overturned—that reflects the fragility of democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, the resolve I saw in our elected leaders when I returned to the Senate chamber that night—their resolve not to yield but to certify the election; their loyalty not to party or person but to the Constitution of the United States—that reflects its strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, of course, does the heroism of the Capitol Police, the DC Metropolitan Police Department, the National Guard, and other law enforcement officers who answered the call that day, including those who later succumbed to wounds, both visible and invisible.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur thoughts are with all of the families who have lost a loved one.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, I wonder, how will January 6th come to be remembered in the years ahead?\\r\\n\\r\\nWill it be remembered as a moment that accelerated the unraveling of the oldest, greatest democracy in the world or a moment when we decided to secure and strengthen our democracy for generations to come?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American spirit is being tested.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer to whether we will meet that test resides where it always has resided in our country—with you, the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the work ahead will not be easy. Here, in this very building, a decision will be made about whether we uphold the right to vote and ensure free and fair election.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet's be clear: We must pass the voting rights bills that are now before the Senate, and the American people must also do something more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot sit on the sidelines. We must unite in defense of our democracy in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our prosperity and posterity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is the preamble of the Constitution that President Biden and I swore an oath to uphold and defend. And that is the enduring promise of the United States of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, it is my honor to introduce a public servant with the character and fortitude to meet this moment, a leader whose life's work has been moving our nation toward that more perfect union: President Joe Biden.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Madam Vice President, my fellow Americans: To state the obvious, one year ago today, in this sacred place, democracy was attacked—simply attacked. The will of the people was under assault. The Constitution—our Constitution—faced the gravest of threats.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutnumbered and in the face of a brutal attack, the Capitol Police, the DC Metropolitan Police Department, the National Guard, and other brave law enforcement officials saved the rule of law.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur democracy held. We the people endured. And we the people prevailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time in our history, a president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they failed. They failed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on this day of remembrance, we must make sure that such an attack never, never happens again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m speaking to you today from Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. This is where the House of Representatives met for 50 years in the decades leading up to the Civil War. This is—on this floor is where a young congressman of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, sat at desk 191. \\r\\n\\r\\nAbove him—above us, over that door leading into the Rotunda—is a sculpture depicting Clio, the muse of history. In her hands, an open book in which she records the events taking place in this chamber below.\\r\\n\\r\\nClio stood watch over this hall one year ago today, as she has for more than 200 years. She recorded what took place. The real history. The real facts. The real truth. The facts and the truth that Vice President Harris just shared and that you and I and the whole world saw with our own eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bible tells us that we shall know the truth, and the truth shall make us free. We shall know the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, here is the God’s truth about January 6th, 2021:\\r\\n\\r\\nClose your eyes. Go back to that day. What do you see? Rioters rampaging, waving for the first time inside this Capitol a Confederate flag that symbolized the cause to destroy America, to rip us apart.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven during the Civil War, that never, ever happened. But it happened here in 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat else do you see? A mob breaking windows, kicking in doors, breaching the Capitol. American flags on poles being used as weapons, as spears. Fire extinguishers being thrown at the heads of police officers. \\r\\n\\r\\nA crowd that professes their love for law enforcement assaulted those police officers, dragged them, sprayed them, stomped on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 140 police officers were injured.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve all heard the police officers who were there that day testify to what happened. One officer called it, quote, a med-—“medieval” battle, and that he was more afraid that day than he was fighting the war in Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey’ve repeatedly asked since that day: How dare anyone—anyone—diminish, belittle, or deny the hell they were put through?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe saw it with our own eyes. Rioters menaced these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House, literally erecting gallows to hang the Vice President of the United States of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what did we not see?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn’t see a former president, who had just rallied the mob to attack—sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives at risk, and the nation’s capital under siege.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis wasn’t a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey weren’t looking to uphold the will of the people. They were looking to deny the will of the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were looking to uphold—they weren’t looking to uphold a free and fair election. They were looking to overturn one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey weren’t looking to save the cause of America. They were looking to subvert the Constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis isn’t about being bogged down in the past. This is about making sure the past isn’t buried.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s the only way forward. That’s what great nations do. They don’t bury the truth, they face up to it. Sounds like hyperbole, but that’s the truth: They face up to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are a great nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, in life, there’s truth and, tragically, there are lies—lies conceived and spread for profit and power.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here is the truth: The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He’s done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests as more important than his country’s interests and America’s interests, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe can’t accept he lost, even though that’s what 93 United States senators, his own Attorney General, his own Vice President, governors and state officials in every battleground state have all said: He lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s what 81 million of you did as you voted for a new way forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has done what no president in American history—the history of this country—has ever, ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile some courageous men and women in the Republican Party are standing against it, trying to uphold the principles of that party, too many others are transforming that party into something else. They seem no longer to want to be the party—the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan, the Bushes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man, I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible. Because if we have a shared belief in democracy, then anything is possible—anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, at this moment, we must decide: What kind of nation are we going to be?\\r\\n\\r\\nAre we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?\\r\\n\\r\\nAre we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people?\\r\\n\\r\\nAre we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. The way forward is to recognize the truth and to live by it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Big Lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Election Day—November 3rd, 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nThink about that. Is that what you thought? Is that what you thought when you voted that day? Taking part in an insurrection? Is that what you thought you were doing? Or did you think you were carrying out your highest duty as a citizen and voting?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former president and his supporters are trying to rewrite history. They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection and the riot that took place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan you think of a more twisted way to look at this country—to look at America? I cannot.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere’s the truth: The election of 2020 was the greatest demonstration of democracy in the history of this country.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore of you voted in that election than have ever voted in all of American history. Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day in a pandemic—some at grea-—great risk to their lives. They should be applauded, not attacked.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now, in state after state, new laws are being written—not to protect the vote, but to deny it; not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert it; not to strengthen or protect our democracy, but because the former president lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of looking at the election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes, the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s wrong. It’s undemocratic. And frankly, it’s un-American.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second Big Lie being told by the former President and his supporters is that the results of the election of 2020 can’t be trusted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe truth is that no election—no election in American history has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country that could have been made was made and was rejected—often rejected by Republican-appointed judges, including judges appointed by the former president himself, from state courts to the United States Supreme Court.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecounts were undertaken in state after state. Georgia—Georgia counted its results three times, with one recount by hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhony partisan audits were undertaken long after the election in several states. None changed the results. And in some of them, the irony is the margin of victory actually grew slightly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, let’s speak plainly about what happened in 2020. Even before the first ballot was cast, the former president was preemptively sowing doubt about the election results. He built his lie over months. It wasn’t based on any facts. He was just looking for an excuse—a pretext—to cover for the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe’s not just a former president. He’s a defeated former president—defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate. In fact, in every venue where evidence had to be produced and an oath to tell the truth had to be taken, the former president failed to make his case.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust think about this: The former president and his supporters have never been able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election results that took place on November 3rd—the elections for governor, United States Senate, the House of Representatives—elections in which they closed the gap in the House.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey challenge none of that. The President’s name was first, then we went down the line—governors, senators, House of Representatives. Somehow, those results were accurate on the same ballot, but the presidential race was flawed?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on the same ballot, the same day, cast by the same voters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only difference: The former President didn’t lose those races; he just lost the one that was his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the third Big Lie being told by a former President and his supporters is that the mob who sought to impose their will through violence are the nation’s true patriots.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the Capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways, rifling through desks of senators and representatives, hunting down members of congress? Patriots? Not in my view.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo me, the true patriots were the more than 150 [million] Americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box, the election workers who protected the integrity of the vote, and the heroes who defended this Capitol.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can’t love your country only when you win.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can’t obey the law only when it’s convenient.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can’t be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of America—at American democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey didn’t come here out of patriotism or principle. They came here in rage—not in service of America, but rather in service of one man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who incited the mob—the real plotters—who were desperate to deny the certification of the election and defy the will of the voters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut their plot was foiled. Congressmen—Democrats and Republicans—stayed. Senators, representatives, staff—they finished their work the Constitution demanded. They honored their oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, folks, now it’s up to all of us—to “We the People”—to stand for the rule of law, to preserve the flame of democracy, to keep the promise of America alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat promise is at risk, targeted by the forces that value brute strength over the sanctity of democracy, fear over hope, personal gain over public good.\\r\\n\\r\\nMake no mistake about it: We’re living at an inflection point in history.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth at home and abroad, we’re engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy, between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few, between the people’s right of self-determination and self-—the self-seeking autocrat. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom China to Russia and beyond, they’re betting that democracy’s days are numbered. They’ve actually told me democracy is too slow, too bogged down by division to succeed in today’s rapidly changing, complicated world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they’re betting—they’re betting America will become more like them and less like us. They’re betting that America is a place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not believe that. That is not who we are. That is not who we have ever been. And that is not who we should ever, ever be.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Founding Fathers, as imperfect as they were, set in motion an experiment that changed the world—literally changed the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere in America, the people would rule, power would be transferred peacefully—never at the tip of a spear or the barrel of a gun.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they committed to paper an idea that couldn’t live up to—they couldn’t live up to but an idea that couldn’t be constrained: Yes, in America all people are created equal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reject the view that if you succeed, I fail; if you get ahead, I fall behind; if I hold you down, I somehow lift myself up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former President, who lies about this election, and the mob that attacked this Capitol could not be further away from the core American values.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey want to rule or they will ruin—ruin what our country fought for at Lexington and Concord; at Gettysburg; at Omaha Beach; Seneca Falls; Selma, Alabama. What—and what we were fighting for: the right to vote, the right to govern ourselves, the right to determine our own destiny.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to see each other as neighbors—maybe we disagree with that neighbor, but they’re not an adversary; the responsibility to accept defeat then get back in the arena and try again the next time to make your case; the responsibility to see that America is an idea—an idea that requires vigilant stewardship.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we stand here today—one year since January 6th, 2021—the lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, we have to be firm, resolute, and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote counted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome have already made the ultimate sacrifice in this sacred effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nJill and I have mourned police officers in this Capitol Rotunda not once but twice in the wake of January 6th: once to honor Officer Brian Sicknick, who lost his life the day after the attack, and a second time to honor Officer Billy Evans, who lost his life defending this Capitol as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe think about the others who lost their lives and were injured and everyone living with the trauma of that day—from those defending this Capitol to members of Congress in both parties and their staffs, to reporters, cafeteria workers, custodial workers, and their families.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon’t kid yourself: The pain and scars from that day run deep.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said it many times and it’s no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6th: We are in a battle for the soul of America. A battle that, by the grace of God and the goodness and gracious—and greatness of this nation, we will win.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelieve me, I know how difficult democracy is. And I’m crystal clear about the threats America faces. But I also know that our darkest days can lead to light and hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the death and destruction, as the Vice President referenced, in Pearl Harbor came the triumph over the forces of fascism.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the brutality of Bloody Sunday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge came historic voting rights legislation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, now let us step up, write the next chapter in American history where January 6th marks not the end of democracy, but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it either.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will make sure the will of the people is heard; that the ballot prevails, not violence; that authority in this nation will always be peacefully transferred.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe the power of the presidency and the purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it; to lift us up, not tear us apart; to be about us—about us, not about “me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDeep in the heart of America burns a flame lit almost 250 years ago—of liberty, freedom, and equality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not a land of kings or dictators or autocrats. We’re a nation of laws; of order, not chaos; of peace, not violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere in America, the people rule through the ballot, and their will prevails.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, let us remember: Together, we’re one nation, under God, indivisible; that today, tomorrow, and forever, at our best, we are the United States of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nGod bless you all. May God protect our troops. And may God bless those who stand watch over our democracy.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"January 6, 2022: Remarks on the Anniversary of the January 6th Assault on the US Capitol\"},{\"doc_name\":\"july-8-2021-speech-drawdown-us-forces-afghanistan\",\"date\":\"2021-07-08\",\"transcript\":\"THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Earlier today, I was briefed by our senior military and national security leaders on the status of the drawdown of U.S. forces and allied forces in Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I announced our drawdown in April, I said we would be out by September, and we’re on track to meet that target.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on August 31st. The drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way, prioritizing the safety of our troops as they depart.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur military commanders advised me that once I made the decision to end the war, we needed to move swiftly to conduct the main elements of the drawdown. And in this context, speed is safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thanks to the way in which we have managed our withdrawal, no one—no one U.S. forces or any forces have—have been lost. Conducting our drawdown differently would have certainly come with an increased risk of safety to our personnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo me, those risks were unacceptable. And there was never any doubt that our military would perform this task efficiently and with the highest level of professionalism. That’s what they do. And the same is true of our NATO Allies and partners who have supported—we are supporting, and supporting us as well, as they conclude their retrograde.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to be clear: The U.S. military mission in Afghanistan continues through the end of August. We remain—we retain personnel and capacities in the country, and we maintain some authority—excuse me, the same authority under which we’ve been operating for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I said in April, the United States did what we went to do in Afghanistan: to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and to deliver justice to Osama Bin Laden, and to degrade the terrorist threat to keep Afghanistan from becoming a base from which attacks could be continued against the United States. We achieved those objectives. That’s why we went.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build. And it’s the right and the responsibility of the Afghan people alone to decide their future and how they want to run their country.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether, with our NATO Allies and partners, we have trained and equipped over three hu-—nearly 300,000 current serving members of the military—of the Afghan National Security Force, and many beyond that who are no longer serving. Add to that, hundreds of thousands more Afghan National Defense and Security Forces trained over the last two decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe provided our Afghan partners with all the tools—let me emphasize: all the tools, training, and equipment of any modern military. We provided advanced weaponry. And we’re going to continue to provide funding and equipment. And we’ll ensure they have the capacity to maintain their air force.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut most critically, as I stressed in my meeting just two weeks ago with President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah, Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future that the Afghan people want and they deserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our meeting, I also assured Ghani that U.S. support for the people of Afghanistan will endure. We will continue to provide civilian and humanitarian assistance, including speaking out for the rights of women and girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nI intend to maintain our diplomatic presence in Afghanistan, and we are coordinating closely with our international partners in order to continue to secure the international airport.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’re going to engage in a determined diplomacy to pursue peace and a peace agreement that will end this senseless violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve asked Secretary of State Blinken and our Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation to work vigorously with the parties in Afghanistan, as well as the regional and international stakeholders to support a negotiated solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be clear—to be clear: Countries in the region have an essential role to play in supporting a peaceful settlement. We’ll work with them, and they should help step up their efforts as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re going to continue to work for the release of detained Americans, including Mark—excuse me—Fre– Frerichs—I want to pronounce the name correctly; I mis-—I misspoke—so that he can return to his family safely.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re also going to continue to make sure that we take on the Afghan nationals who work side-by-side with U.S. forces, including interpreters and translators—since we’re no longer going to have military there after this; we’re not going to need them and they have no jobs—who are also going to be vital to our efforts so they—and they’ve been very vital—and so their families are not exposed to danger as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve already dramatically accelerated the procedure time for Special Immigrant Visas to bring them to the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince I was inaugurated on January 20th, we’ve already approved 2,500 Special Immigrant Visas to come to the United States. Up to now, fewer than half have exercised their right to do that. Half have gotten on aircraft and com—commercial flights and come, and the other half believe they want to stay—at least thus far.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re working closely with Congress to change the authorization legislation so that we can streamline the process of approving those visas. And those who have stood up for the operation to physically relocate thousands of Afghans and their families before the U.S. military mission concludes so that, if they choose, they can wait safely outside of Afghanistan while their U.S. visas are being processed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe operation has identified U.S. facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as in third countries, to host our Afghan allies, if they ch-—if they so choose. And, starting this month, we’re going to begin to re-—re-—reloc-—we’re going to begin relocation flights for Afghanistan SIV applicants and their families who choose to leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have a point person in the White House and at the State Department-led task force coordinating all these efforts.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut our message to those women and men is clear: There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose, and we will stand with you just as you stood with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I made the decision to end the U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, I judged that it was not in the national interest of the United States of America to continue fighting this war indefinitely. I made the decision with clear eyes, and I am briefed daily on the battlefield updates.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut for those who have argued that we should stay just six more months or just one more year, I ask them to consider the lessons of recent history.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, the NATO Allies and partners agreed that we would end our combat mission in 2014. In 2014, some argued, “One more year.” So we kept fighting, and we kept taking casualties. In 2015, the same. And on and on.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly 20 years of experience has shown us that the current security situation only confirms that “just one more year” of fighting in Afghanistan is not a solution but a recipe for being there indefinitely.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s up to Afghans to make the decision about the future of their country.\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers are more direct. Their argument is that we should stay with the Afghan—in Afghanistan indefinitely. In doing so, they point to the fact that we—we have not taken losses in this last year, so they claim that the cost of just maintaining the status quo is minimal.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that ignores the reality and the facts that already presented on the ground in Afghanistan when I took office: The Taliban was at its strongest mil-—is at its strongest militarily since 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan had been reduced to a bare minimum. And the United States, in the last administration, made an agreement that the—with the Taliban to remove all our forces by May 1 of this past—of this year. That’s what I inherited. That agreement was the reason the Taliban had ceased major attacks against U.S. forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, in April, I had instead announced that the United States was going to back—going back on that agreement made by the last administration—[that] the United States and allied forces would remain in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future—the Taliban would have again begun to target our forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe status quo was not an option. Staying would have meant U.S. troops taking casualties; American men and women back in the middle of a civil war. And we would have run the risk of having to send more troops back into Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce that agreement with the Taliban had been made, staying with a bare minimum force was no longer possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo let me ask those who wanted us to stay: How many more—how many thousands more of America’s daughters and sons are you willing to risk? How long would you have them stay?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready we have members of our military whose parents fought in Afghanistan 20 years ago. Would you send their children and their grandchildren as well? Would you send your own son or daughter?\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 20 years—a trillion dollars spent training and equipping hundreds of thousands of Afghan National Security and Defense Forces, 2,448 Americans killed, 20,722 more wounded, and untold thousands coming home with unseen trauma to their mental health—I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States cannot afford to remain tethered to policies creating a response to a world as it was 20 years ago. We need to meet the threats where they are today.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the terrorist threat has metastasized beyond Afghanistan. So, we are repositioning our resources and adapting our counterterrorism posture to meet the threats where they are now significantly higher: in South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut make no mistake: Our military and intelligence leaders are confident they have the capabilities to protect the homeland and our interests from any resurgent terrorist challenge emerging or emanating from Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are developing a counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region, and act quickly and decisively if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we also need to focus on shoring up America’s core strengths to meet the strategic competition with China and other nations that is really going to determine—determine our future.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have to defeat COVID-19 at home and around the world, make sure we’re better prepared for the next pandemic or biological threat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need to establish international norms for cyberspace and the use of emergenc-—emerging technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need to take concerted action to fight existential threats of climate change.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we will be more formidable to our adversaries and competitors over the long run if we fight the battles of the next 20 years, not the last 20 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I want to recognize the incredible sacrifice and dedication that the U.S. military and civilian personnel, serving alongside our Allies and partners, have made over the last two decades in Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to honor the significance of what they’ve accomplished and the great personal risk they encountered and the incredible cost to their families: pursuing the terrorist threat in some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planet—and I’ve been almost throughout that entire country; ensuring there hasn’t been another attack on the homeland from Afghanistan for the last 20 years; taking out Bin Laden.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to thank you all for your service and the dedication to the mission so many of you have given, and to the sacrifices that you and your families have made over the long course of this war.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll never forget those who gave the last full measure of devotion for their country in Afghanistan, nor those whose lives have been immeasurably altered by wounds sustained in service to their country.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re ending America’s longest war, but we’ll always, always honor the bravery of the American patriots who served in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President—do you trust the Taliban, Mr. President?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Is a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now inevitable?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, it is not.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Why?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Because you—the Afghan troops have 300,000 well-equipped—as well-equipped as any army in the world—and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban. It is not inevitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Do you trust the Taliban, Mr. President? Do you trust the Taliban, sir?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: You—is that a serious question?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: It is absolutely a serious question. Do you trust the Taliban?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I do not.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Do you trust handing over the country to the Taliban?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I do not trust the Taliban.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: So why are you handing the country over?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, is the U.S. responsible for the deaths of Afghans after you leave the country?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, will you amplify that question, please? Will you amplify your answer, please—why you don’t trust the Taliban?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: It’s a—it’s a silly question. Do I trust the Taliban? No. But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped, and more re-—more competent in terms of conducting war.Yes, ma’am.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. Given the amount of money that has been spent and the number of lives that have been lost, in your view, with making this decision, were the last 20 years worth it?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: You know my record. I can tell by the way you asked the question.\\r\\n\\r\\nI opposed permanently having American forces in Afghanistan. I argued, from the beginning, as you may recall—it came to light after the administration was over, last—our administration—no nation has ever unified Afghanistan. No nation. Empires have gone there and not done it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus we had—and I strongly support it—and you may remember I physically went to Afghanistan. I was up in that pass where Osama bin Laden was—allegedly escaped or—out of harm’s way.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went for two reasons: one, to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as I said at the time. The second reason was to eliminate al Qaeda’s capacity to deal with more attacks on the United States from that territory. We accomplished both of those objectives—period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s what I believed, from the beginning, why we should be and why we should have gone to Afghanistan. That job had been over for some time. And that’s why I believe that this is the right decision and, quite frankly, overdue.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, has the civilian government hailed the people of Afghanistan?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, thank you very much. Your own intelligence community has assessed that the Afghan government will likely collapse.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: That is not true.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Is it—can you please clarify what they have told you about whether that will happen or not?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: That is not true. They did not—they didn’t—did not reach that conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: So what is the level of confidence that they have that it will not collapse?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: The Afghan government and leadership has to come together. They clearly have the capacity to sustain the government in place. The question is: Will they generate the kind of cohesion to do it? It’s not a question of whether they have the capacity. They have the capacity. They have the forces. They have the equipment. The question is: Will they do it?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I want to make clear what I made clear to Ghani: that we are not going just sus-—walk away and not sustain their ability to maintain that force. We are. We’re going to also work to make sure we help them in terms of everything from food necessities and other things in—in the region. But—but, there’s not a conclusion that, in fact, they cannot defeat the Taliban.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe the only way there’s going to be—this is now Joe Biden, not the intelligence community—the only way there’s ultimately going to be peace and security in Afghanistan is that they work out a modus vivendi with the Taliban and they make a judgment as to how they can make peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the likelihood there’s going to be one unified government in Afghanistan controlling the whole country is highly unlikely.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, thank you. But we have talked to your own top general in Afghanistan, General Scott Miller. He told ABC News the conditions are so concerning at this point that it could result in a civil war. So, if Kabul falls to the Taliban, what will the United States do about it?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Look, you’ve said two things—one, that if it could result in a civil war—that’s different than the Taliban succeeding, number one. Number two, the question of what will be done is going to be implicated—is going to implicate the entire region as well. There’s a number of countries who have a grave concern about what’s going to happen in Afghanistan relative to their security.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question is: How much of a threat to the United States of America and to our allies is whatever results in terms of a government or an agreement? That’s when that judgement will be made.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, some Vietnamese veterans see echoes of their experience in this withdrawal in Afghanistan. Do you see any parallels between this withdrawal and what happened in Vietnam, with some people feeling —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: None whatsoever. Zero. What you had is—you had entire brigades breaking through the gates of our embassy—six, if I’m not mistaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Taliban is not the south—the North Vietnamese army. They’re not—they’re not remotely comparable in terms of capability. There’s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy in the—of the United States from Afghanistan. It is not at all comparable.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: And, Mr. President —\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, can I —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I’ll take him and then I’ll—and then I’ll go—I’ll go to the other side. Hang on a second.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, how serious was the corruption among the Afghanistan government to this mission failing there?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, the mission hasn’t failed, yet. There is in Afghanistan—in all parties, there’s been corruption. The question is, can there be an agreement on unity of purpose? What is the objective?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, it started off—there were going to be negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan National Security Forces and the Afghan government. That—that of—it didn’t come to—it didn’t come to fruition.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the question now is, where do they go from here? That—the jury is still out. But the likelihood there’s going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, ma’am.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, will the United States be responsible for the loss of Afghan civilian lives that could happen after a —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ:—military exit?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, no, no. It’s up to the people of Afghanistan to decide on what government they want, not us to impose the government on them. No country has ever been able to do that.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep in mind, as a student of history, as I’m sure you are, never has Afghanistan been a united country, not in all of its history. Not in all of its history.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, if this isn’t a “mission accomplished” moment, what is it, in your view?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, there’s no “mission accomplished.”\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: How would you describe it?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: The mission was accomplished in that we get—got Osama bin Laden, and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, if “speed is safety,” as you just said in your remarks, are you satisfied with the timeline of relocating Afghan nationals? Is it happening quickly enough to your satisfaction, if it may not happen until next month, at the end?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, much of it has already happened. There’s already been people—about a thousand people have gotten on aircraft and come home—come to the United States already on commercial aircraft. So, as I said, there’s over 2,500 people that as—from January to now, have gotten those visas. And only half decided that they wanted to leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe point is that I think the whole process has to be speeded up, period, in terms of being able to get these visas.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Why can’t the U.S. evacuate these Afghan translators to the United States to await their visa processing as some immigrants at the southern border have been allowed to do?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Because the law doesn’t allow that to happen. And that’s why we’re asking the Congress to consider changing the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the meantime, we can guarantee their safety, if they wish to leave, by taking them to third countries and/or, while the wait is taking place, to come to—to—and hopefully, while they’re waiting there, to be able to bring them back to the United States, if that’s what they choose to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: And what do you make—and what do you make, sir, of the Taliban being in Russia today?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, I’m from Afghanistan. I am Afghan (inaudible) woman. Any message—good message for Afghan women in future? Because they have achievement—they are really concerned about their achievement.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: They are very concerned, with good reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: When I was in Afghanistan—I’ve been there a number of times—I remember being in a school outside and—and, by the way, the schools in Afghanistan are not fundamentally unlike schools in the West Coast, where they have, you know, a—an area in the middle that is sort of like—it looks like a playground and single-story buildings connected around it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I remember saying to—speaking to a group of young women—I guess they were roughly—don’t hold me to this—they look like they’d be 14, 15 years old. And they’re in school, and there’s a tiered classroom with single light bulbs hanging from the ceiling, as I know you know.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I said, “You know, the United States came here to make sure that we got this terrorist, Osama bin Laden, and that terrorists didn’t amass again to—to go after our country. And then we’re going to have to leave.” And a young woman said, “You can’t leave. You can’t leave.” It was—it was heartbreaking. “You can’t leave,” she said. “I want to be a doctor. I want to be a doctor. I want to be a doctor. If you leave, I’ll never be able to be a doctor.” Well, that’s why we spent so much time and money training the Afghan Security Forces to do the work of defending that. If every work —\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, anyway—so, yes, I’m aware.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m going to take one more question.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr. President, have you spoken with any Taliban officials about the withdrawal?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: (Inaudible) the Taliban being in Russia today—the Taliban —\\r\\n\\r\\nQ: Mr.—Mr. President, I—thank you. I wanted to ask: With the benefit of hindsight, you’ve spoken to the fact that the Taliban are sort of at their militarily strongest point that you’ve seen in 20 years. How do you feel personally about that, with the benefit of hindsight and all of the dollars and investments and American troops that were sent there?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Relative to the training and capacity of the ANSF and the training of the federal police, they’re not even close in terms of their capacity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was making the point—the point was that here we were; I was—the argument is, “Well, we could stay because no one was dying. No Americans are being shot. So why leave?” Once the agreement was made by the last administration that we were going to leave by May 1st, it was very clear that a Taliban that had always been a problem was even a more sophisticated problem than they were than before. Not more sophisticated than the ANSF, the government. More than they were.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe point being that it would have increased the prospect that they would have been able to take more lives of Americans if they decided we weren’t going to go after them. That was the point I was making.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you all so very much. Thank you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"July 8, 2021: Speech on the Drawdown of US Forces in Afghanistan\"},{\"doc_name\":\"june-1-2021-remarks-commemorating-100th-anniversary-tulsa-race\",\"date\":\"2021-06-01\",\"transcript\":\"THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you.

And in case you were wondering, I—in Delaware—we’re a small state—we have the eighth-largest Black population in America, and we have one of the most talented members of Congress. And so if I didn’t walk around and pay my tribute to Lisa Blunt Rochester my congresswoman—(applause)—immediately, that was —\\r\\n\\r\\nHow are you, Rev? Good to see you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve got a distinguished group of people here, and I want to thank Lauren for sharing the powerful story and for helping the country understand what’s happening here.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to all of the descendants here today, and to the community and civil rights leaders, and members of the Congressional Black Caucus that are here: Thank you for making sure we all remember and we never forget.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, there’s a verse in First Corinthians that says, “For now, we see in a mirror dimly, but then, face to face, now I know in part, then I shall know fully.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is—I just toured the Hall of Survivors here in Greenwood Cultural Center, and I want to thank the incredible staff for hosting us here. And—(applause)—I mean that sincerely. Thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if I didn’t say what my father would insist on, please excuse my back. (Laughter.) I apologize.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the tour—in the tour, I met Mother Randle, who’s only 56 [107] years old. (Laughter.) God love her. And Mother Fletcher, who’s 67 [106] years old. (Laughter.) And her brother—her brother, Van Ellis, who’s 100 years old. (Laughter.) And he looks like he’s 60. Thank you for spending so much time with me. I really mean it. It was a great honor. A genuine honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are the three known remaining survivors of a story seen in the mirror dimly. But no longer. Now your story will be known in full view.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe events we speak of today took place 100 years ago. And yet, I’m the first President in 100 years ever to come to Tulsa—(applause)—I say that not as a compliment about me, but to think about it—a hundred years, and the first President to be here during that entire time, and in this place, in this ground, to acknowledge the truth of what took place here.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness. But just because history is silent, it doesn’t mean that it did not take place. And while darkness can hide much, it erases nothing. It erases nothing. Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous they can’t be buried, no matter how hard people try.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it is here. Only—only with truth can come healing and justice and repair. Only with truth, facing it. But that isn’t enough. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, we have to see, hear, and give respect to Mother Randle, Mother Fletcher, and Mr. Van Ellis. (Applause.) To all those lost so many years ago, to all the descendants of those who suffered, to this community—that’s why we’re here: to shine a light, to make sure America knows the story in full.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay 1921: Formerly enslaved Black people and their descendants are here in Tulsa—a boom town of oil and opportunity in a new frontier.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the north side, across the rail tracks that divided the city already segregated by law, they built something of their own, worthy—worthy of their talent and their ambition: Greenwood—a community, a way of life. Black doctors and lawyers, pastors, teachers; running hospitals, law practices, libraries, churches, schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack veterans, like a man I had the privilege to giving a Command Coin to, who fought—volunteered and fought, and came home and still faced such prejudice. (Applause.) Veterans had been back a few years helping after winning the first World War, building a new life back home with pride and confidence, who were a mom-and—they were, at the time—mom-and-plack [sic]—mom-and-pop Black diners, grocery stores, barber shops, tailors—the things that make up a community.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Dreamland Theatre, a young Black couple, holding hands, falling in love. Friends gathered at music clubs and pool halls; at the Monroe family roller-skating rink. Visitors staying in hotels, like the Stradford.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll around, Black pride shared by the professional class and the working class who lived together, side by side, for blocks on end.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Randle was just six years old—six years old—living with her grandmom. She said she was lucky to have a home and toys, and fortunate to live without fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Fletcher was seven years old, the second of seven children. The youngest, being Mr. Van Ellis, was just a few months old. The children of former sharecroppers, when they went to bed at night in Greenwood, Mother Fletcher says they fell asleep rich in terms of the wealth—not real wealth, but a different wealth—a wealth in culture and community and heritage. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nBut one night—one night changed everything. Everything changed. While Greenwood was a community to itself, it was not separated from the outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn’t everyone, but there was enough hate, resentment, and vengeance in the community. Enough people who believed that America does not belong to everyone and not everyone is created equal—Native Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Black Americans. A belief enforced by law, by badge, by hood and by noose. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it speaks to that—lit the fuse. It lit it by the spark that it provided—a fuse of fury—was an innocent interaction that turned into an in-—a terrible, terrible headline allegation of a Black male teenager attacking a white female teenager.\\r\\n\\r\\nA white mob of 1,000 gathered around the courthouse where the Black teenager was being held, ready to do what still occurred: lynch that young man that night. But 75 Black men, including Black veterans, arrived to stand guard. \\r\\n\\r\\nWords were exchanged. Then a scuffle. Then shots fired. Hell was unleashed. Literal hell was unleashed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the night and into the morning, the mob terrorized Greenwood. Torches and guns. Shooting at will. A mob tied a Black man by the waist to the back of their truck with his head banging along the pavement as they drove off. A murdered Black family draped over the fence of their home outside. An elderly couple, knelt by their bed, praying to God with their heart and their soul, when they were shot in the back of their heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate planes—private planes—dropping explosives—the first and only domestic aerial assault of its kind on an American city here in Tulsa.\\r\\n\\r\\nEight of Greenwood’s nearly two dozen churches burned, like Mt. Zion—across the street, at Vernon AME.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Randle said it was like war. Mother Fletcher says, all these years later, she still sees Black bodies around.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greenwood newspaper publisher A.J. Smitherton [sic]—excuse me—Smitherman penned a poem of what he heard and felt that night. And here’s the poem. He said, “Kill them, burn them, set the pace… teach them how to keep their place. Reign of murder, theft, and plunder was the order of the night.” That’s what he remembered in the poem that he wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne hundred years ago at this hour, on this first day of June, smoke darkened the Tulsa sky, rising from 35 blocks of Greenwood that were left in ash and ember, razed and in rubble.\\r\\n\\r\\nLess than 24 hours—in less than 24 hours, 1,100 Black homes and businesses were lost. Insurance companies—they had insurance, many of them—rejected claims of damage. Ten thousand people were left destitute and homeless, placed in internment camps.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was told today, they were told, “Don’t you mention you were ever in a camp or we’ll come and get you.” That’s what survivors told me.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet no one—no arrests of the mob were made. None. No proper accounting of the dead. The death toll records by local officials said there were 36 people. That’s all. Thirty-six people.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut based on studies, records, and accounts, the likelihood—the likely number is much more, in the multiple of hundreds. Untold bodies dumped into mass graves. Families who, at the time, waited for hours and days to know the fate of their loved ones are now descendants who have gone 100 years without closure.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, you know, as we speak, the process—the process of exhuming the unmarked graves has started. And at this moment, I’d like to pause for a moment of silence for the fathers, the mothers, the sisters, sons, and daughters, friends of God and Greenwood. They deserve dignity, and they deserve our respect. May their souls rest in peace.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Pause for a moment of silence.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, this was not a riot. This was a massacre—(applause)—among the worst in our history, but not the only one. And for too long, forgotten by our history.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as it happened, there was a clear effort to erase it from our memory—our collective memories—from the news and everyday conversations. For a long time, schools in Tulsa didn’t even teach it, let alone schools elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd most people didn’t realize that, a century ago, a second Ku Klux Klan had been founded—the second Ku Klux Klan had been founded.\\r\\n\\r\\nA friend of mine, Jon Meacham—I had written—when I said I was running to restore the soul of America, he wrote a book called “The Soul of America”—not because of what I said. And there’s a picture about page 160 in his book, showing over 30,000 Ku Klux Klan members in full regalia, Reverend—pointed hats, the robes—marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. Jesse, you know all about this. Washin-—Washington, D.C.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf my memory is correct, there were 37 members of the House of Representatives who were open members of the Klan. There were five, if I’m not mistaken—it could have been seven; I think it was five—members of the United States Senate—open members of the Klan. Multiple governors who were open members of the Klan.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people didn’t realize that, a century ago, the Klan was founded just six years before the horrific destruction here in Tulsa. And one of the reasons why it was founded was because of guys like me, who were Catholic. It wasn’t about African Americans, then; it was about making sure that all those Polish and Irish and Italian and Eastern European Catholics who came to the United States after World War One would not pollute Christianity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flames from those burning crosses torched every region—region of the country. Millions of white Americans belonged to the Klan, and they weren’t even embarrassed by it; they were proud of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that hate became embedded systematically and systemically in our laws and our culture. We do ourselves no favors by pretending none of this ever happened or that it doesn’t impact us today, because it does still impact us today.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can’t just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know. (Applause.) We should know the good, the bad, everything. That’s what great nations do: They come to terms with their dark sides. And we’re a great nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only way to build a common ground is to truly repair and to rebuild. I come here to help fill the silence, because in silence, wounds deepen. (Applause.) And only—as painful as it is, only in remembrance do wounds heal. We just have to choose to remember.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe memorialize what happened here in Tulsa so it can be –so it can’t be erased. We know here, in this hallowed place, we simply can’t bury pain and trauma forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd at some point, there will be a reckoning, an inflection point, like we’re facing right now as a nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat many people hadn’t seen before or ha-—or simply refused to see cannot be ignored any longer. You see it in so many places. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there’s greater recognition that, for too long, we’ve allowed a narrowed, cramped view of the promise of this nation to fester—the view that America is a zero-sum game where there is only one winner. “If you succeed, I fail. If you get ahead, I fall behind. If you get a job, I lose mine.” And maybe worst of all, “If I hold you down, I lift myself up,” instead of “If you do well, we all do well.” (Applause.) We see that in Greenwood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis story isn’t about the loss of life, but a loss of living, of wealth and prosterity [prosperity] and possibilities that still reverberates today.\\r\\n\\r\\nMother Fletcher talks about how she was only able to attend school until the fourth grade and eventually found work in the shipyards, as a domestic worker.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Van Ellis has shared how, even after enlisting and serving in World War Two, he still came home to struggle with a segregated America.\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine all those hotels and dinners [diners] and mom-and-pop shops that could been—have been passed down this past hundred years. Imagine what could have been done for Black families in Greenwood: financial security and generational wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you come from backgrounds like my—my family—a working-class, middle-class family—the only way we were ever able to generate any wealth was in equity in our homes. Imagine what they contributed then and what they could’ve contributed all these years. Imagine a thriving Greenwood in North Tulsa for the last hundred years, what that would’ve meant for all of Tulsa, including the white community.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the people of Greenwood rebuilt again in the years after the massacre, it didn’t last. Eventually neighborhoods were redlined on maps, locking Black Tulsa out of homeownerships. (Applause.) A highway was built right through the heart of the community. Lisa, I was talking about our west side—what 95 did to it after we were occupied by the military, after Dr. King was murdered. The community—cutting off Black families and businesses from jobs and opportunity. Chronic underinvestment from state and federal governments denied Greenwood even just a chance at rebuilding. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must find the courage to change the things we know we can change. That’s what Vice President Harris and I are focused on, along with our entire administration, including our Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Marcia Fudge, who is here today. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause today, we’re announcing two expanded efforts targeted toward Black wealth creation that will also help the entire community. The first is: My administration has launched an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing. That includes everything from redlining to the cruel fact that a home owned by a Black family is too often appraised at a lower value than a similar home owned by a white family. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I might add—and I need help if you have an answer to this; I can’t figure this one out, Congressman Horsford. But if you live in a Black community and there’s another one on the other side of the highway—it’s a white community; it’s the—built by the same builder, and you have a better driving record than they guy with the same car in the white community, you’re—can pay more for your auto insurance. \\r\\n\\r\\nShockingly, the percentage of Black American homeownership is lower today in America than when the Fair Housing Act was passed more than 50 years ago. Lower today. That’s wrong. And we’re committing to changing that.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust imagine if instead of denying millions of Americans the ability to own their own home and build generational wealth, we made it possible for them to buy a home and build equity into that—into that home and provide for their families.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, small businesses are the engines of our economy and the glue of our communities. As President, my administration oversees hundreds of billions of dollars in federal contracts for everything from refurbishing decks of aircraft carriers, to installing railings in federal buildings, to professional services.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have a thing called—I won’t go into it all because there’s not enough time now. But I’m determined to use every taxpayer’s dollar that is assigned to me to spend, going to American companies and American workers to build Ameri– to build American products. And as part of that, I’m going to increase the share of the dollars the federal government spends to small, disadvantaged businesses, including Black and brown small businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now, it calls for 10 percent; I’m going to move that to 15 percent of every dollar spent will be spent (inaudible). (Applause.) I have the authority to do that. \\r\\n\\r\\nJust imagine if, instead of denying millions of entrepreneurs the ability to access capital and contracting, we made it possible to take their dreams to the marketplace to create jobs and invest in our communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat—the data shows young Black entrepreneurs are just as capable of succeeding, given the chance, as white entrepreneurs are. But they don’t have lawyers. They don’t have—they—they don’t have accountants, but they have great ideas. \\r\\n\\r\\nDoes anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off from the investments those people make? And I promise you, that’s why I set up the—a national Small Business Administration that’s much broader. Because they’re going to get those loans. \\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of consigning millions of American children to under-resourced schools, let’s give each and every child, three and four years old, access to school—not daycare, school. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last 10 years, studies have been done by all the great universities. It shows that, if increased by 56 percent, the possibility of a child—no matter what background they come from; no matter what—if they start school at three years old, they have a 56 percent chance of going all through all 12 years without any trouble and being able to do well, and a chance to learn and grow and thrive in a school and throughout their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let’s unlock more than—an incredible creativity and innovation that will come from the nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities. (Applause.) I have a $5 billion program giving them the resources to invest in research centers and laboratories and high-demand fields to compete for the good-paying jobs in industries like—of the future, like cybersecurity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason why they don’t—their—their students are equally able to learn as well, and get the good-paying job that start at 90- and 100,000 bucks. But they don’t have—they don’t have the back—they don’t have the money to provide and build those laboratories. So, guess what? They’re going to get the money to build those laboratories. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, instead of just talking about infrastructure, let’s get about the—about the business of actually rebuilding roads and highways, filling the sidewalks and cracks, installing streetlights and high-speed Internet, creating space—space to live and work and play safely.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s ensure access to healthcare, clean water, clean air, nearby grocery stores—stock the fresh vegetables and food that—(applause)—in fact, deal with—I mean, these are all things we can do.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off with these investments? The rich will be just as well off. The middle class will do better, and everybody will do better. It’s about good-paying jobs, financial stability, and being able to build some generational wealth. It’s about economic growth for our country and outcompeting the rest of the world, which is now outcompeting us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut just as fundamental as any of these investments I’ve discussed—this may be the most fundamental: the right to vote. (Applause.) The right to vote. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of the members of the Black Caucus knew John Lewis better than I did, but I knew him. On his deathbed, like many, I called John, to speak to him. But all John wanted to do was talk about how I was doing. He died, I think, about 25 hours later. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut you know what John said? He called the right to vote “precious,” “almost sacred.” He said, “The most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society”.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sacred right is under assault with an incredible intensity like I’ve never seen—even though I got started as a public defender and a civil rights lawyer—with an intensity and an aggressiveness that we have not seen in a long, long time. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s simply un-American. It is not, however, sadly, unprecedented. The creed “We Shall Overcome” is a longtime mainstay of the Civil Rights Movement, as Jesse Jackson can tell you better than anybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe obstacle to proc-—to progress that have to be overcome are a constant challenge. We saw it in the ‘60s, but with the current assault, it’s not just an echo of a distant history. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2020, we faced a tireless assault on the right to vote: restrictive laws, lawsuits, threats of intimidation, voter purges, and more. We resolved to overcome it all, and we did. More Americans voted in the last election than any—in the midst of a pandemic—than any election in American history. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nYou got voters registered. You got voters to the polls. The rule of law held. Democracy prevailed. We overcame. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut today, let me be unequivocal: I’ve been engaged in this work my whole career, and we’re going to be ramping up our efforts to overcome again. \\r\\n\\r\\nI will have more to say about this at a later date—the truly unprecedented assault on our democracy, an effort to replace nonpartisan election administrators and to intimidate those charged with tallying and reporting the election results. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut today, as for the act of voting itself, I urge voting rights groups in this country to begin to redouble their efforts now to register and educate voters. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in June—June should be a month of action on Capitol Hill. I hear all the folks on TV saying, “Why doesn’t Biden get this done?” Well, because Biden only has a majority of, effectively, four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate, with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut we’re not giving up. Earlier this year, the House of Representatives passed For the People Act to protect our democracy. The Senate will take it up later this month, and I’m going to fight like heck with every tool at my disposal for its passage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe House is also working on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which is—which is critical—(applause)—to providing new legal tools to combat the new assault on the right to vote. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo signify the importance of our efforts, today I’m asking Vice President Harris to help these efforts and lead them, among her many other responsibilities. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith her leadership and your support, we’re going to overcome again, I promise you. But it’s going to take a hell of a lot of work. (Applause.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd finally, we have to—and finally, we must address what remains the stain on the soul of America. What happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and domestic terrorism with a through line that exists today still. \\r\\n\\r\\nJust close your eyes and remember what you saw in Charlottesville four years ago on television. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, the KKK coming out of those fields at night in Virginia with lighted torches—the veins bulging on their—as they were screaming. Remember? Just close your eyes and picture what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, Mother Fletcher said when she saw the insurrection at the Capitol on January the 9th [6th], it broke her heart—a mob of violent white extremists—thugs. Said it reminded her what happened here in Greenwood 100 years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook around at the various hate crimes against Asian Americans and Jewish Americans. Hate that never goes away. Hate only hides.\\r\\n\\r\\nJesse, I think I mentioned this to you. I thought, after you guys pushed through, with Dr. King, the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act—I thought we moved. But what I didn’t realize—I thought we had made enormous progress, and I was so proud to be a little part of it. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut you know what, Rev? I didn’t realize hate is never defeated; it only hides. It hides. And given a little bit of oxygen—just a little bit oxygen—by its leaders, it comes out of there from under the rock like it was happening again, as if it never went away. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, folks, we can’t—we must not give hate a safe harbor. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs I said in my address to the joint session of Congress: According to the intelligence community, terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today. Not ISIS, not al Qaeda—white supremacists. (Applause.) That’s not me; that’s the intelligence community under both Trump and under my administration. \\r\\n\\r\\nTwo weeks ago, I signed into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which the House had passed and the Senate. My administration will soon lay out our broader strategy to counter domestic terrorism and the violence driven by the most heinous hate crimes and other forms of vigorty [sic]—of bigotry. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut I’m going to close where I started. To Mother Randle, Mother Fletcher, Mr. Van Ellis, to the descendants, and to all survivors: Thank you. Thank you for giving me the honor of being able to spend some time with you earlier today. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for your commitment. And thank your children, and your grandchildren, and your unc-—and your nieces and your nephews. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo see and learn from you is a gift—a genuine gift. Dr. John Hope Franklin, one of America’s greatest historians—Tulsa’s proud son, whose father was a Greenwood survivor—said, and I quote, “Whatever you do, it must be done in the spirit of goodwill and mutual respect and even love. How else can we overcome the past and be worthy of our forebearers and face the future with confidence and with hope?”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this sacred and solemn day, may we find that distinctly Greenwood spirit that defines the American spirit—the spirit that gives me so much confidence and hope for the future; that helps us see, face to face; a spirit that helps us know fully who we are and who we can be as a people and as a nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve never been more optimistic about the future than I am today. I mean that. And the reason is because of this new generation of young people. They’re the best educated, they’re the least prejudiced, the most open generation in American history. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd although I have no scientific basis of what I’m about to say, but those of you who are over 50—how often did you ever see—how often did you ever see advertisements on television with Black and white couples? Not a joke. \\r\\n\\r\\nI challenge you—find today, when you turn on the stations—sit on one station for two hours. And I don’t know how many commercials you’ll see—eight to five—two to three out of five have mixed-race couples in them. That’s not by accident. They’re selling soap, man. (Laughter.) Not a joke. \\r\\n\\r\\nRemember ol’ Pat Caddell? He used to say, “You want to know what’s happening in American culture? Watch advertising, because they want to sell what they have.” \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have hope in folks like you, honey. I really mean it. We have hope. But we’ve got to give them support. We have got to give them the backbone to do what we know has to be done. Because I doubt whether any of you would be here if you didn’t care deeply about this. You sure in the devil didn’t come to hear me speak. (Laughter.) \\r\\n\\r\\nBut I really mean it. I really mean it. Let’s not give up, man. Let’s not give up. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the old saying goes, “Hope springs eternal.” I know we’ve talked a lot about famous people, but I’m—my colleagues in the Senate used to kid me because I was always quoting Irish poets. They think I did it because I’m Irish. They think I did it because we Irish—we have a little chip on our shoulder. A little bit, sometimes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s not why I did it; I did it because they’re the best poets in the world. (Laughter.) You can smile, it’s okay. It’s true. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a famous poet who wrote a poem called “The Cure at Troy”—Seamus Heaney. And there is a stanza in it that I think is the definition of what I think should be our call today for young people. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt said, “History teaches us not to hope on this side of the grave, but then, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice rises up, and hope and history rhyme.” \\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s make it rhyme. Thank you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"June 1, 2021: Remarks Commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre\"},{\"doc_name\":\"march-1-2022-state-union-address\",\"date\":\"2022-03-02\",\"transcript\":\"SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NANCY PELOSI: Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\r\\n\\r\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\r\\n\\r\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees, teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlease rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people. \\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout our history, we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThey keep moving.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States is a member along with 29 other nations. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters. \\r\\n\\r\\nPutin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did.   \\r\\n\\r\\nWe prepared extensively and carefully. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin. \\r\\n\\r\\nI spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe countered Russia’s lies with truth.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now that he has acted, the free world is holding him accountable. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever. \\r\\n\\r\\nTogether with our allies, we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPreventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble, making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.   \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime, no more. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe US Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd tonight, I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights—further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30 percent of its value. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia’s economy is reeling, and Putin alone is to blame. \\r\\n\\r\\nTogether with our allies, we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLet me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOur forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies—in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor that purpose, we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs I have made crystal clear, the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPutin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield, he will pay a continuing high price over the long run. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the history of this era is written, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake, now everyone sees it clearly. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe see the unity among leaders of nations and a more unified Europe, a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world, even in Russia, to demonstrate their support for Ukraine.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations, we stand with you. \\r\\n\\r\\nPutin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pandemic has been punishing. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more. \\r\\n\\r\\nI understand. \\r\\n\\r\\nI remember when my dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. \\r\\n\\r\\nI grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBecause people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did. \\r\\n\\r\\nFew pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHelped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads, and cut the cost of health insurance. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as my dad used to say, it gave people a little breathing room. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd unlike the $2-trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1 percent of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people—and left no one behind. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact—our economy created over 6.5 million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year than ever before in the history of America. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur economy grew at a rate of 5.7 percent last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn’t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the past 40 years, we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century. \\r\\n\\r\\nVice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America. \\r\\n\\r\\nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBecause we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well. \\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don’t fix that. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—the most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re done talking about infrastructure weeks. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re going to have an infrastructure decade. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world—particularly with China.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAs I’ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes—so every child—and every American—has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American—urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities. \\r\\n\\r\\n4,000 projects have already been announced. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America—we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe federal government spends about $600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s been a law on the books for almost a century to make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses. \\r\\n\\r\\nEvery Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut to compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet me give you one example of why it’s so important to pass it. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site.” \\r\\n\\r\\nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place, 10,000 new good-paying jobs. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives. \\r\\n\\r\\nSmartphones. The Internet. Technology we have yet to invent. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut that’s just the beginning. \\r\\n\\r\\nIntel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from $20 billion to $100 billion. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we will really take off. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Intel is not alone. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s something happening in America. \\r\\n\\r\\nJust look around and you’ll see an amazing story. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products “Made in America.” The revitalization of American manufacturing.   \\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. \\r\\n\\r\\nGM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year. \\r\\n\\r\\nPowered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.” \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s time. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.  \\r\\n\\r\\nInflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel. \\r\\n\\r\\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control. \\r\\n\\r\\nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up. \\r\\n\\r\\nLook at cars. \\r\\n\\r\\nLast year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo—we have a choice. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI have a better plan to fight inflation. \\r\\n\\r\\nLower your costs, not your wages. \\r\\n\\r\\nMake more cars and semiconductors in America. \\r\\n\\r\\nMore infrastructure and innovation in America. \\r\\n\\r\\nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America. \\r\\n\\r\\nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America. \\r\\n\\r\\nEconomists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.” \\r\\n\\r\\nI call it building a better America. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. \\r\\n\\r\\nSeventeen Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan: \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst—cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHe and his dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom. \\r\\n\\r\\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. \\r\\n\\r\\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDrug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does. \\r\\n\\r\\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent. \\r\\n\\r\\nSecond—cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit;  \\r\\n\\r\\nDouble America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  \\r\\n\\r\\nLower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again. \\r\\n\\r\\nThird—cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMiddle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7 percent of their income for care of young children.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMy plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAll of these will lower costs. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI’m not looking to punish anyone. But let’s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share. \\r\\n\\r\\nJust last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15-percent minimum tax rate for corporations. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSo that’s my plan. It will grow the economy and lower costs for families. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. And while you’re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMy plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. \\r\\n\\r\\nLowering your costs also means demanding more competition. \\r\\n\\r\\nI’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s exploitation—and it drives up prices. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000 percent and made record profits. \\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThat ends on my watch. \\r\\n\\r\\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.  \\r\\n\\r\\nRaise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut I also know this. \\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.  \\r\\n\\r\\nJust a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnder these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI know some are talking about “living with COVID-19.” Tonight I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. \\r\\n\\r\\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted, you have the highest degree of protection. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90 percent.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \\r\\n\\r\\nEven if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. \\r\\n\\r\\nSecond—we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed. \\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThird—we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again. People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.   \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with 75 percent of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77 percent, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, continuing this costs money. \\r\\n\\r\\nI will soon send Congress a request. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \\r\\n\\r\\nFourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve sent 475 million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we won’t stop. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\r\\n\\r\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\r\\n\\r\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\r\\n\\r\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\r\\n\\r\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. \\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve worked on these issues a long time. \\r\\n\\r\\nI know what works: Investing in crime prevention and community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \\r\\n\\r\\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? \\r\\n\\r\\nBan assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \\r\\n\\r\\nRepeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote—and to have it counted. And it’s under assault. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot let this happen. \\r\\n\\r\\nTonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. \\r\\n\\r\\nA former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public-school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the border and fix the immigration system. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours. \\r\\n\\r\\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. \\r\\n\\r\\nRevise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the US Chamber of Commerce. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s get it done once and for all. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdvancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.  \\r\\n\\r\\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery. \\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. \\r\\n\\r\\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care. \\r\\n\\r\\nThird, support our veterans. \\r\\n\\r\\nVeterans are the best of us. \\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same. \\r\\n\\r\\nHeadaches. Numbness. Dizziness. \\r\\n\\r\\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. \\r\\n\\r\\nI know. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut I’m committed to finding out everything we can. \\r\\n\\r\\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHe was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq. \\r\\n\\r\\nStationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields. \\r\\n\\r\\nHeath’s widow Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. He loved building Legos with their daughter. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body. \\r\\n\\r\\nDanielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe didn’t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she. \\r\\n\\r\\nThrough her pain she found purpose to demand we do better. \\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, Danielle—we are. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing we’re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers. \\r\\n\\r\\nI’m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd fourth, let’s end cancer as we know it. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you. \\r\\n\\r\\nCancer is the #2 cause of death in America—second only to heart disease. \\r\\n\\r\\nLast month, I announced our plan to supercharge the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMore support for patients and families. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\r\\n\\r\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\r\\n\\r\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can do this. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight, we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow is the hour. Our moment of responsibility. Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\r\\n\\r\\nWell, I know this nation. We will meet the test. To protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will save democracy. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life. \\r\\n\\r\\nBecause I see the future that is within our grasp. \\r\\n\\r\\nBecause I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we have faced into an opportunity. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo on this night, in our 245th year as a nation, I have come to report on the State of the Union. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd my report is this: the State of the Union is strong—because you, the American people, are strong. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are stronger today than we were a year ago. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we will be stronger a year from now than we are today. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we will, as one people. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne America. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States of America. \\r\\n\\r\\nMay God bless you all. May God protect our troops. \\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"March 1, 2022: State of the Union Address\"},{\"doc_name\":\"march-11-2021-remarks-anniversary-coronavirus-shutdown\",\"date\":\"2021-03-12\",\"transcript\":\"THE PRESIDENT: Good evening, my fellow Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I’d like to talk to you about where we are as we mark one year since everything stopped because of this pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year ago, we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked.\\r\\n\\r\\nDenials for days, weeks, then months that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, and more loneliness.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhotos and videos from 2019 feel like they were taken in another era. The last vacation. The last birthday with friends. The last holiday with the extended family.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it was different for everyone, we all lost something.\\r\\n\\r\\nA collective suffering. A collective sacrifice. A year filled with the loss of life — and the loss of living for all of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, in the loss, we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation, respect, and gratitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do. In fact, it may be the most American thing we do.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that’s what we’ve done.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve seen frontline and essential workers risking their lives — sometimes losing them — to save and help others. Researchers and scientists racing for a vaccine. And so many of you, as Hemingway wrote, being strong in all the broken places.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know it’s been hard. I truly know.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I’ve told you before, I carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans who have died from COVID to date. It’s on the back of my schedule. As of now, the total deaths in America: 527,726. That’s more deaths than in World War One, World War Two, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were husbands, wives, sons and daughters, grandparents, friends, neighbors — young and old. They leave behind loved ones unable to truly grieve or to heal, even to have a funeral.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I’m also thinking about everyone else who lost this past year to natural causes, by cruel fate of accident, or other diseases. They, too, died alone. They, too, leave loved ones behind who are hurting badly.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, you’ve often heard me say before, I talk about the longest walk any parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to his child’s bedroom to say, “I’m sorry. I lost my job. We can’t be here anymore.” Like my Dad told me when he lost his job in Scranton.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo many of you have had to make that same walk this past year.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou lost your job. You closed your business. Facing eviction, homelessness, hunger, a loss of control, and, maybe worst of all, a loss of hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nWatching a generation of children who may be set back up to a year or more — because they’ve not been in school — because of their loss of learning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s the details of life that matter most, and we’ve missed those details.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe big details and small moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeddings, birthdays, graduations — all the things that needed to happen but didn’t. The first date. The family reunions. The Sunday night rituals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s all has exacted a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us. For we are fundamentally a people who want to be with others — to talk, to laugh, to hug, to hold one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this virus has kept us apart.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrandparents haven’t seen their children or grandchildren. Parents haven’t seen their kids. Kids haven’t seen their friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe things we used to do that always filled us with joy have become the things we couldn’t do and broke our hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo often, we’ve turned against one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nA mask — the easiest thing to do to save lives — sometimes it divides us.\\r\\n\\r\\nStates pitted against one other instead of working with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nVicious hate crimes against Asian Americans, who have been attacked, harassed, blamed, and scapegoated. At this very moment, so many of them — our fellow Americans — they’re on the frontlines of this pandemic, trying to save lives, and still — still — they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It’s wrong, it’s un-American, and it must stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, we know what we need to do to beat this virus: Tell the truth. Follow the scientists and the science. Work together. Put trust and faith in our government to fulfill its most important function, which is protecting the American people — no function more important.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need to remember the government isn’t some foreign force in a distant capital. No, it’s us. All of us. “We the People.” For you and I, that America thrives when we give our hearts, when we turn our hands to common purpose. And right now, my friends, we are doing just that. And I have to say, as your President, I am grateful to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast summer, I was in Philadelphia, and I met a small-business owner — a woman. I asked her — I said, “What do you need most?” I’ll never forget what she said to me. She said — looking me in the eye, she said, “I just want the truth. The truth. Just tell me the truth.” Think of that.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, you’re owed nothing less than the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for all of you asking when things will get back to normal, here is the truth: The only way to get our lives back, to get our economy back on track is to beat the virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou’ve been hearing me say that for — while I was running and the last 50 days I’ve been President. But this is one of the most complex operations we’ve under- — ever undertaken as a nation in a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why I’m using every power I have as President of the United States to put us on a war footing to get the job done. It sounds like hyperbole, but I mean it: a war footing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thank God we’re making some real progress now.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn my first full day in office, I outlined for you a comprehensive strategy to beat this pandemic. And we have spent every day since attempting to carry it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo months ago, the country — this country didn’t have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or near all of the American public. But soon we will.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve been working with the vaccine manufacturers — Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson — to manufacture and purchase hundreds of millions of doses of these three safe, effective vaccines. And now, at the direction and with the assistance of my administration, Johnson &amp; Johnson is working together with a competitor, Merck, to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, which is one shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, just yesterday, I announced — and I met with the CEOs of both companies — I announced our plan to buy an additional 100 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. These two companies — competitors — have come together for the good of the nation, and they should be applauded for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s truly a national effort, just like we saw during World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow because of all the work we’ve done, we’ll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in America by the end of May. That’s months ahead of schedule.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’re mobilizing thousands of vaccinators to put the vaccine in one’s arm. Calling on active duty military, FEMA, retired doctors and nurses, administrators, and those to administer the shots.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’ve been creating more places to get the shots. We’ve made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one — any one of nearly 10,000 pharmacies across the country, just like you get your flu shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re also working with governors and mayors, in red states and blue states, to set up and support nearly 600 federally supported vaccination centers that administer hundreds of thousands of shots per day. You can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot, get your shot, never leave your car, and drive home in less than an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers all across America, located in underserved areas. And we’ve been deploying and we will deploy more mobile vehicles and pop-up clinics to meet you where you live so those who are least able to get the vaccine are able to get it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe continue to work on making at-home testing available.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’ve been focused on serving people in the hardest-hit communities of this pandemic — Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, what does all this add up to? When I took office 50 days ago, only 8 percent of Americans after months — only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 had gotten their first vaccination. Today, that number is [nearly] 65 percent. Just 14 percent of Americans over the age 75, 50 days ago, had gotten their first shot. Today, that number is well over 70 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the CDC — that came out on Monday, it means simply this: Millions and millions of grandparents who went months without being able to hug their grandkids can now do so. And the more people who are fully vaccinated, the CD [CDC] will continue to provide guidance on what you can do in the workplace, places of worship, with friends, and as well as travel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came into office, you may recall, I set a goal that many of you said was, kind of, way over the top. I said I intended to get 100 million shots in people’s arms in my first 100 days in office. Tonight, I can say we are not only going to meet that goal, we’re going to beat that goal. Because we’re actually on track to reach this goal of 100 million shots in arms on my 60th day in office. No other country in the world has done this. None.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I want to talk about the next steps we’re thinking about.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, tonight, I’m announcing that I will direct all states, tribes, and territories to make all adults — people 18 and over — eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me say that again: All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1. That’s much earlier than expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me be clear: That doesn’t mean everyone’s going to have that shot immediately, but it means you’ll be able to get in line beginning May 1. Every adult will be eligible to get their shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo do this, we’re going to go from a million shots a day that I promised in December, before I was sworn in, to maintaining — beating our current pace of two million shots a day, outpacing the rest of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, at the time when every adult is eligible in May, we will launch, with our partners, new tools to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot, including a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you. No more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirdly, with the passage of the American Rescue Plan — and I thank again the House and Senate for passing it — and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff, including bus drivers, we can accelerate the massive, nationwide effort to reopen our schools safely and meet my goal, that I stated at the same time about 100 million shots, of opening the majority of K-8 schools in my first 100 days in office. This is going to be the number one priority of my new Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth, in the coming weeks, we will issue further guidance on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated, to lessen the confusion, to keep people safe, and encourage more people to get vaccinated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd finally, fifth, and maybe most importantly: I promise I will do everything in my power, I will not relent until we beat this virus, but I need you, the American people. I need you. I need every American to do their part. And that’s not hyperbole. I need you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI need you to get vaccinated when it’s your turn and when you can find an opportunity, and to help your family and friends and neighbors get vaccinated as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause here’s the point: If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the 4th, there’s a good chance you, your families, and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbeque and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn’t mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this long hard year, that will make this Independence Day something truly special, where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to get there, we can’t let our guard down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis fight is far from order — from over. As I told the woman in Pennsylvania, “I will tell you the truth.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA July 4th with your loved ones is the goal. But a goal — a lot can happen; conditions can change.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientists have made clear that things may get worse again as new variants of the virus spread.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’ve got work to do to ensure everyone has confidence in the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccines.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo my message to you is this: Listen to Dr. Fauci, one of the most distinguished and trusted voices in the world. He has assured us the vaccines are safe. They underwent rigorous scientific review. I know they’re safe. Vice President Harris and I know they’re safe. That’s why we got the vaccine publicly in front of cameras so — for the world to see, so you could see us do it. The First Lady and the Second Gentleman also got vaccinated.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalk to your family, your friends, your neighbors — the people you know best who’ve gotten the vaccine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need everyone to get vaccinated. We need everyone to keep washing their hands, stay socially distanced, and keep wearing the masks as recommended by the CDC.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause even if we devote every resource we have, beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd national unity isn’t just how politics and politicians vote in Washington or what the loudest voices say on cable or online. Unity is what we do together as fellow Americans. Because if we don’t stay vigilant and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track. And, please, we don’t want to do again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve made so much progress. This is not the time to let up. Just as we are emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ll close with this.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve lost so much over the last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve lost family and friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve lost businesses and dreams we spent years building.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve lost time — time with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd our children have lost so much time with their friends, time with their schools. No graduation ceremonies this — this spring. No graduations from college, high school, moving-up ceremonies.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, and there’s something else we lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe lost faith in whether our government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as I stand here tonight, we’re proving once again something I have said time and time again until they’re probably tired of hearing me say it. I say it foreign leaders and domestic alike: It’s never, ever a good bet to bet against the American people. America is coming back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development, manufacture, and distribution of the vaccines in record time is a true miracle of science. It is one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplished.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we also just saw the Perseverance rover land on Mars. Stunning images of our dreams that are now a reality. Another example of the extraordinary American ingenuity, commitment, and belief in science and one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd today, I signed into law the American Rescue Plan, an historic piece of legislation that delivers immediate relief to millions of people. It includes $1,400 in direct rescue checks — payments. That means a typical family of four earning about $110,000 will get checks for $5,600 deposited if they have direct deposit or in a check — a Treasury check.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt extends unemployment benefits. It helps small businesses. It lowers healthcare premiums for many. It provides food and nutrition, keeps families in their homes. And it will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts. And it fi- — and it funds all the steps I’ve just described to beat the virus and create millions of jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the coming weeks and months, I’ll be traveling, along with the First Lady, the Vice President, the Second Gentleman and members of my Cabinet, to speak directly to you, to tell you the truth about how the American Rescue Plan meets the moment. And if it fails at any pa-, I will acknowledge that it failed. But it will not.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout how after a long, dark years — one whole year, there is hope and light of better days ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we all do our part, this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school, and we will have proven once again that this country can do anything — hard things, big things, important things.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver a year ago, no one could’ve imagined what we were about to go through, but now we’re coming through it, and it’s a shared experience that binds us together as a nation. We are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by. But we’re also bound together by the hope and the possibilities of the days in front of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fervent prayer for our country is that, after all we have been through, we’ll come together as one people, one nation, one America.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe we can and we will. We’re seizing this moment. And history, I believe, will record: We faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this nation’s history — darkest we’ve ever known.\\r\\n\\r\\nI promise you, we’ll come out stronger with a renewed faith in ourselves, a renewed commitment to one another, to our communities, and to our country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the United States of America, and there is nothing — nothing — from the bottom of my heart, I believe this — there is nothing we can’t do when we do it together.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo God bless you all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd please, God, give solace to all those people who lost someone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd may God protect our troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for taking the time to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\nI look forward to seeing you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"March 11, 2021: Remarks on the Anniversary of the Coronavirus Shutdown\"},{\"doc_name\":\"march-25-2021-first-press-conference\",\"date\":\"2021-03-25\",\"transcript\":\"THE PRESIDENT: Please, please sit down. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Before I take questions, I want to make — give you a progress report to the nation on where we stand 65 days into office here on vaccinations and a few other top priorities for the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, on vaccinations: On December 8th, I indicated that I hoped to get 100 million shots in people’s arms in my first 100 days. We met that goal last week by day 58 — 42 days ahead of schedule.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, today, I’m setting a second goal, and that is: We will, by my 100th day in office, have administered 200 million shots in people’s arms. That’s right: 200 million shots in 100 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know it’s ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close — not even close — to what we are doing. And I believe we can do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd today, we’ve made a historic investment in reaching the hardest-hit and the most vulnerable communities, the highest-risk communities — as a consequence of the virus — by investing an addition $10 billion in being able to reach them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also set a goal, before I took office, of getting a majority of schools in K through 8 fully open in the first 100 days. Now, thanks to the enormous amount of work done by our administration, educators, parents, local, state education officials and leaders — a recent Department of Education Department survey shows that nearly half of the K-through-8 schools are open now full time, five days a week, for in-person learning. Not yet a majority, but we’re really close. And I believe, in the 35 days left to go, we’ll meet that goal as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of yesterday, more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people’s bank accounts. That’s real money in people’s pockets, bringing relief instantly, almost. And millions more will be getting their money very soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne final note: Since we passed the American Rescue Plan, we’re starting to see new signs of hope in our economy. Since it was passed, a majority — a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth that’s going to take place this year. They’re now projecting it will exceed 6 percent — a 6 percent growth in GDP.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd just this morning, we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100,000 persons. That’s the first time in a year the number has fallen below the pre-pandemic high.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo there are still too many Americans out of work, too many families hurting, and we still have a lot of work to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I can say to you, the American people: Help is here, and hope is on the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I’ll be happy to take your questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nZeke, the Associated Press.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I’d like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff, united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I’m going to — look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: I got elected to solve problems. And the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that’s why I put all my focus in the beginning — there are a lot of problems — put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the other problems we’re talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they’ve been around a long time. And what we’re going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and — whether it’s immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they’re going to lose a family member, whether they’re going to be in a position where they’re not going to be — they’re going to lose their home because they can’t pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to — to pay their rent.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we’re going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. But that’s the reason why I focused as I have.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here’s the deal: I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together, or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to — is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. But I’m not going to do that; I’m just going to move forward and take these things as they come.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  And just to — to follow up, Mr. President, can your presidency be a success if you can’t make progress on those four challenges: climate change, immigration reform, gun control, voting rights?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I plan on making progress on all of them, but that’s going to be for the American people to decide.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think — you know, I doubt whether — maybe you did; maybe others did. I thought — many of you thought there was no possibility of my getting the plan I got passed, passed, without any Republican votes. A pretty big deal. It got passed. Growing the economy. People’s lives are changing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo let’s see what happens. All I know, I’ve been hired to solve problems — to solve problems, not create division.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay. How about Yamiche?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Thanks so much, Mr. President. You’ve said over and over again that immigrants shouldn’t come to this country right now; this isn’t the time to come. That message is not being received. Instead, the perception of you that got you elected — as a moral, decent man — is the reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied minors.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow do you resolve that tension? And how are you choosing which families can stay and which can go, given the fact that even though, with Title 42, there are some families that are staying? And is there a timeline for when we won’t be seeing these overcrowded facilities with — run by CPB [sic], when it comes to unaccompanied minors?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I’m the nice guy; that’s the reason why it’s happening — that I’m a decent man or however it’s phrased. That — you know, that’s why they’re coming, because they know Biden is a good guy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe truth of the matter is: Nothing has changed. As many people came — 28 percent increase in children to the border in my administration; 31 percent in the last year of — in 2019, before the pandemic, in the Trump administration. It happens every single, solitary year: There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. That happens every year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to that, there is a — and nobody — and, by the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31 percent increase under Trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border? That’s not the reason they’re coming.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason they’re coming is that it’s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one. Number two, they’re coming because of the circumstances in-country — in-country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way to deal with this problem — and I started to deal with it back when I was a United States senator — I mean, Vice President — putting together a bipartisan plan of over $700 million to deal with the root causes of why people are leaving.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat did Trump do? He eliminated that funding. He didn’t use it. He didn’t do it. And in addition to that, what he did — he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and — and has been — continued to be a problem for a long time. He, in fact, shut down the — the number of beds available. He did not fund HHS to get people to get the children out of those — those Border Patrol facilities where they should not be and not supposed to be more than a few days — a little while. But he dismantled all of that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so what we’re doing now is attempting to rebuild — rebuild the system that can accommodate the — what is happening today. And I like to think it’s because I’m a nice guy, but it’s not. It’s because of what’s happened every year.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me say one other thing on this. If you take a look at the number of people who are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back — are being sent back. Thousands — tens of thousands of people who are — who are over 18 years of age and single — people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. We’re trying to work out now, with Mexico, their willingness to take more of those families back. But we — that’s what’s happening. They’re not getting across the border.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd those who are coming across the border, who are unaccompanied children, we’re moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled, as I said. For example, of all the children who are coming across the border, over 70 percent are either 16 or 17 years old. We’re not talking about people ripping babies from mothers’ arms or little three-year-olds standing on the border. Less than — I think it’s one and a half percent fall in the category of the very young.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what we’re doing is we’re providing for the space, again, to be able to get these kids out of the Border Patrol facilities, which no child — no one should be in any longer than 72 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd today, I went to — for example, I used all the resources available to me, went to the Defense Department, and — and the Secretary of Defense has just made available Fort Bliss — 5,000 beds be made easily available. Five thousand beds on the Texas border.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we’re building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It’s going to take time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the other thing we’re doing, I might add — am I giving you too long an answer? Because if you don’t want the details —\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  (Inaudible.)\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, no, but I mean — I don’t know how much detail you want about immigration. Maybe I’ll stop there and fin- —\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  My follow-up question is: One, if you could talk a little bit about which families — why they’re being allowed to stay. The families that are being allowed to stay, why they’re being allowed to stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what Zeke was asking about, there’s — immigration is a big issue, of course, when it — related to the filibuster, but there’s also Republicans who are passing bill after bill, trying to restrict voting rights. Chuck Schumer is calling it an “existential threat” to democracy. Why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues including voting rights or immigration?\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Clyburn, someone who — of course, who you know very well, has backed the idea of a filibuster rule when it comes to civil rights and voting rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I’m going to deal with all of those problems. The question is, the priorities as they come and land on my plate.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s go to the first question you asked — the first of the second question you asked. And that is: What about dealing with families? Why are not — some not going back? Because Mexico is refusing to take them back. They’re saying they won’t take them back — not all of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re in negotiations with the President of Mexico. I think we’re going to see that change. They should all be going back, all be going back. The only people we’re not going to let sitting there on the other side of the Rio Grande by themselves with no help are children.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what we’re doing there, and it’s an important point to understand — I know you understand; I don’t mean to say it that way — an important point to focus on: The vast majority of people under the age of 18 coming to United States come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the United States — a mother, a father, a close relative, a grandmom or a grandpop.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was happening before is it was taking literally weeks and weeks, and maybe even months, before anybody would pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there. Well, we’ve set up a system now where, within 24 hours, there’s a phone call made as that person or that child crosses the border. And then a verification system is being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called or that is actually a mom, a dad, and/or a close relative. They’re establishing that right off the bat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it, in fact, is Mom or Dad, Dad says — to take the extreme case — “I got a birth certificate.” Then guess what? We’re getting that kid directly to that parent immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so that’s going to reduce significantly — there’s two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable, like being held at a Border Patrol station. One is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when a hearing can be held. The second way to do it is put them in a Health and Human Services facility that we’re occupying now — both licensed beds around the country that exist, as well as, for example, federal resources like Fort Bliss — to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while their fate is determined.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  And can you answer the filibuster (inaudible)?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Filibuster. Filibuster. You know, with regard to the filibuster, I believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago. And that is that — it used to be required for the filibuster — and I had a card on this; I was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them — that it used to be that, that from between 1917 to 1971 — the filibuster existed — there was a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster that whole time. Last year alone, there were five times that many. So it’s being abused in a gigantic way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, for example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are — are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote — like the basic right to vote. We’ve amended the filibuster in the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here’s the deal: As you observed, I’m a fairly practical guy. I want to get things done. I want to get them done, consistent with what we promised the American people. And in order to do that in a 50-50 Senate, we’ve got to get to the place where I get 50 votes so that the Vice President of the United States can break the tie, or I get 51 votes without her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, I’m going to say something outrageous: I have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate. So the best way to get something done, if you — if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to — anyway —\\r\\n\\r\\nI — we’re going to get a lot done. And if we have to — if there’s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we’ll have to go beyond what I’m talking about.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay. Hang on. Sorry. Oh, Seung Min — Ms. Kim.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Thank you, Mr. President, to follow up on the filibuster: So do you believe it should take 60 votes to end a filibuster on legislation or 51?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) If we could end it with 51, we would have no problem. You’re going to have to — the existing rule — it’s going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster, the existence of a filibuster.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it’s not my expertise, in what the parliamentary rules and how to get there are. But our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate, but in the meantime, we got a lot we can do while we’re talking about what we’re going to do about the filibuster.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me get here. Okay, Cecilia Vega.  \\r\\n\\r\\nQ  I’d like to circle back to immigration, please. You just listed the reasons that people are coming, talking about in-country problems, saying that it happens every year; you blamed the last administration. Sir, I just got back last night from a reporting trip to the border where I met nine-year-old, Yossell, who walked here from Honduras by himself, along with another little boy. He had that phone number on him —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Astounding.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  — and we were able to call his family. His mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not deporting unaccompanied minors like her son. That’s why she sent him alone from Honduras.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging — in saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process — encouraging families like Yossell says to come?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the idea that I’m going to say — which I would never do — “if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we’re just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side” — no previous administration did that either, except Trump. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why I’ve asked the Vice President of the United States, yesterday, to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in the first place. It’s because of earthquakes, floods. It’s because of lack of food. It’s because of gang violence. It’s because of a whole range of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat — when I was Vice President and had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children, I was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities to do things like — in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving is they couldn’t walk in the street because they were getting — their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, what I was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but I was able to say, “Okay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? I’ll put the lighting in.” We got a contractor. We got the type of lighting. We paid directly to the contractor; it did not go through the government. And violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. Fewer people sought to leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this hurricane occurred — two hurricanes — instead of us going down and helping in a major way, so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn’t have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing. We’re going to do a lot in our administration. We’re going to be spending that 700-plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat mother did not sit around with — on the kitchen table and say, “You know, I got a great idea: The way I’m going to make sure my son get taken care of is I’m going to put a…” — how old was he, or she?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  He’s — he’s nine. I also met a 10-year-old.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: A nine-year-old. “I’m going to send him on a thousand-mile journey across the desert and up to the United States because I know Joe Biden is a nice guy and he’ll take care of him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a desperate act to have to take. The circumstances must be horrible. So we can do something about that. That’s what the Vice President is going to be doing: what I did. When President Obama asked me to come and deal, I was in — I was in Turkey at the time, and he said, “You got to come home and take care of this.” So we put together a plan and it had an impact.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, the question here is whether — how we go ahead and do this; what we do. There’s no easy answer\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  A quick follow, if I may.  Do you want to see these unaccompanied minors staying in this country, or should they be deported eventually?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, the judgment has to be made whether or not — and in this young man’s case, he has a mom at home; there’s an overwhelming reason why he’d be put in a plane and flown back to his mom.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Final follow, sir. You mentioned circumstances that must be horrific. The Customs and Border Protection facility in Donna, Texas — I was there — is at 1,556 percent capacity —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yep.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  — right now, with mostly unaccompanied minors. There are kids that are sleeping on floors. They are packed into these pods. I’ve spoken to lawyers who say that they — some of these children have not seen the sun in days. What’s your reaction — what is your reaction to these images that have come out from that particular facility? Is what’s happening inside acceptable to you? And when is this going to be fixed?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Is — that’s a serious question, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it acceptable to me? Come on. That’s why we’re going to be moving a thousand of those kids out quickly. That’s why I got Fort Bliss opened up. That’s why I’ve been working from the moment this started to happen to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely — not just children, but particularly children — to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what’s happening.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is totally unacceptable.\\r\\n\\r\\nKen.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about Afghanistan. You face a May 1st deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from that country. As a candidate, in foreign affairs, you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars. Can you commit to the American people that by May 2nd the U.S. will no longer have forces in Afghanistan?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: The answer is that it’s going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline. Just in terms of tactical reasons, it’s hard to get those troops out. So, what we’ve been doing — what I’ve been doing and what Secretary Blinken has been doing — has been — we’ve been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have NATO Allies who have troops in Afghanistan as well. And if we leave, we’re going to do so in a safe and orderly way.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re in consultation, I said, with our allies and partners in how to proceed. And Secretary Blinken is meeting in Brussels this week with our NATO Allies, particularly those who have forces there.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd General Austin is — just met with Ghani and I’m waiting for the briefing on that. He is the — the “leader,” quote, in Afghanistan and Kabul. And there’s a U.N.-led process that’s beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people — how to end this war.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. But the question is: How and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by President Trump to leave under a deal that looks like it’s not being able to be worked out to begin with? How is that done? But we are not staying a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  You just said “if we leave.” Do you think it’s possible that we–\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: We will leave. The question is when we leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Do you — sorry — do you believe, though, it’s possible we could have troops there next year?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I — I can’t picture that being the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay. Kristen.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Thank you very much, Mr. President. Given the conditions that were just laid out at the migrant facilities at the U.S. border, will you commit to allowing journalists to have access to the facilities that are overcrowded moving forward?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I will commit when my plan, very shortly, is underway to let you have access to not just them, but to other facilities as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  How soon will journalists be able to have access to the facilities? We’ve obviously been allowed to be inside one, but we haven’t seen the facilities in which children are packed together to really give the American people a chance to see that. Will you commit to transparency on this issue, Mr. President?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I will commit to transparency, and — as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we are doing right now.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd one of the reasons I haven’t gone down — I have all my — my chief folks have gone down — is I don’t want to become the issue. I don’t want to be, you know, bringing all of the Secret Service and everybody with me to get in the way. So this is being set up, and you’ll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Okay. And just to be clear: How soon will that be, Mr. President?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don’t know, to be clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Okay. And do you bear responsibility for everything that’s happening at the border now? I hear you talking a lot about the past administration. You decided to roll back some of those policies, did you move too quickly to roll back (inaudible) policies?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: To roll back what? I’m sorry.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Did you move too quickly to roll back some of the executive orders of your predecessor?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: First of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all — did not slow up the amount of immigration — and there’s many people coming.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd rolling back the policies of separating children from — from their mothers, I make no apology for that. Rolling back the policies of “Remain in Mexico,” sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat and — I make no apologies for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became President that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. And so, I make no apologies for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  If I could just ask you about foreign policy, Mr. President. Overnight, we learned that North Korea tested two ballistic missiles. What, if any, actions will you take? And what is your red line on North Korea?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Let me say that, number one, U.N. Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested — number one. We’re consulting with our allies and partners. And there will be responses — if they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I’m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization. So that’s what we’re doing right now: consulting with our allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Just a very quick follow-up —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: You’ve only got another hour now, okay?\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Diplomacy: Can you define what you mean? And former President Obama warned the incoming President Trump that North Korea was the top foreign policy issue that he was watching. Is that how you assess the crisis in North Korea?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay. Hang on a second here, Kristen. Nancy, CBS.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to go back to voting rights. And as Yamiche mentioned, Republican legislatures across the country are working to pass bills that would restrict voting, particularly, Democrats fear, impacting minority voters and young voters — the very people who helped to get you elected in November.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre you worried that if you don’t manage to pass voting rights legislation that your party is going to lose seats and possibly lose control of the House and the Senate in 2022?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick. Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line, waiting to vote; deciding that you’re going to end voting at five o’clock when working people are just getting off work; deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s all designed — and I’m going to spend my time doing three things: One, trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the House, number one. Number two, educating the American public. The Republican voters I know find this despicable. Republican voters, the folks out in — outside this White House. I’m not talking about the elected officials; I’m talking about voters. Voters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so I am convinced that we’ll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. I mean, this is gigantic what they’re trying to do, and it cannot be sustained.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the House and the Senate, to keep that from — from becoming the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Is there anything else you can do about it besides passing legislation?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: The answer is “yes,” but I’m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  And then, on a related note, have you decided whether you are going to run for reelection in 2024? You haven’t set up a reelection campaign yet, as your predecessor had by this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) My predecessor need do [sic] — needed to. My predecessor. Oh God, I miss him.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Have you — have you —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, the answer is “yes.” My plan is to run for reelection. That’s my expectation.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  And then, on — on one other note, on bipartisanship: Your old friend, Mitch McConnell, says you have only spoken to each other once since you took office and that you have moved far left since taking office. Do you see it the same way he does? Have you rejected bipartisanship?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I haven’t at all. I’ve been meeting — when is the last time a President invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues? Everything from how we work — we’re working with a group of 20 members of the Senate right now and House on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chips and how we get ahead of the game, how we can work together. And we’re working together on a bunch of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, look, I know Mitch well; Mitch knows me well. I would expect Mitch to say exactly what he said. But this is a matter of making sure that — I would like Republican — elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is that I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I’m doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, unless Mitch says the last thing I did is — the last piece of legislation is so far left — well, then he ought to a look at his party. Over 50 percent of them must be over that edge as well because they support what I did.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay. Where am I here? Let me see. Kaitlan.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question for you, but first I’d like to follow up on a question from Yamiche, and that’s on the filibuster.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: That counts as a question, but go ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Okay. I’ll make it quick. It’s a quick question.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, no — you can.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Regarding the filibuster: At John Lewis’s funeral, President Barack Obama said he believed the filibuster was a “relic” of the Jim Crow era. Do you agree?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  And if not, why not abolish it if it’s a relic of the Jim Crow era?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let’s figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It’s been abused from the time it came into being — by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let’s deal with the abuse first.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  It sounds like you’re moving closer to eliminating the filibuster. Is that correct?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I answered your question.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  You also just made some news by saying that you are going to run for reelection.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I said, “That is my expectation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  So is that a “yes” that you are running for reelection?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Look, I — I don’t know where you guys come from, man. I’ve never been able to travel. I’m a great respecter of fate. I’ve never been able to plan four and half, three and a half years ahead for certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  And if you do —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: It —\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  If you do run, will Vice President Harris be on your ticket?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: I would fully expect that to be the case. She’s doing a great job. She’s a great partner. She’s a great partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  And do you believe you’ll be running against former President Trump?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, come on. I don’t even think about — I don’t — I have no idea. I have no idea if there will be a Republican Party. Do you? I know you don’t have to answer my question, but, I mean, you know, do you?\\r\\n\\r\\nI mean, look, this is — the way I view things — I’ve become a great respecter of fate in my life. I set a goal that’s in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about, which are hardworking, decent American people who are getting — really having it stuck to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to change the paradigm. I want to change the paradigm. We start to reward work, not just wealth. I want to change the paradigm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you notice — don’t you find it kind of interesting that my Republican friends were worried about that the cost and the taxes that had to be had — if there is any tax to be had, as they talk about it — in dealing with the — the act that we just passed which puts money in people’s pockets — ordinary people.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid you hear them complain when they passed close to a $2 trillion Trump tax cut — 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? Did you hear them talk about that all? I love the fact that they’ve found this whole idea of concern about the federal budget. It’s kind of amazing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the federal budget is saving people’s lives, they don’t think it’s such a good idea. When the federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans — 90 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars not paying a cent in taxes; reducing taxes to the point that people who are making — you know, if you’re a husband and wife, a schoolteacher and a cop, you’re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is — something is wrong. Their newfound concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m concerned — look, I meant what I said when I ran. And a lot of you still think I’m wrong, and I respect that. I said, “I’m running for three reasons: to restore the soul, dignity, honor, honesty, transparency to the American political system; two, to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class, hardworking people, and people struggling to get in the middle class. They built America, and unions built them.” The third reason I said I was running was to unite the country. And, generically speaking, all of you said, “No, you can’t do that.” Well, I’ve not been able to unite the Congress, but I’ve been uniting the country, based on the polling data. We have to come together. We have to.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, from my perspective, you know, it’s a — to me, it’s about just, you know, getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people — just hardworking people. People get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids, to be able have a little bit of breathing room, being able to have — make sure that they go to bed not staring at the ceiling, like my dad, wondering whether — since he didn’t have health insurance, what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick. These are basic things. Basic things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I’m of the view that the vast majority of people, including registered Republicans, by and large, share that — that same — that same view, that same sense of what is — you know, what’s appropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\nJustin. Justin Sink, Bloomberg.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about your relationship with China now that you’ve been in office for a couple months. There’s obviously the meeting in Alaska that was a little theatrical, and there’s the continued human rights abuses.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, today, I’m wondering: Are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on China? Are you considering banning imports of forced-labor products? And would you consider cutting off U.S. investment or Chinese access to international payment systems?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, they’re each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve known Xi Jinping for a long time. Allegedly, by the time I left office as Vice President, I had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had, because President Obama and the Chinese President Hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the President of the United States to spend time with the vice president of another country. But it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of China.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, I spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter — my interpreter and his — going into great detail. He is very, very straightforward. Doesn’t have a democratic — with a small “D” — bone in his body. But he’s a smart, smart guy. He’s one of the guys, like Putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can’t function in an ever — an ever-complex world.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were — his people were on call as well as mine, listening — we had a two-hour conversation. For two hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I’ve told him in person on several occasions: that we’re not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo, that we’ll have strong competition but we’ll insist that China play by the international rules: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we’re going to deal with China effectively, and we’re going to need three things to do that. I tell him, our people. First, we’re going to invest in American workers and American science. I said that all through the campaign and I say it again. And we’re — and I’m setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that, you know, back in the ‘60s, we used to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today, it’s 0.7 percent. I’m going to change that. We’re going to change that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields. And so what I’m going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the reasons why I’ve set up the — the PAB [PCAST] — the President’s board with scientists and the like, again — is we’re going to invest in medical research — cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, the things — industries of the future — artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech. And we’re going to make real investments. China is out investing us by a longshot, because their plan is to own that future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third — the second thing we’re going to do is we’re going to reestablish our alliances. And I’ve been very clear with him, it’s not anti-Chinese. And we’ve talked about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this — as a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine; we’ve been going close to an hour. I’m happy to go longer. But one of the things that I’m going to be doing, I’m going to be speaking with the 27 heads of state in Europe and very shortly — I think within the next hour or so. I don’t know the exact time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd earlier this month — and apparently it got the Chinese’s attention; that’s not why I did it — I met with our allies and how we’re going to hold China accountable in the region: Australia, India, Japan, and the United States — the so-called Quad. Because we have to have democracies working together.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore too long, I’m going to have — I’m going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so we’re going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules — to follow the rules — whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea, or their agreement made on Taiwan, or a whole range of other things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the third thing, and the thing that I admire about dealing with Xi is he understands — he makes no pretense about not understanding what I’m saying any more than I do him — I pointed out to him: No leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country. And I said as — “And, Mr. President, as I’ve told you before, Americans value the notion of freedom. America values human rights. We don’t always live up to our expectations, but it’s a values system. We are founded on that principle. And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we’re going to continue, in an unrelenting way, to call to the attention of the world and make it clear — make it clear what’s happening.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he understood that. I made it clear that no American President — at least one did — but no American President ever back down from speaking out of what’s happening to the Uighurs, what’s happening in Hong Kong, what’s happening in-country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s who we are. The moment a President walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world. It’s who we are.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I see stiff competition with China. China has an overall goal, and I don’t criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. That’s not going to happen on my watch because the United States are going to continue to grow and expand.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  All right. Just to follow up on the meeting of democracies: Is that where you expect, in a multilateral way, to make these decisions about sanctions? Or —\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, that’s not where I make the decision; that’s where I make sure we’re all on the same page. All on the same page. Look, I predict to you, your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded: autocracy or democracy? Because that is what is at stake, not just with China.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook around the world. We’re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. Will there be middle class? How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology and the environment? How will they do that? And are democracies equipped — because all the people get to speak — to compete?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is clear, absolutely clear — and most of the scholars I dealt with at Penn agree with me around the country — that this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you notice, you don’t have Russia talking about communism anymore. It’s about an autocracy. Demand decisions made by a leader of a country — that’s what’s at stake here. We’ve got to prove democracy works.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  And, Mr. President, sorry, I know you haven’t had a chance to address the tragedies in Georgia and Colorado. You had said to stay tuned for actions that you might take on gun control. Wondering if you’ve made a decision either about sending the manufacturer liability bill that you had promised on day one to Capitol Hill, or executive actions like going after ghost guns or giving money to cities and states to battle gun control.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: All the above. It’s a matter of timing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you’ve all observed, successful presidents — better than me — have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they’re doing — order it, decide and prioritize what needs to be done.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next major initiative is — and I’ll be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh, in detail — is to rebuild the infrastructure — both physical and technological infrastructure in this country — so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs. Really good-paying jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great Republican goal and initiative. I still think the majority of the American people don’t like the fact that we are now ranked, what, 85th in the world in infrastructure.\\r\\n\\r\\nI mean, look, the future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that are going to accommodate air travel, ports that you can get in and out of quickly, so businesses decide.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of you, if you were ever local reporters, and you found your governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community, what’s the first thing that businesses asked? “What’s the closest access to — access to an interstate highway? How far am I from a freight rail? Is the water — is the water available? Is there enough water available for me to conduct my business?” All the things that relate to infrastructure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have somewhere — I asked the staff to write it down for me, and they did — not for this, but for a longer discussion. We have somewhere, in terms of infrastructure — we have — we rank 13th globally in infrastructure. China is investing three times more in infrastructure than the United States is.\\r\\n\\r\\nBridges: More than one third of our bridges — 231,000 of them — need repairs. Some are physical safety risks or preservation work. One in five miles of our highways and major roads are in poor condition. That’s 186,000 miles of highway. Aviation: 20 percent of all flights — 20 percent of all flights weren’t on time, resulting in 1.5 million hours lost in production. Six to ten million homes in America still have lead pipes servicing their water lines. We have over 100,000 wellheads that are not capped, leaking methane.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are we doing? And, by the way, we can put as many pipefitters and miners and — to work capping those wells at the same price that they would charge to dig those wells.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, I — I just find it frustrated — frustrating to talk about.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast point I’ll make on the infrastructure — and I apologize for spending more time on it, but — is that if you think about it, it’s the place where we will be able to significantly increase American productivity, at the same time providing really good jobs for people. But we can’t build back to what they used to be. We have to build — the environment has — global warming has already done significant damage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe roads that used to be above the water level — didn’t have to worry about where the drainage ditch was — now you got to rebuild them three feet higher. Because it’s not going to go back to what it was before; it will only get worse, unless we stop it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s so much we can do. Look at all of the schools in America. Most of you live in the Washington area now. But in your hometowns — I don’t know where you’re all from — how many schools where the kids can’t drink the water out of the fountain? How many schools are still in the position where there’s asbestos? How many schools in America we’re sending our kids to don’t have adequate ventilation? How many homes, buildings, office complexes are wasting billions of barrels of oil over time because they can’t hold in the heat or the air conditioning because it leaks through the windows that are so porous and the connections? It’s amazing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo there’s so much we can do that’s good stuff, makes people healthier, and creates good jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I think that I got one more question here. Janet from Univision.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  Thank you, Mr. President. We, too, have been reporting at the border. And just like Cecilia, we ran into a pair of siblings who came in on Monday, who were detained by CBP — had the phone number for their mother who lives in the U.S.  We have contacted the mother. That’s the only way they know her kids are here because CBP, today, Thursday, has not contacted that mother. So when can we expect your promise of things getting better with contacting and expediency and processing?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, they’re already getting better, but they’re going to get real — they’ll get a whole hell of lot better real quick, or we’re going to hear of some people leaving, okay?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can get this done. We’re going to get it done.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a long meeting with the entire team and several Cabinet-level officers the other night. We’re going to be moving, within the next — within the next week, over 100,000 — I mean, 1,000 people out of the Border Patrol into safe, secure beds and facilities. We’re going to significantly ramp up. We’re already out there contacting everyone, from getting some of the employees at HHS — and there’s a lot of them doing other things — and move them into making those calls. We’re in a — we’re in the process of rearranging and providing for the personnel needed to get that done.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I admire the fact that you were down there; you’re making the calls yourself. It’s real.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next thing that has to happen though — as you well know has to happen — there have to be some certitude that this is the — actually mom, dad, or whomever. And there’s ways to do that. There’s ways to do that — a little bit like determining whether or not you got the right code for your credit card, you know? “What was your dog’s name?” kind of a thing. I’m being a bit facetious, but not really. And also seeking harder data, from DNA to — to birth certificates, which takes longer. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, I want to do this as quickly as humanly possible and as safely as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  As you well know, treating the root cau- — causes in Latin America doesn’t change things overnight. How do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U.S. when things will not get better in their countries right away?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I can’t guarantee that. But I know, you know, that old thing: The journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know as well as I do; you cover it: You have serious — it’s not like somebody at a sitting hand-hewn table in Guatemala — I mean, in — in somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe, saying, “I got a great idea. Let’s sell everything we have. Give it to a coyote. Have him take our kids across the border and into a desert where they don’t speak the language. Won’t that be fun? Let’s go.” That’s not how it happens. People don’t want to leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen my great grandfather got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, expectation was: Was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America? But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble. They didn’t want to leave. But they had no choice. So you got — we can’t — I can’t guarantee we’re going to solve everything, but I can guarantee we can make everything better. We can make it better. We can change the lives of so many people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the other thing I want to point out to you and I hope you point out: I realize it’s much more heart wrenching — and it is — to deal with a five- and six- and seven-year-old. But you went down there, and you saw: The vast majority of these children — 70 percent — are 16 years old, 17 years old, and mostly males. Doesn’t make it — that doesn’t make it good, bad, or indifferent. But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these God-awful facilities that are, really, little babies crying all night — and there’s some; that’s true. That’s why we got to act.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yesterday, I asked my team — both the director of the two agencies, as well as others — I asked them what would they, in fact — and I asked their opinion because they’re the experts — but I said, “Focus on the most vulnerable immediately.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there’s no reason why, in the next month, as people cross the border, that phone call can’t be made in the first 48 hours and begin.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ  If I may ask one last question: Have you had any talks with Senate Republicans who are threatening this administration with not considering the immigration legislation that was passed in the House until the situation at the border has been resolved?\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, because I know they have to posture for a while. They sort of got to get it out of their system. This is a — but I’m ready to work with any Republican who wants to help solve the problem and make the situation better.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, folks, I’m going. Thank you very, very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"March 25, 2021: First Press Conference\"},{\"doc_name\":\"march-26-2022-remarks-support-people-ukraine\",\"date\":\"2022-03-26\",\"transcript\":\"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, if you have a seat, be seated. (Laughter.) If you don’t, come up on stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you very much. It’s a great honor to be here. Mr. President, they tell me you’re over there somewhere. There you are. Thank you, Mr. President. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Be not afraid.” They were the first words at the first public address of the first Polish Pope after his election on October of 1978. They were words that would come to define Pope John Paul II. Words that would change the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Paul brought the message here to Warsaw in his first trip back home as Pope in June of 1979. It was a message about the power—the power of faith, the power of resilience, and the power of the people. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the face of a cruel and brutal system of government, it was a message that helped end the Soviet repression in the Central land and Eastern Europe 30 years ago. It was a message that will overcome the cruelty and brutality of this unjust war. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Pope John Paul brought that message in 1979, the Soviet Union ruled with an iron fist behind an Iron Curtain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a year later, the Solidarity movement took hold in Poland. And while I know he couldn’t be here tonight, we’re all grateful in America and around the world for Lech Wałęsa. (Applause.) \\r\\n\\r\\nIt reminds me of that phrase of philosopher Kierkegaard: “[F]aith sees best in the dark.” And there were dark moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen years later, the Soviet Union collapsed, and Poland and Central and Eastern Europe would soon be free. Nothing about that battle for freedom was simple or easy. It was a long, painful slog fought over not days and months, but years and decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we emerged anew in the great battle for freedom: a battle between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression, between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this battle, we need to be clear-eyed. This battle will not be won in days or months either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Mayor, members of the Parliament, distinguished guests, and the people of Poland, and I suspect some people of Ukraine that are here: We’re—(applause)—we are gathered here at the Royal Castle in this city that holds a sacred place in the history of not only of Europe, but humankind’s unending search for freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor generations, Warsaw has stood where liberty has been challenged and liberty has prevailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, it was here in Warsaw when a young refugee, who fled her home country from Czechoslovakia was under Soviet domination, came back to speak and stand in solidarity with dissidents.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer name was Madeleine Korbel Albright. She became—(applause)—one of the most ardent supporters of democracy in the world. She was a friend with whom I served. America’s first woman Secretary of State. She passed away three days ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe fought her whole life for essential democratic principles. And now, in the perennial struggle for democracy and freedom, Ukraine and its people are on the frontlines fighting to save their nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd their brave resistance is part of a larger fight for an essential democratic principles that unite all free people: the rule of law; free and fair elections; the freedom to speak, to write, and to assemble; the freedom to worship as one chooses; freedom of the press.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese principles are essential in a free society. (Applause.) But they have always—they have always been under siege. They’ve always been embattled. Every generation has had to defeat democracy’s mortal foes. That’s the way of the world—for the world is imperfect, as we know. Where the appetites and ambitions of a few forever seek to dominate the lives and liberties of many.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy message to the people of Ukraine is the message I delivered today to Ukraine’s Foreign Minister and Defense Minister, who I believe are here tonight: We stand with you. Period. \\r\\n\\r\\nToday’s fighting in Kyiv and Mariupol and Kharkiv are the latest battle in a long struggle: Hungary, 1956; Poland, 1956 then again 1981; Czechoslovakia, 1968. \\r\\n\\r\\nSoviet tanks crushed democratic uprisings, but the resistance continued until finally, in 1989, the Berlin Wall and all of the walls of Soviet domination—they fell. They fell. And the people prevailed. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut the battle for democracy could not conclude and did not conclude with the end of the Cold War.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the last 30 years, the forces of autocracy have revived all across the globe. Its hallmarks are familiar ones: contempt for the rule of law, contempt for democratic freedom, contempt for the truth itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, Russia has strangled democracy—has sought to do so elsewhere, not only in its homeland. Under false claims of ethnic solidarity, it has invalidated [invaded] neighboring nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutin has the gall to say he’s “de-Nazifying” Ukraine. It’s a lie. It’s just cynical. He knows that. And it’s also obscene.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Zelenskyy was democratically elected. He’s Jewish. His father’s family was wiped out in the Nazi Holocaust. And Putin has the audacity, like all autocrats before him, to believe that might will make right.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my own country, a former president named Abraham Lincoln voiced the opposing spirit to save our Union in the midst of a civil war. He said, “Let us have faith that right makes might.” “Right makes might.”  \\r\\n\\r\\nToday, let us now have that faith again. Let us resolve to put the strength of democracies into action to thwart the denigns [sic] of our—the designs of autocracy. Let us remember that the test of this moment is the test of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kremlin wants to portray NATO enlargement as an imperial project aimed at destabilizing Russia. Nothing is further from the truth. NATO is a defensive alliance. It has never sought the demise of Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the lead-up to the current crisis, the United States and NATO worked for months to engage Russia to avert a war. I met with him in person and talked to him many times on the phone. \\r\\n\\r\\nTime and again, we offered real diplomacy and concrete proposals to strengthen European security, enhance transparency, and build confidence on all sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Putin and Russia met each of the proposals with disinterest in any negotiation, with lies and ultimatums. Russia was bent on violence from the start.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know not all of you believed me and us when we kept saying, “They are going to cross the border. They are going to attack.” \\r\\n\\r\\nRepeatedly, he asserted, “We have no interest in war.” Guaranteed he would not move. \\r\\n\\r\\nRepeatedly saying he would not invade Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepeatedly saying Russian troops along the border were there for “training”—all 180,000 of them. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is simply no justification or provocation for Russia’s choice of war. It’s an example of one of the oldest of human impulses: using brute force and disinformation to satisfy a craving for absolute power and control.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s nothing less than a direct challenge to the rule-based international order established since the end of World War Two.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it threatens to return to decades of war that ravaged Europe before the international rule-based order was put in place. We cannot go back to that. We cannot.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe gravity of the threat is why the response of the West has been so swift and so powerful and so unified, unprecedented, and overwhelming.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift and punishing costs are the only things that are going to get Russia to change its course. \\r\\n\\r\\nWithin days of its invasion, the West had moved jointly with sanctions to damage Russia’s economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia’s Central Bank is now blocked from the global financial systems, denying Kremlin’s access to the war fund it stashed around the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve aimed at the heart of Russia’s economy by stopping the imports of Russian energy to the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, the United States has sanctioned 140 Russian oligarchs and their family members, seizing their ill-begotten gains: their yachts, their luxury apartments, their mansions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve sanctioned more than 400 Russian government officials, including key architects of this war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese officials and oligarchs have reaped enormous benefit from the corruption connected to the Kremlin, and now they have to share in the pain. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe private sector is acting as well. Over 400 private multinational companies have pulled out of doing business in Russia—left Russia completely—from oil companies to McDonald’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of these unprecedented sanctions, the ruble almost is immediately reduced to rubble. The Russian economy—(applause)—that’s true, by the way. It takes about 200 rubles to equal one dollar. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe economy is on track to be cut in half in the coming years. It was ranked—Russia’s economy was ranked the 11th biggest economy in the world before this evasion [sic]—invasion. It will soon not even rank among the top 20 in the world. \\r\\n\\r\\nTaken together, these economic sanctions are a new kind of economic statecraft with the power to inflict damage that rivals military might.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese international sanctions are sapping Russian strength, its ability to replenish its military, and its ability—its ability to project power. And it is Putin—it is Vladimir Putin who is to blame, period.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, alongside these economic sanctions, the Western world has come together to provide for the people of Ukraine with incredible levels of military, economic, and humanitarian assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the years before the invasion, we, America, had sent over $650 million, before they crossed the border, in weapons to Ukraine, including anti-air and anti-armor equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the invasion, America has committed another $1.35 billion in weapons and ammunition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thanks to the courage and bravery of the Ukrainian people—(applause)—the equipment we’ve sent and our colleagues have sent have been used to devastating effect to defend Ukrainian land and airspace. Our Allies and partners have stepped up as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as I’ve made clear: American forces are in Europe—not in Europe to engage in conflict with Russian forces. American forces are here to defend NATO Allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday, I met with the troops that are serving alongside our Polish allies to bolster NATO’s frontline defenses. The reason we wanted to make clear is their movement on Ukraine: Don’t even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have a sacred obligation—(applause)—we have a sacred obligation under Article 5 to defend each and every inch of NATO territory with the full force of our collective power.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd earlier today, I visited your National Stadium, where thousands of Ukrainian refugees are now trying to answer the toughest questions a human can ask: “My God, what’s going to happen to me? What’s going to happen to my family?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw tears in many of the mothers’ eyes as I embraced them; their young children—their young children not sure whether to smile or cry. One little girl said, “Mr. President”—she spoke a little English—“is my brother and my daddy—are they going to be okay? Will I see them again?” Without their husbands, their fathers, in many cases, their brothers or sisters who stayed back to fight for their country.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t have to speak the language or understand the language to feel the emotion in their eyes, the way they gripped my hand, and little kids hung on to my leg, praying with a desperate hope that all this is temporary; apprehension that they may be perhaps forever away from their homes, almost with debilitating sadness that this is happening all over again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I was also struck by the generosity of the people of Warsaw—for that matter, all the Polish people—for the depths of their compassion, their willingness to reach out—(applause)—opening their hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was saying to the Mayor they’re preparing to open their hearts and their homes simply to help. I also want to thank my friend, the great American chef, José Andrés, and his team who helped feeling [sic] those—(applause)—feeding those who are yearning to be free. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut helping these refugees is not something Poland or any other nation should carry alone. All the world democracies have a responsibility to help. All of them. And the people of Ukraine can count on the United States to meet its responsibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve announced, two days ago, we will welcome 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. We already have 8,000 a week coming to the United States of other nat-—nationalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll provide nearly $300 million of humanitarian assistance, providing tens of thousands of tons of food, water, medicine, and other basic supplies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Brussels, I announced the United States is prepared to provide more than $1 billion, in addition, in humanitarian aid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Food Programme told us that despite significant obstacles, at least some relief is getting to major cities in Ukraine, but not Metropol [sic]—no, excuse me, Mar-—not Mariupol, because Russian forces are blocking relief supplies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we’ll not cease our efforts to get humanitarian relief wherever it is needed in Ukraine and for the people who’ve made it out of Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding the brutality of Vladimir Putin, let there be no doubt that this war has already been a strategic failure for Russia already. Having lost children myself—I know that’s no solace to the people who’ve lost family.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he, Putin, thought Ukrainians would roll over and not fight. Not much of a student of history. Instead, Russian forces have met their match with brave and stiff Ukrainian resistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nRather than breaking Ukrainian resolve, Russia’s brutal tactics have strengthened the resolve. \\r\\n\\r\\nRather than driving NATO apart, the West is now stronger and more united than it has ever been. \\r\\n\\r\\nRussia wanted less of a NATO presence on its border, but now he has [we have] a stronger presence, a larger presence, with over a hundred thousand American troops here, along with all the other members of NATO.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact—(applause)—Russia has managed to cause something I’m sure he never intended: The democracies of the world are revitalized with purpose and unity found in months that we’d once taken years to accomplish.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s not only Russia’s actions in Ukraine that are reminding us of democracy’s blessing. It’s our own country—his own country, the Kremlin, is jailing protestors. Two hundred thousand people have allegedly already left. There’s a brain drain—leaving Russia. Shutting down independent news. State media is all propaganda, blocking the image of civilian targets, mass graves, starvation tactics of the Russian forces in Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it any wonder, as I said, that 200,000 Russians have all left their country in one month? A remarkable brain drain in such a short period of time, which brings me to my message to the Russian people:\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve worked with Russian leaders for decades. I sat across the negotiating table going all the way back to Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin to talk arms control at the height of the Cold War.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ve always spoken directly and honestly to you, the Russian people. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet me say this, if you’re able to listen: You, the Russian people, are not our enemy. \\r\\n\\r\\nI refuse to believe that you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents or that you accept hospitals, schools, maternity wards that, for God’s sake, are being pummeled with Russian missiles and bombs; or cities being surrounded so that civilians cannot flee; supplies cut off and attempting to starve Ukrainians into submission. \\r\\n\\r\\nMillions of families are being driven from their homes, including half of all Ukraine’s children. These are not the actions of a great nation. \\r\\n\\r\\nOf all people, you, the Russian people, as well as all people across Europe, still have the memory of being in a similar situation in the late thirties and forties—the situation of World War Two—still fresh in the minds of many grandparents in the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat—whatever your generation experienced—whether it experienced the Siege of Leningrad or heard about it from your parents and grandparents—train stations overflowing with terrified families fleeing their homes; nights sheltering in basements and cellars; mornings sitting through the rubble in your homes—these are not memories of the past. Not anymore. Because it’s exactly what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine right now. \\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 26, 2022. Just days before—we’re at the twenty-fir-—you were a 21st century nation with hopes and dreams that people all over the world have for themselves and their family. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Vladimir Putin’s aggression have cut you, the Russian people, off from the rest of the world, and it’s taking Russia back to the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not who you are. This is not the future reserve—you deserve for your families and your children. I’m telling you the truth: This war is not worthy of you, the Russian people.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutin can and must end this war. The American people stand with you and the brave citizens of Ukraine who want peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd my message to the rest of Europe: This new battle for freedom has already made a few things crystal clear. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, Europe must end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. And we, the United States, will help. That’s why just yesterday, in Brussels, I announced a plan with the President of the European Commission to get Europe through the immediate energy crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the long term, as a matter of economic security and national security and for the survivability of the planet, we all need to move as quickly as possible to clean, renewable energy. And we’ll work together to help get that done so that the days of any nation being subject to the whims of a tyrant for its energy needs are over. They must end. They must end.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd second, we have to fight the corruption coming from the Kremlin to give the Russian people a fair chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd finally, and most urgently, we maintain absolute unity—we must—among the world’s democracies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s not enough to speak with rhetorical flourish, of ennobling words of democracy, of freedom, equality, and liberty. All of us, including here in Poland, must do the hard work of democracy each and every day. My country as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why—(applause)—that’s why I came to Europe again this week with a clear and determined message for NATO, for the G7, for the European Union, for all freedom-loving nations: We must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul. We must remain unified today and tomorrow and the day after and for the years and decades to come. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt will not be easy. There will be costs. But it’s a price we have to pay. Because the darkness that drives autocracy is ultimately no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls of free people everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime and again, history shows that it’s from the darkest moments that the greatest progress follows. And history shows this is the task of our time, the task of this generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s remember: The hammer blow that brought down the Berlin Wall, the might that lifted the Iron Curtain were not the words of a single leader; it was the people of Europe who, for decades, fought to free themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir sheer bravery opened the border between Austria and Hungary for the Pan-European Picnic. They joined hands for the Baltic Way. They stood for Solidarity here in Poland. And together, it was an unmistakable and undeniable force of the people that the Soviet Union could not withstand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’re seeing it once again today with the brave Ukrainian people, showing that their power of many is greater than the will of any one dictator. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, in this hour, let the words of Pope John Paul burn as brightly today: “Never, ever give up hope, never doubt, never tire, never become discouraged. Be not afraid.” \\r\\n\\r\\nA dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people’s love for liberty. Brutality will never grind down their will to be free. Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia—for free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will have a different future—a brighter future rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom and possibilities. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power. \\r\\n\\r\\nGod bless you all. And may God defend our freedom. And may God protect our troops.  Thank you for your patience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"March 26, 2022: Remarks in Support of the People of Ukraine\"},{\"doc_name\":\"march-31-2021-announcing-american-jobs-plan\",\"date\":\"2021-03-31\",\"transcript\":\"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) (Inaudible) Mike asked me — and I said to Bobby, my good friend — he asked me back there — he said, “Do you ever get nervous?” And I — he said, “Because I got up this morning, made breakfast for my kids. I’ve got to introduce the President.’” \\r\\n \\r\\nAnd what I say to you, Mike: You did a heck of a job. But I’d get nervous if I had to get up in the middle of the night, climb up a telephone pole, replace — in the middle of a storm — a connection that knocked out everybody’s electricity, and put a transformer in. That’s what would make me nervous. So what you did was really good. I couldn’t do what you do, pal. I couldn’t do what you do.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd I want to — and it’s true, Mike. You’re a union guy; me too. I got in trouble, but I don’t make any apologies for it. I’m a union guy. I support unions. Unions built the middle class. It’s about time they start to get a piece of the action.\\r\\n \\r\\nTo all my colleagues — (applause) — to the County Executives, to the Mayor, to everyone who’s here, I want to say: Thank you. Thank you, Congressman, for the passport into your district. And I appreciate being here. I’m honored to be with you.\\r\\n \\r\\nTwo years ago, I began my campaign here in Pittsburgh, saying I was running to rebuild the backbone of America. And today, I return as your President to lay out the vision of how I believe we do that — rebuild the backbone of America.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt’s a vision not seen through the eyes of Wall Street or Washington, but through the eyes of hardworking people, like the people I grew up with; people like Mike and his union family; union workers in this Carpenters Training Center; people like the folks I grew up with in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware. \\r\\n \\r\\nPeople who get up every day, work hard, raise their family, pay their taxes, serve their country, and volunteer for their communities, and just looking for a little bit of breathing room — just a little bit of light. \\r\\n \\r\\nOrdinary Americans doing extraordinary things. The people who break their necks every day for their families and the country they love — a country that, in fact — which, on the day I was elected, was in extreme distress with a virus on a deadly rampage that has now killed four thou- — excuse me, five hundred — I carry it in my pocket every day. I have the list of exactly how many have died: 547,296 Americans dead from the virus — more than all the people killed in World War One, World War Two, the Vietnam War, 9/11. 547,296 Americans. And an economy that left millions out of work and created so much anxiety. \\r\\n \\r\\nThat’s why I moved so quickly to pass the American Rescue Plan with the help of my friends here in the Congress. I really mean that. It didn’t pass by a whole lot, but with the leadership of Conor and Bobby and Mayor — just — you got it done, because it was an emergency. We needed to act to save jobs, to save businesses, and to save lives. And that’s what we did. \\r\\n \\r\\nWe’re beginning to see the results. We’re on our way to having given 200 million vaccination shots in the first 100 days of my presidency. When I said I’d get 100 million done, people thought it was a significant exaggeration. We’re going to get 200 million done — twice the original goal — because of all the help of all of you.\\r\\n \\r\\nLeading economists are now predicting our economy will grow 6 percent this year. That’s a rate we haven’t seen in years and years. We can cut child poverty in half this year. With the American Rescue Plan, we’re meeting immediate emergencies. Now it’s time to rebuild.\\r\\n \\r\\nEven before the crisis we’re now facing, those at the very top in America were doing very well, which is fine. They were doing great. But everyone else was falling behind. The pandemic only made the division so much worse and more obvious. Millions of Americans lost their jobs last year while the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans saw their net worth increase by $4 trillion. It just goes to show you how distorted and unfair our economy has become. It wasn’t always this way.\\r\\n \\r\\nWell, it’s time to change that. I’d note, parenthetically, that I got criticized for giving tax breaks to middle-class and poor folks this last time. I didn’t hear that cry — hue and cry when we were doing the same thing when Trump’s tax bill passed and 83 percent of the money went to the top 1 percent.\\r\\n \\r\\nYou know, this is not to target those who’ve made it; not to seek retribution. This is about opening opportunities for everybody else. And here’s the truth: We all will do better when we all do well. It’s time to build our economy from the bottom up and from the middle out, not the top down. It hadn’t worked very well. For the economy overall, it hadn’t worked — because Wall Street didn’t build this country; you, the great middle class, built this country. And unions built the middle class. (Applause.) \\r\\n \\r\\nAnd it’s time — in this time, we’ll rebuild the middle class. We’re going to bring everybody along. Regardless of your background, your color, your religion, (inaudible) everybody gets to come along.\\r\\n \\r\\nSo, today, I’m proposing a plan for the nation that rewards work, not just rewards wealth. It builds a fair economy that gives everybody a chance to succeed, and it’s going to create the strongest, most resilient, innovative economy in the world. It’s not a plan that tinkers around the edges. It’s a once-in-a generation investment in America, unlike anything we’ve seen or done since we built the Interstate Highway System and the Space Race decades ago.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn fact, it’s the largest American jobs investment since World War Two. It will create millions of jobs, good-paying jobs. It will grow the economy, make us more competitive around the world, promote our national security interests, and put us in a position to win the global competition with China in the upcoming years. \\r\\n \\r\\nIs it big? Yes. Is it bold? Yes. And we can get it done.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt has two parts: the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan. Both are essential to our economic future. In a few weeks, I’ll talk about the Americans Family Plan, but today I want to talk about the Americans Jobs Plan.\\r\\n \\r\\nI’ll begin with the heart of the plan: It modernizes transportation infrastructure — our roads, our bridges, our airports. I just left your airport. The director of the airport said, “We’re about to renovate the airport.” Is that right, Mr. County Executive? “We’re going to renovate. We’re going to employ thousands of people.” And she looked at me and said, “I can’t thank you enough for this plan.” \\r\\n \\r\\nIt grows the economy in key ways. It puts people to work to repair and upgrade so — that we badly need. It makes it easier and more efficient to move goods, to get to work, and to make us more competitive around the world.\\r\\n \\r\\nSome of your local officials know, when someone wants to come into the area and a company wants to invest, what do they ask? “Where’s the first rail bed? How can I get to the railroad? What access to interstate do I have? What’s the water like? Tell me about it.” And it goes on and on.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt’s about infrastructure. The American Jobs Plan will modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main streets that are in difficult, difficult shape right now. It’ll fix the nation’s 10 most economically significant bridges in America that require replacement. Remember that bridge that went down? We got 10 of the most economically significant bridges with more commerce going across it that need to be replaced.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe’ll also repair 10,000 bridges, desperately needed upgrades to unclog traffic, keep people safe, and connect our cities, towns, and Tribes across the country.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days. It’ll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe American Jobs Plan will lead to a transformational progress in our effort to tackle climate change with American jobs and American ingenuity. It’ll protect our community from billions of dollars of damage from historic super storms, floods, wildfires, droughts, year after year, by making our infrastructure more secure and resilient and seizing incredible opportunities for American workers and American farmers in a clean energy future. \\r\\n \\r\\nSkilled workers, like one we just heard from, building a nationwide network of 500,000 charging stations, creating good-paying jobs by leading the world in the manufacturing and export of clean electric cars and trucks. \\r\\n \\r\\nWe’re going to provide tax incentives and point-of-sale reberts [sic] — rebates to help all American families afford clean vehicles of the future. The federal government owns an enormous fleet of vehicles which are going to be transitioned to clean electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles right here in the United States, by American workers with American products.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen we make all these investments, we’re going to make sure, as the executive order I signed early on, that we buy American. That means investing in American-based companies and American workers. Not a contract will go out, that I control, that will not go to a company that is an American company with American products, all the way down the line, and American workers. \\r\\n \\r\\nAnd we’ll buy the goods we need from all of America, communities that have historically been left out of these investments: Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American, rural, small businesses, entrepreneurs across the country.\\r\\n \\r\\nLook, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes — where they get their water from — pipes that are lead-based pipes, including pipes for drinking water.\\r\\n \\r\\nAccording to scientists, there is simply no safe exposure to lead for a child. Lead can slow development, cause learning behaviors and hearing problems.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe American Jobs Plan will put plumbers and pipefitters to work, replacing 100 percent of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every American, every child can turn on a faucet or a fountain and drink clean water.\\r\\n \\r\\nWith each $5,000 investment replacing a line, that can mean up to $22,000 in healthcare costs saved — a chance to protect our children, help them learn and thrive. \\r\\n \\r\\nWe can’t delay. We can’t delay another minute. It’s long past due.\\r\\n \\r\\nYou know, in America, where the early interest was in Internet — this thing called the Internet that we invested — we invented, the early — the early Internet was invented here. Millions of Americans, though, lack access to reliable high-speed Internet, including more than 35 percent of rural America.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt’s a disparity even more pronounced during this pandemic. American Jobs will make sure every single — every single American has access to high quality, affordable, high-speed Internet for businesses, for schools.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd when I say “affordable,” I mean it. Americans pay too much for Internet service. We’re going to drive down the price for families who have service now, and make it easier for families who don’t have affordable service to be able to get it now.\\r\\n \\r\\nAs you saw in Texas and elsewhere, our electric and power — power grids are vulnerable to storms, catastrophic failures, and security lapses, with tragic results.\\r\\n \\r\\nMy American Jobs Plan will put hundreds of thousands of people to work — hundred of thousands of people to work — line workers, electricians, and laborers — laying thousands of miles of transmission line; building a modern, resilient, and fully clean grid; and capping hundreds of thousands of, literally, orphan oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up because they’re abandoned — paying the same exact rate that a union man or woman would get having dug that well in the first place.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe’ll build, upgrade, and weatherize affordable, energy-efficient housing and commercial buildings for millions of Americans.\\r\\n \\r\\nEven before the pandemic, millions of working families faced enormous — enormous financial and personal strain trying to raise their kids and care for their parents at the same time — the so-called “sandwich generation” — or family members with disability. You got a child at home, you can’t stay home from work to take care of that child unless you lose — you’re going to put the child at risk or you lose your job; or you have an elderly parent you’re taking care of. And seniors and people with disabilities living independently feel that strain as well. But we know, if they can remain independently living, they live longer.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe American Jobs Plan is going to help in big ways. It’s going to extend access to quality, affordable home or community-based care. Think of expanded vital services like programs for seniors, or think of homecare workers going into homes of seniors and people with disabilities, cooking meals, helping them get around their homes, and helping them be able to live more independently.\\r\\n \\r\\nFor too long, caregivers — who are disproportionately women, and women of color, and immigrants — have been unseen, underpaid, and undervalued.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis plan, along with the American Families Plan, changes that with better wages, benefits, and opportunities for millions of people who will be able to get to work in an economy that works for them.\\r\\n \\r\\nYou know, decades ago, the United States government used to spend 2 percent of its GDP — its gross domestic product — on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1 percent. I think it’s seven-tenths of 1 percent. \\r\\n \\r\\nHere’s why that matters: We’re one of only a few major economies in the world whose public investment in research and development as a share of GDP has declined constantly over the last 25 years. And we’ve fallen back. The rest of the world is closing in and closing in fast. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can’t allow this to continue. The American Jobs Plan is the biggest increase in our federal non-defense research and development spending on record. It’s going to boost America’s innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs — markets like battery technology, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy, the competition with China in particular. \\r\\n\\r\\nCritics say we shouldn’t spend this money. They ask, “What do we get out of it?” Well, they said the same thing when we first flew into space for the first time. They said the same thing. \\r\\n\\r\\nWell, pushing the frontiers led to big benefits back home. When NASA created Apollo’s digital flight control system — unheard of at the time — it led to technologies that help us today to drive our cars and fly our planes. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen NASA invented ways to keep food safe for the astronauts, it led to programs that have been used to — for decades to keep food safe in supermarkets. At least 2,000 products and services have been developed and commercialized as a result of American space exploration. \\r\\n\\r\\nGPS has helped us find each other. Computer chips allow us to see and talk to one another, even when we’re separated by mountains and oceans — singing “Happy Birthday” and watching the first steps of that new baby grandchild; comforting each other when comfort is needed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThink about what it means to you and your loved ones. We just have to imagine again. \\r\\n\\r\\nI had a long discussion with Xi Jinping, the leader of China, when he called to congratulate me. We spent two hours on the phone. And he said — and was astonished by NASA’s security team and the China experts who were on the line — he said, “You’ve always said, Mr. President, that you can define America in one word: possibilities.” That’s who we are. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn America, anything is possible. Like what we did with vaccines a decade ago that laid the foundation for COVID-19 vaccines we have today. Like we did when the Interstate Highway System that transformed the way we traveled, lived, worked, and developed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmericans could visit relatives anywhere in the country with just a family station wagon. Businesses here in Pittsburgh could load up a truck and get a product to Portland or Phoenix. To this day, about a quarter of all the miles Americans drive each year on one of those very original highways. \\r\\n\\r\\nImagine what we can do, what’s within our reach, when we modernize those highways. You and your family could travel coast to coast without a single tank of gas onboard a high-speed train. We can connect high-speed, affordable, reliable Internet wherever you live. \\r\\n\\r\\nImagine knowing that you’re handing your children and grandchildren a country that will lead the world in producing clean energy technology and will need to address one of the biggest threats of our time. That’s what we’ll do. \\r\\n\\r\\nAltogether, along with the American Rescue Plan, the proposal I put forward will create millions of jobs — estimated by some Wall Street outfits: over 18 million jobs over four years; good-paying jobs. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt also works to level the playing field, empower workers, and ensure that the new jobs are good jobs that you can raise a family on, and ensure free and fair choice to organize and bargain collectively. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why my plan asked Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act — the PRO Act — and send it to my desk. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis plan is important, not only for what and how it builds, but it’s also important to where we build. It includes everyone, regardless of your race or your ZIP Code. \\r\\n\\r\\nToo often, economic growth and recovery is concentrated on the coast. Too often, investments have failed to meet the needs of marginalized communities left behind. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is talent, innovation everywhere. And this plan connects that talent through cities, small towns, rural communities; through our businesses and our universities; through our entrepreneurs, union workers all across America. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have to move now. Because I’m convinced that if we act now, in 50 years, people are going to look back and say this was the moment that America won the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I’m proposing is a one-time capital investment of roughly $2 trillion in America’s future, spread largely over eight years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will generate historic job growth, historic economic growth, help businesses to compete internationally, create more revenue as well. They are among the highest-value investments we can make in the nation — investing in our infrastructure.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut put it another way, failing to make these investments adds to our debt and effectively puts our children at a disadvantage relative to our competitors. That’s what crumbling infrastructure does. And our infrastructure is crumbling. We’re ranked 13th in the world. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat’s more, it heightens our vulnerability to — it attac- — attracts our adversaries to compete in ways that they haven’t up to now. And our adversaries are worried about us building this critical infrastructure. \\r\\n\\r\\nPut simply, these are investments we have to make. We can afford to make them — or, put another way, we can’t afford not to. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo how do we pay for it? I spoke to the Majority Leader and — no longer — I guess he’s no longer the Majority Leader; he has been for a long time. I spoke for the Republican — I spoke to the Republican Leader about the plan. Everybody is for doing something on infrastructure. Why haven’t we done it? Well, no one wants to pay for it. \\r\\n\\r\\nLess than four years ago, as I said, the Congress passed a tax cut of $2 trillion, increasing the national debt $2 trillion. It didn’t meet virtually any of the predictions it would in terms of growing the economy. Overwhelmingly, the benefits of that tax package went to the wealthiest Americans. It even included new investments that would profit by shifting profits and jobs overseas if you’re a corporation. It was bad for American competitiveness, deeply unfair to the middle-class families, and wrong for our future.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, here’s what I’d do. I start with one rule: No one — let me say it again — no one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up. Period. This is not about penalizing anyone. I have nothing against millionaires and billionaires. I believe American — in American capitalism. I want everyone to do well. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut here’s the deal: Right now, a middle-class couple — a firefighter and a teacher with two kids — making a combined salary of, say, $110-, $120,000 a year pays 22 cents for each additional dollar they earn in federal income tax. But a multinational corporation that builds a factory abroad — brings it home and then sell it — they pay nothing at all. We’re going to raise the corporate tax. It was 35 percent, which is too high. We all agreed, five years ago, it should go down to 28 percent, but they reduced it to 21 percent. We’re going to raise it back to — up to 28 percent. \\r\\n\\r\\nNo one should be able to complain about that. It’s still lower than what that rate was between World War Two and 2017. Just doing that one thing will generate $1 trillion in additional revenue over 15 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2019, an independent analysis found that are 91 — let me say it again, 91 Fortune 500 companies — the biggest companies in the world, including Amazon — they used various loopholes so they’d pay not a single solitary penny in federal income tax. I don’t want to punish them, but that’s just wrong. That’s just wrong. A fireman and a teacher paying 22 percent? Amazon and 90 other major corporations are paying zero in federal taxes?\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m going to put an end to that, and here’s how we’ll do it. We’re establishing a global minimum tax for U.S. corporations of 21 percent. We’re going to level the international playing field. That alone will raise $1 trillion over 15 years. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll also eliminate deductions by corporations for offshoring jobs and shifting assets overseas. You do that, you pay a penalty; you don’t get a reward in my plan. And use the savings from that to give companies tax credits to locate manufacturing here — in manufacturing and production here in the United States. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’ll significantly ramp up the IRS enforcement against corporations who either fail to report their incomes or under-report. It’s estimated that could raise hundreds of billions of dollars. All of this adds up to more than what I’ve proposed to spend in just 15 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s honest. It’s fiscally responsible. And by the way, as the experts will tell you, it reduces the debt — the federal debt over the long haul.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut let me be clear: These are my ideas on how to pay for this plan. If others have additional ideas, let them come forward. I’m open to other ideas, so long as they do not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet me close with this: Historically, infrastructure had been a bipartisan undertaking, many times led by Republicans.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Abraham Lincoln who built the transcontinental railroad. Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican — the Interstate Highway System. I could go on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I don’t think you’ll find a Republican today in the House or Senate — maybe I’m wrong, gentlemen — who doesn’t think we have to improve our infrastructure. They know China and other countries are eating our lunch. So there’s no reason why it can’t be bipartisan again. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe divisions of the moment shouldn’t stop us from doing the right thing for the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nI’m going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office; listen to them, what they have to say; and be open to other ideas. We’ll have a good-faith negotiation with any Republican who wants to help get this done. But we have to get it done. \\r\\n\\r\\nI truly believe we’re in a moment where history is going to look back on this time as a fundamental choice that had to be made between democracies and autocracies. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou know, there’s a lot of autocrats in the world who think the reason why they’re going to win is democracies can’t reach consensus any longer; autocracies do. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s what competition between America and China and the rest of the world is all about. It’s a basic question: Can democracies still deliver for their people? Can they get a majority? \\r\\n\\r\\nI believe we can. I believe we must. \\r\\n\\r\\nDelivering for the American people is what the American Rescue Plan was all about. And it’s been overwhelmingly popular. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I wrote it, everybody said I had no bipartisan support. We’re overwhelming bipartisan support with Republican — registered Republican voters. And ask around. If you live in a town with a Republican mayor, a Republican county executive, or a Republican governor, ask them how many would rather get rid of the plan. Ask them if it helped them at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s what the American Jobs Plan is about — the new one I’m proposing. I hope Republicans in Congress will join this effort. I hope and I believe a number of businesses will join this effort. And I hope and believe the American people will join this effort — Democrats, Republican, and independents. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can do this. We have to do this. We will do this. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe just have to remember: This is the United States of America. And I’ve said it a thousand times: There’s nothing beyond our capacity if we act together. So it’s time to move together. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you and I hope I get to come back to see you folks after this plan is passed. And the question is: You have to attract even more apprentices, more people, because we’re building so much. \\r\\n\\r\\nGod bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you.

Uvalde, Texas. An elementary school. Beautiful, innocent second, third, fourth graders. And how many scores of little children who witnessed what happened see their friends die as if they’re on a battlefield, for God’s sake. They’ll live with it the rest of their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s a lot we don’t know yet, but there’s a lot we do know.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are parents who will never see their child again, never have them jump in bed and cuddle with them. Parents who will never be the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo lose a child is like having a piece of your soul ripped away. There’s a hollowness in your chest, and you feel like you’re being sucked into it and never going to be able to get out. It’s suffocating. And it’s never quite the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it’s a feeling shared by the siblings, and the grandparents, and their family members, and the community that’s left behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nScripture says—Jill and I have talked about this in different contexts, in other contexts: “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.” So many crushed spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, tonight, I ask the nation to pray for them, to give the parents and siblings the strength in the darkness they feel right now.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a nation, we have to ask: When in God’s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby? When in God’s name will we do what we all know in our gut needs to be done?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s been 340—3,448 days—10 years since I stood up at a high school in Connecticut—a grade school in Connecticut, where another gunman massacred 26 people, including 20 first graders, at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then, there have been over 900 incidents of gunfires reported on school grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Santa Fe High School in Texas. Oxford High School in Michigan. The list goes on and on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the list grows when it includes mass shootings at places like movie theaters, houses of worship, and, as we saw just 10 days ago, at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am sick and tired of it. We have to act. And don’t tell me we can’t have an impact on this carnage.\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent my career as a senator and as Vice President working to pass commonsense gun laws. We can’t and won’t prevent every tragedy. But we know they work and have a positive impact. When we passed the assault weapons ban, mass shootings went down. When the law expired, mass shootings tripled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea that an 18-year-old kid can walk into a gun store and buy two assault weapons is just wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat in God’s name do you need an assault weapon for except to kill someone?\\r\\n\\r\\nDeer aren’t running through the forest with Kevlar vests on, for God’s sake. It’s just sick.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the gun manufacturers have spent two decades aggressively marketing assault weapons which make them the most and largest profit.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor God’s sake, we have to have the courage to stand up to the industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere’s what else I know: Most Americans support commonsense laws—commonsense gun laws.\\r\\n \\r\\nI just got off my trip from Asia, meeting with Asian leaders, and I learned of this while I was on the aircraft. And what struck me on that 17-hour flight—what struck me was these kinds of mass shootings rarely happen anywhere else in the world. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhy? They have mental health problems. They have domestic disputes in other countries. They have people who are lost. But these kinds of mass shootings never happen with the kind of frequency that they happen in America. Why?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy are we willing to live with this carnage? Why do we keep letting this happen? Where in God’s name is our backbone to have the courage to deal with it and stand up to the lobbies?   It’s time to turn this pain into action.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor every parent, for every citizen in this country, we have to make it clear to every elected official in this country: It’s time to act.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s time—for those who obstruct or delay or block the commonsense gun laws, we need to let you know that we will not forget.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can do so much more. We have to do more.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur prayer tonight is for those parents, lying in bed and trying to figure out, “Will I be able to sleep again? What do I say to my other children? What happens tomorrow?”  \\r\\n\\r\\nMay God bless the loss of innocent life on this sad day. And may the Lord be near the brokenhearted and save those crushed in spirit, because they’re going to need a lot of help and a lot of our prayers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  God love you.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"May 24, 2022: Remarks on School Shooting in Uvalde, Texas\"},{\"doc_name\":\"november-15-2021-signing-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs\",\"date\":\"2021-11-15\",\"transcript\":\"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Joe!\\r\\n \\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) Well, thank you. Heather, you thought — you’re surprised you’re standing here. (Laughter.) Jill was very surprised I’m standing here. (Laughter.)\\r\\n \\r\\nWell, Heather, thank you for the introduction. And I can’t look over here because the sun is shining in my eyes, but all this other crowd over here — and thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’ve done. (Applause.)\\r\\n \\r\\nLook, thanks for sharing this day with us — why this day matters to you and our fellow — your fellow Iron Workers and your families. And you explained it well.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd for all the folks at home, I know this day matters to you as well. I know you’re tired of the bickering in Washington, frustrated by the negativity, and you just want us to use and focus on your needs, your concerns, and the conversations that are taking place at your kitchen table — conversation as profound as they are ordinary.\\r\\n \\r\\nHow do I find work? And how do I get there? How can our small business thrive and our child succeed in school? Or how do we emerge from this pandemic not just with a little bit of breathing room, but with a real fighting chance to get ahead?\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen we ran for President, to help — I thought maybe I could help answer some of those questions for you and the needs you have. Because every time I’d ride home on Amtrak, I’d go through just north of — just south of Baltimore. I’d look out as it would go through a suburban neighborhood. I’d look in those — all those lights were on in the windows, Nance, and I’d look and I’d wonder, “What are they talking about?” I’m serious. I swear to God. “What are they talking about sitting at that table? What are they talking about?”\\r\\n \\r\\nThey’re talking about the things that I talked about at our kitchen table, Jill at hers, and all of you as well. Ask about, “How can we come together to be President for all Americans, to make sure our democracy delivers for you, for all of you?”\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd I promised that we couldn’t just build back to what it was before. We literally had to build back better. You couldn’t build back — we’re the only country that’s always come out of great crises stronger than when we went in.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd the world has changed, and we have to be ready. My fellow Americans, today, I want you to know: We hear you, and we see you. (Applause.)\\r\\n \\r\\nThe bill I’m about to sign into law is proof that despite the cynics, Democrats and Republicans can come together and deliver results. (Applause.)\\r\\n \\r\\nWe can do this. We can deliver real results for real people. We see in ways that really matter each and every day, to each person out there. And we’re taking a monumental step forward to build back better as a nation.\\r\\n \\r\\nI want to thank everyone who helped make this happen: Vice President Harris, my Cabinet members, my White House team, Jill, Doug, our First Lady, and our — First Lady and our Second Husband. No, I’m joking. (Laughter.) These guys travel all over the country together. I’m getting worried, you know. (Laughter.) And Doug is one hell of a lawyer besides.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd everybody from the United States Senate — Majority Leader Schumer and a group of Senate Democrats and Republicans have established this bipartisan framework, including representatives and all the folks you heard from.\\r\\n \\r\\nSenator Rob Portman is a really — hell of a good guy. I — I’m not hurting you, Rob, because I know you’re not running again. (Laughter.) That’s the only reason I say it. But you are a hell of a good guy.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd the most determined woman I know: Senator Kyrsten Sinema. Congratulations, Kyrsten.\\r\\n \\r\\nLook, Committee Chair Tom Carper, Ranking Member Shelley Moore Capito.\\r\\n \\r\\nI also want to thank Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for voting for this bill and talking about how useful and important it is.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd from the House of Representatives: Speaker Pelosi — (applause); Steny Hoyer — (applause); Jim Clyburn — (applause); and Committee Chair Pete DeFazio. (Applause.) Democrats and Republicans. Progressives and moderates.\\r\\n \\r\\nI’d like to pause and ask all the committee chairs and ranking members of the United States Senate and House that are here today — please stand. Would all of you stand? Come on. (Applause.) All right. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\\r\\n \\r\\nTo state the obvious, none of this would have happened without all of you. I really mean it.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd also to the governors — where are the governors? Governors, stand up. Come on. I want you to stand up. (Applause.) Red states, blue states — you all contacted me. You all said you were for this. You all stepped up.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd more than 375 mayors — Democrats and Republicans — (applause) — from every state and District of Columbia wrote me asking to get this done.\\r\\n \\r\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)\\r\\n \\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: You got it, kid.\\r\\n \\r\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: You got it.\\r\\n \\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) And nearly 50 of whom are here today, including Republican mayor of Fontana who — from Calif- — from Fontana — from Calif- — Fontana, California, Mayor Warren, who spoke earlier.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd the county and state and Tribal leaders as well — civil rights leaders, faith leaders. Law — you know, this law was supported by business groups — the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; the National Association of Manufacturers; the Business Roundtable, representing 200 of the largest corporations in America and other top business.\\r\\n \\r\\nI want to especially thank — and I’m sure you all — as we used to say in the Senate –- I’d say, “a point of personal privilege” — I want to thank organized labor –- (applause) – who understand this about jobs. You all stood up. Jobs! Jobs! Jobs! Jobs!\\r\\n \\r\\nSpecial thanks to the AFL-CIO; the United Auto Workers; electric workers, the IBEW; the iron workers — it goes on — plumbers, pipe fitters, and the building trades, steel workers, mach- — who did I leave out?\\r\\n \\r\\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Inaudible.)\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.)\\r\\n \\r\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)\\r\\n \\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: Pardon me?\\r\\n \\r\\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)\\r\\n \\r\\nTHE PRESIDENT: And my wife is a member of a union, the NEA. (Applause.) I’m going to get in trouble.\\r\\n \\r\\nMachinists — so many more.\\r\\n \\r\\nLook folks, for too long, we’ve talked about having the best economy in the world. We’ve talked about asserting American leadership around the world with the best and the safest roads, railroads, ports, airports.\\r\\n \\r\\nHere in Washington, we’ve heard countless speeches and promises and white papers from experts. But today, we’re finally getting this done. (Applause.)\\r\\n \\r\\nSo my message to the American people is this: America is moving again, and your life is going to change for the better.\\r\\n \\r\\nIf you live in one of the top — if you live in one of the 10 million homes or your child attends one of the 400,000 schools or childcare centers that still has lead pipes in them, you face a clear and present danger to your child’s health and your health now.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis law is going to start to replace 100 percent of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines –- (applause) — so every American, every child can turn on the faucet and drink clean water. And tens of thousands of plumbers and pipefitters are going to get work done in good-paying jobs.\\r\\n \\r\\nFolks, as — as we saw with remote learning, remote working during the pandemic, access to high-speed Internet is essential — and access to water — as essential as access to water and electricity.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis law is going to make high-speed Internet affordable and available everywhere — everywhere in America — urban suburban, rural — and create jobs laying down those broadband lines.\\r\\n \\r\\nNo parent — no parent — (coughs) — excuse me — no parent should have to sit in a parking lot at a fast-food restaurant again just so their child can use the Internet to do their homework. That’s over. (Applause.)\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd, folks, if I visited your town, I’m sure you’d be able to tell me and — where you hold your breath as you cross the particular bridge or where the most dangerous intersection of your town is.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis law makes this the most significant investment in roads and bridges in the past 70 years. It makes the most significant investment in passenger rail in the past 50 years and in public transit ever.\\r\\n \\r\\nSo, what — what that means is you’re going to be safer, and you’re going to get there faster, and we’re going to have a whole hell of a lot pollution — less pollution in the air.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe bipartisan law will modernize our ports, our airports, our freight rail to make it easier for companies to get goods to market; reduce supply chain bottlenecks, as we’re experiencing now; and lower cost for you and your family.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe law also builds on our resilience so that the next storm — superstorm, drought, wildfire, hurricane — can be dealt with.\\r\\n \\r\\nLast year alone, the United States, as a consequence of these kind of extreme weather events, lost $99 billion in the United States alone in damage.\\r\\n \\r\\nAfter Hurricane Ida — I see the distinguished governor from Louisiana is over there; I saw him stand up — I went down to see him. We went through and saw all the damage there. They had 179-mile-an-hour winds at top speed in Louisiana.\\r\\n \\r\\nBut then I headed on up to New York — Chuck, up in your area — into Queens and New Jersey. More people died there than in a hurricane. More people died with the flooding.\\r\\n \\r\\nRecord wildfires raged and went — I went to Idaho and California and saw it. More land has burned to the ground than the entire state of New Jersey out west.\\r\\n \\r\\nFolks –- walk the neighborhoods and look the people in the eye in these circumstances, as many of you have, and you’ll see the despair and the heartache. So many of you understand; you’re living through it.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis law builds back our bridges, our water systems, our powerlines, our levees better and stronger so few Americans will be flooded out of their homes or lose power in those days and weeks that comes with the storms that hit.\\r\\n \\r\\nFolks, this bipartisan law, for the first time ever, creates a true national network of charging stations for electric vehicles — over 500,000 of them — (applause) — so you can charge your car here and drive all the way to California not worrying about having to find places to charge, creating thousands of jobs — thousands.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt is also going to make it possible for Americans to get off the sidelines and into the game of manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, batteries to store energy and power for electric vehicles, including electric school buses, which will mean millions of children will no longer inhale the dangerous diesel fumes that come out of the buses. (Applause.)\\r\\n \\r\\nFor real. It’s a big deal.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd it’ll reward companies for paying good wages and for buying American, sourcing their products here in America right now.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt’s going to help the United States export clean energy technologies to the world, creating mil- — tens of thousands of more jobs.\\r\\n \\r\\nThere’s so much more in the law, but, most of all, it does something truly historic.\\r\\n \\r\\nI ran for President believing it was time to rebuild the backbone of this nation, which I characterized as working people in the middle class — they’re the ones who built the country — and to rebuild the economy from the bottom up in the middle out.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis law delivers on that long-overdue promise, in my view. It creates better jobs for millions of Americans. And no one — no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a single penny in federal taxes because of it. (Applause.)\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd it does not include — as we did the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, it does not include a single penny in gas tax, which I rejected because people under $400,000 would be paying it.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis law is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. It leaves no one behind. And it makes — it marks an inflection point that we face as a nation.\\r\\n \\r\\nFor most of the 20th century, we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in ourselves. But somewhere along the way, we stopped investing in ourselves. We’ve risked losing our edge as a nation, and China and the rest of the world are catching up.\\r\\n \\r\\nOur infrastructure used to be rated the best in the world. Now, according to the World Economic Forum, we rank 13th in the world. Well, that’s about to change. (Applause.)\\r\\n \\r\\nThings are going to turn around in a big way. For example, because of this law, next year will be the first year in 20 years American infrastructure investment will grow faster than China’s. We’ll once again have the best roads, bridges, ports, and airports over the next decade. And we’ll lead the world into the 21st century with modern cars and trucks and transit systems.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe’re going to do this by building again and moving again.\\r\\n \\r\\nFolks, too often in Washington the reason we didn’t get things done is because we insisted on getting everything we want — everything.\\r\\n \\r\\nWith this law, we focus on getting things done. I ran for President because the only way to move this country forward, in my view, was through compromise and consensus. That’s how the system works. That’s American democracy.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd I’m going to be signing a law that is truly consequential because we made our democracy deliver for the American people. We compromised. We reached a consensus. That’s necessary.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd now, our focus moves to implementing an infrastructure law that’s going to — with speed and with discipline.\\r\\n \\r\\nI have a lot of experience in doing that. When I was Vice President, I was given responsibility for overseeing and implementing the Recovery Act, a nearly $900 billion emergency package.\\r\\n \\r\\nI’m proud to say that when we finished implementing that Recovery Act, it was determined that there had been less than two tenths of 1 percent waste, fraud, or abuse.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd I was — it was how I learned and earned the nickname\\r\\n“Sheriff Joe” from President Obama. Because I made it a point, every single day for well over a year, to stay on top of how the money was being used.\\r\\n \\r\\nI spoke with over 160 mayors — two, three times sometimes. And I spoke with county executives and every governor save one — I won’t mention that; save one — (laughter) — she could see Alaska from her porch, but — monitor what we’re doing, just how it was being done.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd it was one of the most efficient implementations of a major program in American history. And now we owe it to the American people to do the same thing again.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd to make sure every penny is spent where it’s supposed to go in a timely fashion, I’ve asked the former Mayor of New Orleans and former Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana, Mitch Landrieu, to oversee this responsibility. (Applause.)\\r\\n \\r\\nHe’ll have full access to every tool the federal government has to get it done. And we have — we have the high obligation and responsibility to make sure this money is used wisely and used well.\\r\\n \\r\\nFolks, I’ve been looking forward to this day for a long time like all of my colleagues here have.\\r\\n \\r\\nTomorrow, I’ll be traveling to New Hampshire to visit a bridge that is structurally not safe, like thousands of bridges across America. That’s what this law is all about: keeping communities safer and more efficient.\\r\\n \\r\\nOn Wednesday, I’ll be in Detroit to meet with the UAW workers who are building the next generation of electric vehicles. And that’s just the beginning.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe’re also seeing me and the Vice — you’ll be seeing me and the Vice President Harris, Jill and Doug, Cabinet officials hitting the road to help you understand how this is going to transform your lives for the better.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd, folks, when you see those projects start in your hometowns, I want you to feel what I feel: pride — pride in what we can do together as the United States of America.\\r\\n \\r\\nFolks, you know, the same goes for my plan to build back better for the people — getting folks back to work and reducing costs of things like childcare, eldercare, housing, healthcare, prescription drugs, and meeting the moment on climate change.\\r\\n \\r\\nI’m confident that the House will pass this bill, and then we’re going to have to pass it in the Senate. And it’s fully paid for.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt will reduce the deficit over the long term, according to leading economists in the world. And again, no one earning less than $400,000 will pay a single penny more in federal taxes.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd together — together with the infrastructure bill, millions of lives will be changed for the better.\\r\\n \\r\\nFolks, let me close with this: Throughout our history, we’ve emerged from crises by investing in ourselves.\\r\\n \\r\\nDuring and after the Civil War, it’s been referenced, we built the transcontinental railroad, uniting East and West and uniting America.\\r\\n \\r\\nDuring the Cold War, we built the Interstate Highway System, transforming how America lived their lives.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd now, we’re emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, and we’ll build an economy for the 21st century.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen I met with the President of China — who I’m going to be speaking with tonight — several years ago, he asked me — we were in China — he asked me — he said: Could I define America? And I said, “Absolutely.” It’s the God’s truth. I said, “Absolutely. I can define it in one word: possibilities. Possibilities.”\\r\\n \\r\\nThere is no limit to what our people think we can do. And there is no limit to what our nation can do. And there is no one thing that I know more than this: It’s never, ever been a good bet to bet against the American people. Never, never, never. (Applause.)\\r\\n \\r\\nGiven half a chance, the American people have never, ever, ever, ever let this nation down. And it’s our job to give our people that chance. It’s our job to come together and make sure we remain a nation of possibilities.\\r\\n \\r\\nAs I look out on this crowd today, I see Democrats and Republicans, national leaders, local leaders, all elected officials, labor leaders, business leaders, and, most of all, I see fellow Americans. I see America.\\r\\n \\r\\nLet’s remember this day. Let’s remember we can come together. And most of all, let’s remember what we got done for the American people when we do come together.\\r\\n \\r\\nI truly believe that 50 years from now, historians are going to look back at this moment and say, “That’s the moment America began to win the competition of the 21st century.”\\r\\n \\r\\nSo, with confidence, optimism, with vision and faith in each other, let’s believe in possibilities. Let’s believe in one another. And let’s believe in America.\\r\\n \\r\\nGod bless you all, and may God protect our troops. (Applause.)\\r\\n \\r\\nNow let me sign this bipartisan bill. (Applause.)\\r\\n \\r\\n(The bill is signed.) (Applause.)\\r\\n \\r\\nThank you, thank you, thank you. Thanks, everybody.\\r\\n \\r\\n4:21 P.M. EST\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"November 15, 2021: Signing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\"},{\"doc_name\":\"september-1-2022-remarks-continued-battle-soul-nation\",\"date\":\"2022-09-02\",\"transcript\":\"THE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans, please, if you have a seat, take it. I speak to you tonight from sacred ground in America: Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis is where America made its Declaration of Independence to the world more than two centuries ago with an idea, unique among nations, that in America, we’re all created equal.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis is where the United States Constitution was written and debated.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis is where we set in motion the most extraordinary experiment of self-government the world has ever known with three simple words: “We, the People.” “We, the People.”\\r\\n \\r\\nThese two documents and the ideas they embody—equality and democracy—are the rock upon which this nation is built. They are how we became the greatest nation on Earth. They are why, for more than two centuries, America has been a beacon to the world.\\r\\n \\r\\nBut as I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault. We do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise.\\r\\n \\r\\nSo tonight, I have come this place where it all began to speak as plainly as I can to the nation about the threats we face, about the power we have in our own hands to meet these threats, and about the incredible future that lies in front of us if only we choose it.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe must never forget: We, the people, are the true heirs of the American experiment that began more than two centuries ago.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe, the people, have burning inside each of us the flame of liberty that was lit here at Independence Hall—a flame that lit our way through abolition, the Civil War, Suffrage, the Great Depression, world wars, Civil Rights.\\r\\n \\r\\nThat sacred flame still burns now in our time as we build an America that is more prosperous, free, and just.\\r\\n \\r\\nThat is the work of my presidency, a mission I believe in with my whole soul.\\r\\n \\r\\nBut first, we must be honest with each other and with ourselves. \\r\\n \\r\\nToo much of what’s happening in our country today is not normal.\\r\\n \\r\\nDonald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.\\r\\n \\r\\nNow, I want to be very clear—very clear up front: Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology.\\r\\n \\r\\nI know because I’ve been able to work with these mainstream Republicans.\\r\\n \\r\\nBut there is no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country.\\r\\n \\r\\nThese are hard things. \\r\\n \\r\\nBut I’m an American President—not the President of red America or blue America, but of all America.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd I believe it is my duty—my duty to level with you, to tell the truth no matter how difficult, no matter how painful.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd here, in my view, is what is true: MAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution. They do not believe in the rule of law. They do not recognize the will of the people. \\r\\n \\r\\nThey refuse to accept the results of a free election. And they’re working right now, as I speak, in state after state to give power to decide elections in America to partisans and cronies, empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself.\\r\\n \\r\\nMAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards—backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey promote authoritarian leaders, and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey look at the mob that stormed the United States Capitol on January 6th—brutally attacking law enforcement—not as insurrectionists who placed a dagger to the throat of our democracy, but they look at them as patriots.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd they see their MAGA failure to stop a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election as preparation for the 2022 and 2024 elections.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey tried everything last time to nullify the votes of 81 million people. This time, they’re determined to succeed in thwarting the will of the people.\\r\\n \\r\\nThat’s why respected conservatives, like Federal Circuit Court Judge Michael Luttig, has called Trump and the extreme MAGA Republicans, quote, a “clear and present danger” to our democracy.\\r\\n \\r\\nBut while the threat to American democracy is real, I want to say as clearly as we can: We are not powerless in the face of these threats. We are not bystanders in this ongoing attack on democracy.\\r\\n \\r\\nThere are far more Americans—far more Americans from every—from every background and belief who reject the extreme MAGA ideology than those that accept it. \\r\\n \\r\\nAnd, folks, it is within our power, it’s in our hands—yours and mine—to stop the assault on American democracy.\\r\\n \\r\\nI believe America is at an inflection point—one of those moments that determine the shape of everything that’s to come after.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd now America must choose: to move forward or to move backwards? To build the future or obsess about the past? To be a nation of hope and unity and optimism, or a nation of fear, division, and of darkness?\\r\\n \\r\\nMAGA Republicans have made their choice. They embrace anger. They thrive on chaos. They live not in the light of truth but in the shadow of lies.\\r\\n \\r\\nBut together—together, we can choose a different path. We can choose a better path. Forward, to the future. A future of possibility. A future to build and dream and hope.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd we’re on that path, moving ahead.\\r\\n \\r\\nI know this nation. I know you, the American people. I know your courage. I know your hearts. And I know our history.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis is a nation that honors our Constitution. We do not reject it. \\r\\n \\r\\nThis is a nation that believes in the rule of law. We do not repudiate it. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a nation that respects free and fair elections. We honor the will of the people. We do not deny it. \\r\\n \\r\\nAnd this is a nation that rejects violence as a political tool. We do not encourage violence.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe are still an America that believes in honesty and decency and respect for others, patriotism, liberty, justice for all, hope, possibilities. \\r\\n \\r\\nWe are still, at our core, a democracy. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet history tells us that blind loyalty to a single leader and a willingness to engage in political violence is fatal to democracy.\\r\\n \\r\\nFor a long time, we’ve told ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed, but it’s not.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe have to defend it, protect it, stand up for it—each and every one of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why tonight I’m asking our nation to come together, unite behind the single purpose of defending our democracy regardless of your ideology. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re all called, by duty and conscience, to confront extremists who will put their own pursuit of power above all else. \\r\\n \\r\\nDemocrats, independents, mainstream Republicans: We must be stronger, more determined, and more committed to saving American democracy than MAGA Republicans are to—to destroying American democracy. \\r\\n \\r\\nWe, the people, will not let anyone or anything tear us apart. Today, there are dangers around us we cannot allow to prevail.  We hear—you’ve heard it—more and more talk about violence as an acceptable political tool in this country. It’s not. It can never be an acceptable tool. \\r\\n \\r\\nSo I want to say this plain and simple: There is no place for political violence in America. Period. None. Ever. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe saw law enforcement brutally attacked on January the 6th. We’ve seen election officials, poll workers—many of them volunteers of both parties—subjected to intimidation and death threats. And—can you believe it?—FBI agents just doing their job as directed, facing threats to their own lives from their own fellow citizens. \\r\\n \\r\\nOn top of that, there are public figures—today, yesterday, and the day before—predicting and all but calling for mass violence and rioting in the streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is inflammatory. It’s dangerous. It’s against the rule of law. And we, the people, must say: This is not who we are. \\r\\n \\r\\nLadies and gentlemen, we can’t be pro-insurrectionist and pro-American. They’re incompatible. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can’t allow violence to be normalized in this country. It’s wrong. We each have to reject political violence with all the moral clarity and conviction this nation can muster. Now.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe can’t let the integrity of our elections be undermined, for that is a path to chaos. \\r\\n \\r\\nLook, I know politics can be fierce and mean and nasty in America. I get it. I believe in the give-and-take of politics, in disagreement and debate and dissent.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe’re a big, complicated country. But democracy endures only if we, the people, respect the guardrails of the republic. Only if we, the people, accept the results of free and fair elections. Only if we, the people, see politics not as total war but mediation of our differences. \\r\\n \\r\\nDemocracy cannot survive when one side believes there are only two outcomes to an election: either they win or they were cheated. And that’s where MAGA Republicans are today. \\r\\n \\r\\nThey don’t understand what every patriotic American knows: You can’t love your country only when you win. It’s fundamental. \\r\\n \\r\\nAmerican democracy only works only if we choose to respect the rule of law and the institutions that were set up in this chamber behind me, only if we respect our legitimate political differences.  \\r\\n \\r\\nI will not stand by and watch—I will not—the will of the American people be overturned by wild conspiracy theories and baseless, evidence-free claims of fraud. \\r\\n \\r\\nI will not stand by and watch elections in this country stolen by people who simply refuse to accept that they lost. \\r\\n \\r\\nI will not stand by and watch the most fundamental freedom in this country—the freedom to vote and have your vote counted—and—be taken from you and the American people. \\r\\n \\r\\nLook, as your President, I will defend our democracy with every fiber of my being, and I’m asking every American to join me. \\r\\n \\r\\nThroughout our history, America has often made the greatest progress coming out of some of our darkest moments, like you’re hearing in that bullhorn. \\r\\n \\r\\nI believe we can and we must do that again, and we are. \\r\\n \\r\\nMAGA Republicans look at America and see carnage and darkness and despair. They spread fear and lies–-lies told for profit and power. \\r\\n \\r\\nBut I see a very different America—an America with an unlimited future, an America that is about to take off. I hope you see it as well.  Just look around.\\r\\n \\r\\nI believed we could lift America from the depths of COVID, so we passed the largest economic recovery package since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And today, America’s economy is faster, stronger than any other advanced nation in the world. We have more to go.\\r\\n \\r\\nI believed we could build a better America, so we passed the biggest infrastructure investment since President Dwight D. Eisenhower. And we’ve now embarked on a decade of rebuilding\\r\\nthe nation’s roads, bridges, highways, ports, water systems, high-speed Internet, railroads. \\r\\n \\r\\nI believed we could make America safer, so we passed the most significant gun safety law since President Clinton. \\r\\n \\r\\nI believed we could go from being the highest cost of prescriptions in the world to making prescription drugs and healthcare more affordable, so we passed the most significant healthcare reforms since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act. \\r\\n \\r\\nAnd I believed we could create—we could create a clean energy future and save the planet, so we passed the most important climate initiative ever, ever, ever. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe cynics and the critics tell us nothing can get done, but they are wrong. There is not a single thing America cannot do—not a single thing beyond our capacity if we do it together.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt’s never easy. But we’re proving that in America, no matter how long the road, progress does come. \\r\\n \\r\\nLook, I know the last year—few years have been tough. But today, COVID no longer controls our lives. More Americans are working than ever. Businesses are growing. Our schools are open. Millions of Americans have been lifted out of poverty. Millions of veterans once exposed to toxic burn pits will now get what they deserve for their families and the compensation. \\r\\n \\r\\nAmerican manufacturing has come alive across the Heartland, and the future will be made in America—no matter what the white supremacists and the extremists say. \\r\\n \\r\\nI made a bet on you, the American people, and that bet is paying off. Proving that from darkness —the darkness of Charlottesville, of COVID, of gun violence, of insurrection—we can see the light. Light is now visible. \\r\\n \\r\\nLight that will guide us forward not only in words, but in actions—actions for you, for your children, for your grandchildren, for America.\\r\\n \\r\\nEven in this moment, with all the challenges we face, I give you my word as a Biden: I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future. Not because of me, but because of who you are.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe’re going to end cancer as we know it. Mark my words. \\r\\n \\r\\nWe are going to create millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe’re going to think big. We’re going to make the 21st century another American century because the world needs us to. \\r\\n \\r\\nThat’s where we need to focus our energy—not in the past, not on divisive culture wars, not on the politics of grievance, but on a future we can build together.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe MAGA Republicans believe that for them to succeed, everyone else has to fail. They believe America—not like I believe about America. \\r\\n \\r\\nI believe America is big enough for all of us to succeed, and that is the nation we’re building: a nation where no one is left behind.\\r\\n \\r\\nI ran for President because I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. I still believe that to be true. I believe the soul is the breath, the life, and the essence of who we are. The soul is what makes us “us.”\\r\\n \\r\\nThe soul of America is defined by the sacred proposition that all are created equal in the image of God. That all are entitled to be treated with decency, dignity, and respect. That all deserve justice and a shot at lives of prosperity and consequence. And that democracy—democracy must be defended, for democracy makes all these things possible. Folks, and it’s up to us.\\r\\n \\r\\nDemocracy begins and will be preserved in we, the people’s, habits of heart, in our character: optimism that is tested yet endures, courage that digs deep when we need it, empathy that fuels democracy, the willingness to see each other not as enemies but as fellow Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, our democracy is imperfect. It always has been.\\r\\n \\r\\nNotwithstanding those folks you hear on the other side there. They’re entitled to be outrageous. This is a democracy. But history and common sense—good manners is nothing they’ve ever suffered from. \\r\\n \\r\\nBut history and common sense tell us that opportunity, liberty, and justice for all are most likely to come to pass in a democracy.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe have never fully realized the aspirations of our founding, but every generation has opened those doors a little wider to include more people who have been excluded before.\\r\\n \\r\\nMy fellow Americans, America is an idea—the most powerful idea in the history of the world. And it beats in the hearts of the people of this country. It beats in all of our hearts. It unites America. It is the American creed.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe idea that America guarantees that everyone be treated with dignity. It gives hate no safe harbor. It installs in everyone the belief that no matter where you start in life, there’s nothing you can’t achieve.\\r\\n \\r\\nThat’s who we are. That’s what we stand for. That’s what we believe. And that is precisely what we are doing: opening doors, creating new possibilities, focusing on the future. And we’re only just beginning. \\r\\n \\r\\nOur task is to make our nation free and fair, just and strong, noble and whole.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd this work is the work of democracy—the work of this generation. It is the work of our time, for all time.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe can’t afford to have—leave anyone on the sidelines. We need everyone to do their part. So speak up. Speak out. Get engaged. Vote, vote, vote. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if we all do our duty—if we do our duty in 2022 and beyond, then ages still to come will say we—all of us here—we kept the faith. We preserved democracy. We heeded not our worst instincts but our better angels. And we proved that, for all its imperfections, America is still the beacon to the world, an ideal to be realized, a promise to be kept.\\r\\n \\r\\nThere is nothing more important, nothing more sacred, nothing more American. That’s our soul. That’s who we truly are. And that’s who must—we must always be.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnd I have no doubt—none––that this is who we will be and that we’ll come together as a nation. That we’ll secure our democracy. That for the next 200 years, we’ll have what we had the past 200 years: the greatest nation on the face of the Earth. \\r\\n \\r\\nWe just need to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. The United States of America. \\r\\n \\r\\nAnd may God protect our nation. And may God protect all those who stand watch over our democracy. God bless you all. Democracy. Thank you. \\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"September 1, 2022: Remarks on the Continued Battle for the Soul of the Nation\"},{\"doc_name\":\"september-21-2022-speech-77th-session-united-nations-general\",\"date\":\"2022-09-21\",\"transcript\":\"Thank you. \\r\\n\\r\\nMr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, my fellow leaders, in the last year, our world has experienced great upheaval: a growing crisis in food insecurity; record heat, floods, and droughts; COVID-19; inflation; and a brutal, needless war—a war chosen by one man, to be very blunt. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet us speak plainly. A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its neighbor, attempted to erase a sovereign state from the map. \\r\\n\\r\\nRussia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations Charter—no more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbor by force. \\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow Russia is calling—calling up more soldiers to join the fight. And the Kremlin is organizing a sham referenda to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation of the U.N. Charter. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis world should see these outrageous acts for what they are. Putin claims he had to act because Russia was threatened. But no one threatened Russia, and no one other than Russia sought conflict. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, we warned it was coming. And with many of you, we worked to try to avert it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutin’s own words make his true purpose unmistakable. Just before he invaded, Putin asserted—and I quote—Ukraine was “created by Russia” and never had, quote, “real statehood.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now we see attacks on schools, railway stations, hospitals, wa-—on centers of Ukrainian history and culture. \\r\\nIn the past, even more horrifying evidence of Russia’s atrocity and war crimes: mass graves uncovered in Izyum; bodies, according to those that excavated those bodies, showing signs of torture. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis war is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine’s right to exist as a people. Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should not—that should make your blood run cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why 141 nations in the General Assembly came together to unequivocally condemn Russia’s war against Ukraine. The United States has marshaled massive levels of security assistance and humanitarian aid and direct economic support for Ukraine—more than $25 billion to date. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur allies and partners around the world have stepped up as well. And today, more than 40 countries represented in here have contributed billions of their own money and equipment to help Ukraine defend itself. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States is also working closely with our allies and partners to impose costs on Russia, to deter attacks against NATO territory, to hold Russia accountable for the atrocities and war crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause if nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for. Everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery victory won on the battlefield belongs to the courageous Ukrainian soldiers. But this past year, the world was tested as well, and we did not hesitate. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe chose liberty. We chose sovereignty. We chose principles to which every party to the United Nations Charter is beholding. We stood with Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike you, the United States wants this war to end on just terms, on terms we all signed up for: that you cannot seize a nation’s territory by force. The only country standing in the way of that is Russia. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, we—each of us in this body who is determined to uphold the principles and beliefs we pledge to defend as members of the United Nations—must be clear, firm, and unwavering in our resolve. \\r\\n\\r\\nUkraine has the same rights that belong to every sovereign nation. We will stand in solidarity with Ukraine. We will stand in solidarity against Russia’s aggression. Period.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, it’s no secret that in the contest between democracy and autocracy, the United States—and I, as President—champion a vision for our world that is grounded in the values of democracy. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States is determined to defend and strengthen democracy at home and around the world. Because I believe democracy remains humanity’s greatest instrument to address the challenges of our time. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re working with the G7 and likeminded countries to prove democracies can deliver for their citizens but also deliver for the rest of the world as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut as we meet today, the U.N. Charter—the U.N. Charter’s very basis of a stable and just rule-based order is under attack by those who wish to tear it down or distort it for their own political advantage. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the United Nations Charter was not only signed by democracies of the world, it was negotiated among citizens of dozens of nations with vastly different histories and ideologies, united in their commitment to work for peace. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs President Truman said in 1945, the U.N. Charter—and I quote—is “proof that nations, like men, can state their differences, can face them, and then can find common ground on which to stand.” End of quote.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat common ground was so straightforward, so basic that, today, 193 of you—193 member states—have willingly embraced its principles. And standing up for those principles for the U.N. Charter is the job of every responsible member state. \\r\\n\\r\\nI reject the use of violence and war to conquer nations or expand borders through bloodshed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo stand against global politics of fear and coercion; to defend the sovereign rights of smaller nations as equal to those of larger ones; to embrace basic principles like freedom of navigation, respect for international law, and arms control—no matter what else we may disagree on, that is the common ground upon which we must stand. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you’re still committed to a strong foundation for the good of every nation around the world, then the United States wants to work with you. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also believe the time has come for this institution to become more inclusive so that it can better respond to the needs of today’s world.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of the U.N. Security Council, including the United States, should consistently uphold and defend the U.N. Charter and refrain—refrain from the use of the veto, except in rare, extraordinary situations, to ensure that the Council remains credible and effective.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is also why the United States supports increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent representatives of the Council. This includes permanent seats for those nations we’ve long supported and permanent seats for countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States is committed to this vital work. In every region, we pursued new, constructive ways to work with partners to advance shared interests, from elevating the Quad in the Indo-Pacific; to signing the Los Angeles Declaration of Migration and Protection at the Summit of the Americas; to joining a historic meeting of nine Arab leaders to work toward a more peaceful, integrated Middle East; to hosting the U.S.-Africa Leaders’ Summit in—this December.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I said last year, the United States is opening an era of relentless diplomacy to address the challenges that matter most to people’s lives—all people’s lives: tackling the climate crisis, as the previous speaker spoke to; strengthening global health security; feeding the world—feeding the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe made that priority. And one year later, we’re keeping that promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the day I came to office, we’ve led with a bold climate agenda. We rejoined the Paris Agreement, convened major climate summits, helped deliver critical agreements on COP26. And we helped get two thirds of the world GDP on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now I’ve signed a historic piece of legislation here in the United States that includes the biggest, most important climate commitment we have ever made in the history of our country: $369 billion toward climate change. That includes tens of billions in new investments in offshore wind and solar, doubling down on zero emission vehicles, increasing energy efficiency, supporting clean manufacturing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Department of Energy estimates that this new law will reduce U.S. emissions by one gigaton a year by 2030 while unleashing a new era of clean-energy-powered economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur investments will also help reduce the cost of developing clean energy technologies worldwide, not just the United States. This is a global gamechanger—and none too soon. We don’t have much time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all know we’re already living in a climate crisis. No one seems to doubt it after this past year. As we meet, much of Pakistan is still underwater; it needs help. Meanwhile, the Horn of Africa faces unprecedented drought. \\r\\n\\r\\nFamilies are facing impossible choices, choosing which child to feed and wondering whether they’ll survive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the human cost of climate change. And it’s growing, not lessening.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, as I announced last year, to meet our global responsibility, my administration is working with our Congress to deliver more than $11 billion a year to international climate finance to help lower-income countries implement their climate goals and ensure a just energy transition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key part of that will be our PREPARE plan, which will help half a billion people, and especially vulnerable countries, adapt to the impacts of climate change and build resilience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis need is enormous. So let this be the moment we find within ourselves the will to turn back the tide of climate devastation and unlock a resilient, sustainable, clean energy economy to preserve our planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn global health, we’ve delivered more than 620 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to 116 countries around the world, with more available to help meet countries’ needs—all free of charge, no strings attached.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’re working closely with the G20 and other countries. And the United States helped lead the change to establish a groundbreaking new Fund for Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response at the World Bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, we’ve continued to advance the ball on enduring global health challenges.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater today, I’ll host the Seventh Replenishment Conference for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. With bipartisan support in our Congress, I have pledged to contribute up to $6 billion to that effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I look forward to welcoming a historic round of pledges at the conference resulting in one of the largest global health fundraisers ever held in all of history.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re also taking on the food crisis head on. With as many as 193 million people around the world experiencing acute—acute food insecurity—a jump of 40 million in a year—today I’m announcing another $2.9 billion in U.S. support for lifesaving humanitarian and food security assistance for this year alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia, in the meantime, is pumping out lies, trying to pin the blame for the crisis—the food crisis—onto sanctions imposed by many in the world for the aggression against Ukraine. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo let me be perfectly clear about something: Our sanctions explicitly allow—explicitly allow Russia the ability to export food and fertilizer. No limitation. It’s Russia’s war that is worsening food insecurity, and only Russia can end it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m grateful for the work here at the U.N.—including your leadership, Mr. Secretary-General—establishing a mechanism to export grain from Black Sea ports in Ukraine that Russia had blocked for months, and we need to make sure it’s extended.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe believe strongly in the need to feed the world. That’s why the United States is the world’s largest supporter of the World Food Programme, with more than 40 percent of its budget.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re leading support—we’re leading support of the UNICEF efforts to feed children around the world. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to take on the larger challenge of food insecurity, the United States introduced a Call to Action: a roadmap eliminating global food insecurity—to eliminating global food insecurity that more than 100 nation member states have already supported.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June, the G7 announced more than $4.5 billion to strengthen food security around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough USAID’s Feed the Future initiative, the United States is scaling up innovative ways to get drought- and heat-resistant seeds into the hands of farmers who need them, while distributing fertilizer and improving fertilizer efficiency so that farmers can grow more while using less.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we’re calling on all countries to refrain from banning food exports or hoarding grain while so many people are suffering. Because in every country in the world, no matter what else divides us, if parents cannot feed their children, nothing—nothing else matters if parents cannot feed their children.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we look to the future, we’re working with our partners to update and create rules of the road for new challenges we face in the 21st century.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe launched the Trade and Technology Council with the European Union to ensure that key technologies—key technologies are developed and governed in the way that benefits everyone. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith our partner countries and through the U.N., we’re supporting and strengthening the norms of responsibility—responsible state behavior in cyberspace and working to hold accountable those who use cyberattacks to threaten international peace and security. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith partners in the Americas, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific, we’re working to build a new economic ecosystem while—where every nation—every nation gets a fair shot and economic growth is resilient, sustainable, and shared. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why the United States has championed a global minimum tax. And we will work to see it implemented so major corporations pay their fair share everywhere—everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s also been the idea behind the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which the United States launched this year with 13 other Indo-Pacific economies. We’re working with our partners in ASEAN and the Pacific Islands to support a vision for a critical Indo-Pacific region that is free and open, connected and prosperous, secure and resilient.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether with partners around the world, we’re working to secure resilient supply chains that protect everyone from coercion or domination and ensure that no country can use energy as a weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as Russia’s war rolls the global economy, we’re also calling on major global creditors, including the non-Paris Club countries, to transparently negotiate debt forgiveness for lower-income countries to forestall broader economic and political crises around the world. \\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of infrastructure projects that generate huge and large debt without delivering on the promised advantages, let’s meet the enormous infrastructure needs around the world with transparent investments—high-standard projects that protect the rights of workers and the environment—keyed to the needs of the communities they serve, not to the contributor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why the United States, together with fellow G7 partners, launched a Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. We intend to collectively mobilize $600 billion in investment through this partnership by 2027. \\r\\n\\r\\nDozens of projects are already underway: industrial-scale vaccine manufacturing in Senegal, transformative solar projects in Angola, first-of-its-kind small modular nuclear power plant in Romania.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are investments that are going to deliver returns not just for those countries, but for everyone. The United States will work with every nation, including our competitors, to solve global problems like climate change. Climate diplomacy is not a favor to the United States or any other nation, and walking away hurts the entire world.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me be direct about the competition between the United States and China. As we manage shifting geopolitical trends, the United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader. We do not seek conflict. We do not seek a Cold War. We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut the United States will be unabashed in promoting our vision of a free, open, secure, and prosperous world and what we have to offer communities of nations: investments that are designed not to foster dependency, but to alleviate burdens and help nations become self-sufficient; partnerships not to create political obligation, but because we know our own success—each of our success is increased when other nations succeed as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen individuals have the chance to live in dignity and develop their talents, everyone benefits. Critical to that is living up to the highest goals of this institution: increasing peace and security for everyone, everywhere. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States will not waver in our unrelenting determination to counter and thwart the continuing terrorist threats to our world. And we will lead with our diplomacy to strive for peaceful resolution of conflicts. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe seek to uphold peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe remain committed to our One China policy, which has helped prevent conflict for four decades. And we continue to oppose unilateral changes in the status quo by either side. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe support an African Union-led peace process to end the fight in Ethiopia and restore security for all its people. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Venezuela, where years of the political oppression have driven more than 6 million people from that country, we urge a Venezuelan-led dialogue and a return to free and fair elections.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe continue to stand with our neighbor in Haiti as it faces political-fueled gang violence and an enormous human crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we call on the world to do the same. We have more to do. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll continue to back the U.N.-mediated truce in Yemen, which has delivered precious months of peace to people that have suffered years of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we will continue to advocate for lasting negotiating peace between the Jewish and democratic state of Israel and the Palestinian people. The United States is committed to Israel’s security, full stop. And a negotiated two-state solution remains, in our view, the best way to ensure Israel’s security and prosperity for the future and give the Palestinians the state which—to which they are entitled—both sides to fully respect the equal rights of their citizens; both people enjoying equal measure of freedom and dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me also urge every nation to recommit to strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime through diplomacy. No matter what else is happening in the world, the United States is ready to pursue critical arms control measures. A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe five permanent members of the Security Council just reaffirmed that commitment in January. But today, we’re seeing disturbing trends. Russia shunned the Non-Proliferation ideals embraced by every other nation at the 10th NPT Review Conference. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again, today, as I said, they’re making irresponsible nuclear threats to use nuclear weapons. China is conducting an unprecedented, concerning nuclear buildup without any transparency. \\r\\n\\r\\nDespite our efforts to begin serious and sustained diplomacy, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea continues to blatantly violate U.N. sanctions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd while the United States is prepared for a mutual return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action if Iran steps up to its obligations, the United States is clear: We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\nI continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve this outcome. The nonproliferation regime is one of the greatest successes of this institution. We cannot let the world now slide backwards, nor can we turn a blind eye to the erosion of human rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps singular among this body’s achievements stands the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is the standard by which our forebears challenged us to measure ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey made clear in 1948: Human rights are the basis for all that we seek to achieve. And yet today, in 2022, fundamental freedoms are at risk in every part of our world, from the violations of—in Xinjiang detailed in recent reports by the Office of U.N.—U.S.—reports detailing by the U.S. [U.N.] High Commissioner, to the horrible abuses against pro-democracy activists and ethnic minorities by the military regime in Burma, to the increased repression of women and girls by the Taliban in Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd today, we stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here’s what I know: The future will be won by those countries that unleash the full potential of their populations, where women and girls can exercise equal rights, including basic reproductive rights, and contribute fully to building a stronger economies and more resilient societies; where religious and ethnic minorities can live their lives without harassment and contribute to the fabric of their communities; where the LGBTQ+ community individuals live and love freely without being targeted with violence; where citizens can question and criticize their leaders without fear of reprisal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States will always promote human rights and the values enshrined in the U.N. Charter in our own country and around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me end with this: This institution, guided by the U.N. Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is at its core an act of dauntless hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me say that again: It’s an act of dauntless hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nThink about the vision of those first delegates who undertook a seemingly impossible task while the world was still smoldering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThink about how divided the people of the world must have felt with the fresh grief of millions dead, the genocidal horrors of the Holocaust exposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had every right to believe only the worst of humanity. Instead, they reached for what was best in all of us, and they strove to build something better: enduring peace; comity among nations; equal rights for every member of the human family; cooperation for the advancement of all humankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow leaders, the challenges we face today are great indeed, but our capacity is greater. Our commitment must be greater still.\\r\\nSo let’s stand together to again declare the unmistakable resolve that nations of the world are united still, that we stand for the values of the U.N. Charter, that we still believe by working together we can bend the arc of history toward a freer and more just world for all our children, although none of us have fully achieved it.\\r\\nWe’re not passive witnesses to history; we are the authors of history.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can do this—we have to do it—for ourselves and for our future, for humankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for your tolerance, for listening to me. I appreciate it very much. God bless you all. \\r\\n\",\"president\":\"Joe Biden\",\"title\":\"September 21, 2022: Speech before the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly\"},{\"doc_name\":\"september-9-2021-remarks-fighting-covid-19-pandemic\",\"date\":\"2021-09-09\",\"transcript\":\"THE PRESIDENT: Good evening, my fellow Americans. I want to talk to you about where we are in the battle against COVID-19, the progress we’ve made, and the work we have left to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it starts with understanding this: Even as the Delta variant 19 [sic] has—COVID-19—has been hitting this country hard, we have the tools to combat the virus, if we can come together as a country and use those tools.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we raise our vaccination rate, protect ourselves and others with masking and expanded testing, and identify people who are infected, we can and we will turn the tide on COVID-19.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will take a lot of hard work, and it’s going to take some time. Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated, even though the vaccine is safe, effective, and free.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou might be confused about what is true and what is false about COVID-19. So before I outline the new steps to fight COVID-19 that I’m going to be announcing tonight, let me give you some clear information about where we stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, we have cons—we have made considerable progress\\r\\n\\r\\nin battling COVID-19. When I became President, about 2 million Americans were fully vaccinated. Today, over 175 million Americans have that protection. \\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I took office, we hadn’t ordered enough vaccine for every American. Just weeks in office, we did. The week before I took office, on January 20th of this year, over 25,000 Americans died that week from COVID-19. Last week, that grim weekly toll was down 70 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in the three months before I took office, our economy was faltering, creating just 50,000 jobs a month. We’re now averaging 700,000 new jobs a month in the past three months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis progress is real. But while America is in much better shape than it was seven months ago when I took office, I need to tell you a second fact.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re in a tough stretch, and it could last for a while. The highly contagious Delta variant that I began to warn America about back in July spread in late summer like it did in other countries before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the vaccines provide strong protections for the vaccinated, we read about, we hear about, and we see the stories of hospitalized people, people on their death beds, among the unvaccinated over these past few weeks. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And it’s caused by the fact that despite America having an unprecedented and successful vaccination program, despite the fact that for almost five months free vaccines have been available in 80,000 different locations, we still have nearly 80 million Americans who have failed to get the shot. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to make matters worse, there are elected officials actively working to undermine the fight against COVID-19. Instead of encouraging people to get vaccinated and mask up, they’re ordering mobile morgues for the unvaccinated dying from COVID in their communities. This is totally unacceptable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, if you wonder how all this adds up, here’s the math: The vast majority of Americans are doing the right thing. Nearly three quarters of the eligible have gotten at least one shot, but one quarter has not gotten any. That’s nearly 80 million Americans not vaccinated. And in a country as large as ours, that’s 25 percent minority. That 25 percent can cause a lot of damage—and they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals, are overrunning the emergency rooms and intensive care units, leaving no room for someone with a heart attack, or pancreitis [pancreatitis], or cancer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd fourth, I want to emphasize that the vaccines provide very strong protection from severe illness from COVID-19. I know there’s a lot of confusion and misinformation. But the world’s leading scientists confirm that if you are fully vaccinated, your risk of severe illness from COVID-19 is very low. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, based on available data from the summer, only one of out of every 160,000 fully vaccinated Americans was hospitalized for COVID per day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the facts. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo here’s where we stand: The path ahead, even with the Delta variant, is not nearly as bad as last winter. But what makes it incredibly more frustrating is that we have the tools to combat COVID-19, and a distinct minority of Americans –supported by a distinct minority of elected officials—are keeping us from turning the corner. These pandemic politics, as I refer to, are making people sick, causing unvaccinated people to die. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot allow these actions to stand in the way of protecting the large majority of Americans who have done their part and want to get back to life as normal. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs your President, I’m announcing tonight a new plan to require more Americans to be vaccinated, to combat those blocking public health. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy plan also increases testing, protects our economy, and will make our kids safer in schools. It consists of six broad areas of action and many specific measures in each that—and each of those actions that you can read more about at WhiteHouse.gov. WhiteHouse.gov.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe measures—these are going to take time to have full impact. But if we implement them, I believe and the scientists indicate, that in the months ahead we can reduce the number of unvaccinated Americans, decrease hospitalizations and deaths, and allow our children to go to school safely and keep our economy strong by keeping businesses open.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, we must increase vaccinations among the unvaccinated with new vaccination requirements. Of the nearly 80 million eligible Americans who have not gotten vaccinated, many said they were waiting for approval from the Food and Drug Administration—the FDA. Well, last month, the FDA granted that approval.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, the time for waiting is over. This summer, we made progress through the combination of vaccine requirements and incentives, as well as the FDA approval. Four million more people got their first shot in August than they did in July. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut we need to do more. This is not about freedom or personal choice. It’s about protecting yourself and those around you—the people you work with, the people you care about, the people you love.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy job as President is to protect all Americans. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, tonight, I’m announcing that the Department of Labor is developing an emergency rule to require all employers with 100 or more employees, that together employ over 80 million workers, to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a week.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the biggest companies are already requiring this: United Airlines, Disney, Tysons Food, and even Fox News.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bottom line: We’re going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated co-workers. We’re going to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by increasing the share of the workforce that is vaccinated in businesses all across America.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy plan will extend the vaccination requirements that I previously issued in the healthcare field. Already, I’ve announced, we’ll be requiring vaccinations that all nursing home workers who treat patients on Medicare and Medicaid, because I have that federal authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I’m using that same authority to expand that to cover those who work in hospitals, home healthcare facilities, or other medical facilities–a total of 17 million healthcare workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you’re seeking care at a health facility, you should be able to know that the people treating you are vaccinated. Simple. Straightforward. Period.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, I will sign an executive order that will now require all executive branch federal employees to be vaccinated—all. And I’ve signed another executive order that will require federal contractors to do the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to work with the federal government and do business with us, get vaccinated. If you want to do business with the federal government, vaccinate your workforce. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd tonight, I’m removing one of the last remaining obstacles that make it difficult for you to get vaccinated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department of Labor will require employers with 100 or more workers to give those workers paid time off to get vaccinated. No one should lose pay in order to get vaccinated or take a loved one to get vaccinated.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, in total, the vaccine requirements in my plan will affect about 100 million Americans—two thirds of all workers. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for other sectors, I issue this appeal: To those of you running large entertainment venues—from sports arenas to concert venues to movie theaters—please require folks to get vaccinated or show a negative test as a condition of entry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to the nation’s family physicians, pediatricians, GPs—general practitioners—you’re the most trusted medical voice to your patients. You may be the one person who can get someone to change their mind about being vaccinated. \\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I’m asking each of you to reach out to your unvaccinated patients over the next two weeks and make a personal appeal to them to get the shot. America needs your personal involvement in this critical effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd my message to unvaccinated Americans is this: What more is there to wait for? What more do you need to see? We’ve made vaccinations free, safe, and convenient.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vaccine has FDA approval. Over 200 million Americans have gotten at least one shot. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin. And your refusal has cost all of us. So, please, do the right thing. But just don’t take it from me; listen to the voices of unvaccinated Americans who are lying in hospital beds, taking their final breaths, saying, “If only I had gotten vaccinated.” “If only.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a tragedy. Please don’t let it become yours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second piece of my plan is continuing to protect the vaccinated.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the vast majority of you who have gotten vaccinated, I understand your anger at those who haven’t gotten vaccinated. I understand the anxiety about getting a “breakthrough” case.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as the science makes clear, if you’re fully vaccinated, you’re highly protected from severe illness, even if you get COVID-19. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, recent data indicates there is only one confirmed positive case per 5,000 fully vaccinated Americans per day.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou’re as safe as possible, and we’re doing everything we can to keep it that way—keep it that way, keep you safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s where boosters come in—the shots that give you even more protection than after your second shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I know there’s been some confusion about boosters. So, let me be clear: Last month, our top government doctors announced an initial plan for booster shots for vaccinated Americans. They believe that a booster is likely to provide the highest level of protection yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, the decision of which booster shots to give, when to start them, and who will give them, will be left completely to the scientists at the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while we wait, we’ve done our part. We’ve bought enough boosters—enough booster shots—and the distribution system is ready to administer them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they are authorized, those eligible will be able to get a booster right away in tens of thousands of site across the—sites across the country for most Americans, at your nearby drug store, and for free. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe third piece of my plan is keeping—and maybe the most important—is keeping our children safe and our schools open. For any parent, it doesn’t matter how low the risk of any illness or accident is when it comes to your child or grandchild. Trust me, I know. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, let me speak to you directly. Let me speak to you directly to help ease some of your worries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt comes down to two separate categories: children ages 12 and older who are eligible for a vaccine now, and children ages 11 and under who are not are yet eligible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe safest thing for your child 12 and older is to get them vaccinated. They get vaccinated for a lot of things. That’s it. Get them vaccinated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with adults, almost all the serious COVID-19 cases we’re seeing among adolescents are in unvaccinated 12- to 17-year-olds—an age group that lags behind in vaccination rates.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, parents, please get your teenager vaccinated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about children under the age of 12 who can’t get vaccinated yet? Well, the best way for a parent to protect their child under the age of 12 starts at home. Every parent, every teen sibling, every caregiver around them should be vaccinated. \\r\\n\\r\\nChildren have four times higher chance of getting hospitalized if they live in a state with low vaccination rates rather than the states with high vaccination rates. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, if you’re a parent of a young child, you’re wondering when will it be—when will it be—the vaccine available for them. I strongly support an independent scientific review for vaccine uses for children under 12. We can’t take shortcuts with that scientific work. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut I’ve made it clear I will do everything within my power to support the FDA with any resource it needs to continue to do this as safely and as quickly as possible, and our nation’s top doctors are committed to keeping the public at large updated on the process so parents can plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow to the schools. We know that if schools follow the science and implement the safety measures—like testing, masking, adequate ventilation systems that we provided the money for, social distancing, and vaccinations—then children can be safe from COVID-19 in schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, about 90 percent of school staff and teachers are vaccinated. We should get that to 100 percent. My administration has already acquired teachers at the schools run by the Defense Department—because I have the authority as President in the federal system—the Defense Department and the Interior Department—to get vaccinated. That’s authority I possess. \\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I’m announcing that we’ll require all of nearly 300,000 educators in the federal paid program, Head Start program, must be vaccinated as well to protect your youngest—our youngest—most precious Americans and give parents the comfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd tonight, I’m calling on all governors to require vaccination for all teachers and staff. Some already have done so, but we need more to step up. \\r\\n\\r\\nVaccination requirements in schools are nothing new. They work. They’re overwhelmingly supported by educators and their unions. And to all school officials trying to do the right thing by our children: I’ll always be on your side. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet me be blunt. My plan also takes on elected officials and states that are undermining you and these lifesaving actions. Right now, local school officials are trying to keep children safe in a pandemic while their governor picks a fight with them and even threatens their salaries or their jobs. Talk about bullying in schools. If they’ll not help—if these governors won’t help us beat the pandemic, I’ll use my power as President to get them out of the way. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department of Education has already begun to take legal action against states undermining protection that local school officials have ordered. Any teacher or school official whose pay is withheld for doing the right thing, we will have that pay restored by the federal government 100 percent. I promise you I will have your back. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth piece of my plan is increasing testing and masking. From the start, America has failed to do enough COVID-19 testing. In order to better detect and control the Delta variant, I’m taking steps tonight to make testing more available, more affordable, and more convenient. I’ll use the Defense Production Act to increase production of rapid tests, including those that you can use at home. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile that production is ramping up, my administration has worked with top retailers, like Walmart, Amazon, and Kroger’s, and tonight we’re announcing that, no later than next week, each of these outlets will start to sell at-home rapid test kits at cost for the next three months. This is an immediate price reduction for at-home test kits for up to 35 percent reduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll also expand—expand free testing at 10,000 pharmacies around the country. And we’ll commit—we’re committing $2 billion to purchase nearly 300 million rapid tests for distribution to community health centers, food banks, schools, so that every American, no matter their income, can access free and convenient tests. This is important to everyone, particularly for a parent or a child—with a child not old enough to be vaccinated. You’ll be able to test them at home and test those around them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to testing, we know masking helps stop the spread of COVID-19. That’s why when I came into office, I required masks for all federal buildings and on federal lands, on airlines, and other modes of transportation. \\r\\n\\r\\nToday—tonight, I’m announcing that the Transportation Safety Administration—the TSA—will double the fines on travelers that refuse to mask. If you break the rules, be prepared to pay. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, by the way, show some respect. The anger you see on television toward flight attendants and others doing their job is wrong; it’s ugly. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth piece of my plan is protecting our economic recovery. Because of our vaccination program and the American Rescue Plan, which we passed early in my administration, we’ve had record job creation for a new administration, economic growth unmatched in 40 years. We cannot let unvaccinated do this progress—undo it, turn it back. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo tonight, I’m announcing additional steps to strengthen our economic recovery. We’ll be expanding COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan programs. That’s a program that’s going to allow small businesses to borrow up to $2 million from the current $500,000 to keep going if COVID-19 impacts on their sales. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese low-interest, long-term loans require no repayment for two years and be can used to hire and retain workers, purchase inventory, or even pay down higher cost debt racked up since the pandemic began. I’ll also be taking additional steps to help small businesses stay afloat during the pandemic. \\r\\n\\r\\nSixth, we’re going to continue to improve the care of those who do get COVID-19. In early July, I announced the deployment of surge response teams. These are teams comprised of experts from the Department of Health and Human Services, the CDC, the Defense Department, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency—FEMA—to areas in the country that need help to stem the spread of COVID-19. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince then, the federal government has deployed nearly 1,000 staff, including doctors, nurses, paramedics, into 18 states. Today, I’m announcing that the Defense Department will double the number of military health teams that they’ll deploy to help their fellow Americans in hospitals around the country. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, we’re increasing the availability of new medicines recommended by real doctors, not conspir-—conspiracy theorists. The monoclonal antibody treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by up to 70 percent for unvaccinated people at risk of developing sefe-—severe disease. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve already distributed 1.4 million courses of these treatments to save lives and reduce the strain on hospitals. Tonight, I’m announcing we will increase the average pace of shipment across the country of free monoclonal antibody treatments by another 50 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I close, let me say this: Communities of color are disproportionately impacted by this virus. And as we continue to battle COVID-19, we will ensure that equity continues to be at the center of our response. We’ll ensure that everyone is reached. My first responsibility as President is to protect the American people and make sure we have enough vaccine for every American, including enough boosters for every American who’s approved to get one. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also know this virus transcends borders. That’s why, even as we execute this plan at home, we need to continue fighting the virus overseas, continue to be the arsenal of vaccines. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re proud to have donated nearly 140 million vaccines over 90 countries, more than all other countries combined, including Europe, China, and Russia combined. That’s American leadership on a global stage, and that’s just the beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve also now started to ship another 500 million COVID vaccines—Pfizer vaccines—purchased to donate to 100 lower-income countries in need of vaccines. And I’ll be announcing additional steps to help the rest of the world later this month.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I recently released the key parts of my pandemic preparedness plan so that America isn’t caught flat-footed when a new pandemic comes again—as it will—next month, I’m also going to release the plan in greater detail.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo let me close with this: We have so-—we’ve made so much progress during the past seven months of this pandemic. The recent increases in vaccinations in August already are having an impact in some states where case counts are dropping in recent days. Even so, we remain at a critical moment, a critical time. We have the tools. Now we just have to finish the job with truth, with science, with confidence, and together as one nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, we’re the United States of America.

            "        \"transcript\": \"Deputies, Ladies and Gentlemen of the German Reichstag! In the name of the Reich Government I have asked the Reichstag President to convene the Reichstag so that I may take a stand before this forum on the questions which today affect not only our Volk but the entire world.   The problems which you know so well are of such great significance that not only   political pacification, but the economic salvation of all are contingent upon finding a   satisfactory solution.   When I express the desire on behalf of the German Government that the handling of   these problems be totally removed from the sphere of passion, I do this not least of all in the   realization dominating us all, namely that the crisis of our time owes its deepest origin alone   to those passions which dimmed the insight and intelligence of the nations after the War.   For all of the problems causing today’s unrest lie anchored in the deficiencies of the   Peace Treaty, which was unable to provide a judicious, clear and reasonable solution for the   most important and most decisive questions of the time for all ages to come. Neither the national problems nor the economic - not to mention the legal-problems and demands of the   peoples were solved by virtue of this Treaty in a manner which would allow them to   withstand the criticism of reason for all time. Thus it is understandable that the idea of a   revision is not only an integral part of the lasting side effects of the consequences of this   Treaty; indeed, the necessity of revision was foreseen by its authors and hence given a legal   foundation in the Treaty itself.   When I deal briefly here with the problems this Treaty should have solved, I am doing   so because the failure in these areas inevitably led to the subsequent situations under which   the political and economic relations between nations have been suffering since then.   The political problems are as follows: in the course of many centuries, the European   nations and their borders evolved from concepts which were based exclusively upon the idea   of a political State as such. With the triumphant assertion of the national idea and the principle   of nationalities in the course of the past century, the seeds of numerous conflicts were sown as   a result of the failure of States which had arisen under different circumstances to take these   new ideas and ideals into account. At the end of the Great War, there could have been no   greater task for a real peace conference than to undertake, in the clear recognition of this fact,   a territorial and political reorganization of the European States which would do justice to this   principle to the greatest possible degree.   The more closely the borders between peoples coincided with the borders between   States, the more this would have done away with a whole series of future potential conflicts.   In fact, this territorial reorganization of Europe, taking into account the actual borders   between peoples, would have constituted the solution in history which, with a view to the   future, might have allowed both victors and vanquished to perceive that the blood sacrifices of   the Great War were perhaps not completely in vain, for they might have served the world as   the foundations for a real peace.   As it was, solutions were chosen-partly due to ignorance, partly to passion and hatredwhich contained the perpetual seed of fresh conflicts in their very lack of logic and fairness.   The economic problems the conference was to have solved are as follows: The present   economic situation in Europe is characterized by the overpopulation of the European West   and, in the land comprising this territory, by the dearth of certain raw materials which are   indispensable for the customary standard of living in these very areas with their ancient   culture. Had one wished to bring about a certain pacification of Europe for the humanly   foreseeable future, it would have been necessary-instead of relying upon the unproductive and   dangerous concepts of penance, punishment, reparation, etc.-to rely upon and take into   account the deep realization that lack of means of existence has always been a source of   conflict between peoples. Instead of preaching the precepts of destruction, one would have   had to initiate a reorganization of the international, political and economic relations which   would have done justice to the vital needs of each individual people to the fullest possible   extent.   It is unwise to deprive a people of the economic resources necessary for its existence   without taking the fact into consideration that the population dependent upon them must of   necessity continue to live in this territory. It is absurd to believe that one is performing a   useful service to other peoples by economically destroying a people numbering 65 million.   Peoples who would proceed in such a manner would very soon, under the laws of nature   linking cause and effect, come to experience that they would be subjected to the same   catastrophe which they intended to impose upon another people. One day the concept of   reparations and their enforcement will become a classic example in the history of nations of   the extent to which disregard for international welfare can be damaging to all.   As it was, reparation politics could be financed only by German exports.   The export industry of the creditor states was made to suffer to the same extent to which   Germany, because of the reparations, was regarded as a sort of international export company.   Hence the economic advantages of the reparation payments could bear no relation to the   damage caused to the individual economies by these reparations.   The attempt to avoid this development by compensating for the limits placed on   German exports by means of granting loans to make the payments possible lacked   circumspection and was ultimately wrong. For the conversion of political debts to private   obligations led to an interest requirement, the fulfillment of which unavoidably produced the   same results. However, the worst of the matter was that the development of domestic   economic life was artificially checked and destroyed. Competition in the world markets by a   constant undercutting of prices led to an overintensification of rationalizing measures in the   economy.   The millions of our unemployed constitute the final consequence of this development.   Were one inclined to limit the reparation obligations to deliveries of goods, this would result   in no less substantial damage to the domestic production of the peoples profiting from them.   This is because deliveries of goods in the magnitude in question are not conceivable without   acute danger to the continued existence of the peoples’ own production.   133   The Treaty of Versailles is to blame for having inaugurated a period in which the   mathematical genius of finance is bringing about the demise of economic reason.   Germany has fulfilled these obligations imposed upon it, in spite of their inherent lack   of reason and the foreseeable consequences, so faithfully as to be virtually suicidal.   The international economic crisis is the indisputable proof of the correctness of this   statement.   The plan of restoring a general international sense of justice was no less destroyed by   the Treaty.   In order to justify all of the measures of this edict, Germany had to be branded as the   guilty party. This is a procedure which is, however, just as simple as it is impossible. This   would mean that in future, the vanquished will always bear the blame for conflicts, for the   victor will always be in a position to simply establish this as a fact.   This procedure therefore assumed a terrible significance because, at the same time, it   served as a reason for transforming the relative strength existing at the end of this War to a   lasting legal status. The concepts of victor and vanquished were hence made to constitute the   foundations of a new international legal and social order.   The degradation of a great people to a second-rate, second-class nation was proclaimed   in the same breath with which a League of Nations was called into being.   This treatment of Germany could not lead to a pacification of the world. The   disarmament and defenselessness of the vanquished which was considered necessary-an   unheard of procedure in the history of the European nations-was even less suited to diminish   the general dangers and conflicts; rather, it led to a state of affairs consisting of those   perpetual threats, demands and sanctions which threaten to become, by virtue of the continual   unrest and insecurity they cause, the death of the entire economy. If, in the lives of peoples,   every consideration of the risks involved in certain actions is omitted, unreason will all too   easily triumph over reason. At any rate, until now the League of Nations has been incapable   of providing appreciable assistance to the weak and unarmed on such occasions. Treaties   which are concluded for the pacification of the lives of peoples in relation to one another have   any real meaning only when they are based upon a genuine and honest equality of rights for   all. And this is the main reason for the turmoil which has dominated the world for years.   Finding a reasonable and lasting solution to the problems existing today lies in the   interests of all. No new European war would be capable of bringing about anything better in   place of the unsatisfactory conditions of the present.   On the contrary: the use of any type of violence in Europe could not serve to create a   more favorable political and economic situation than exists today.   Even if a fresh violent European solution were a decisive factor in solving the problems,   the final result would be an increase in the disturbance to the balance of power in Europe, and   therefore, one way or another, the seed of further conflicts and complications would be sown.   New wars, new uncertainty, and a new economic crisis would be the consequences. The   outbreak of such madness without end would, however, lead to the collapse of today’s social   and political order. A Europe sinking into Communist chaos would give rise to a crisis of   unforeseeable proportions and unpredictable length.   It is the earnest desire of the National Government of the German Reich to prevent such   an unpeaceful development by means of its honest and active cooperation.   This is also the real meaning behind the radical change which has taken place in   Germany. The three factors which dominate our revolution do not contradict the interests of   the rest of the world in any way.   First: preventing the impending Communist subversion and constructing a Volksstaat   uniting the various interests of the classes and ranks, and maintaining the concept of personal   property as the foundation of our culture. Second: solving the most pressing social problems   by leading the army of millions of our pitiful unemployed back to production. Third: restoring   a stable and authoritarian leadership of the State, supported by the confidence and will of the   nation which will finally again make of this great Volk a legitimate partner to the rest of the   world.   Speaking now, conscious of being a German National Socialist, I would like to proclaim   on behalf of the National Government and the entire national uprising that, above all, we in   this young Germany are filled with the deepest understanding of the same feelings and   convictions and the justified demands of the other nations to live. The generation of this   young Germany, which until now has come in its lifetime to know only the want, misery and   distress of its own Volk, has suffered too dearly from this madness to be capable of   contemplating subjecting others to more of the same.   In that we are devoted to our own identity as a Volk in boundless love and faith, we also   respect the national rights of other peoples on the basis of a common conviction and desire   from the very bottom of our hearts to live with them in peace and friendship.   Thus the concept of Germanization is alien to us. The mentality of the past century, on   the basis of which it was believed possible to make Germans of Poles and Frenchmen, is   foreign to us, just as we passionately reject any respective attempt in the opposite direction.   We view the European nations as a given fact. The French, the Poles, etc. are our neighbors,   and we know that no historically conceivable event can change this reality.   It would have been fortunate for the world had these realities been given due   consideration in respect to Germany in the Treaty of Versailles. For the object of a genuinely   lasting treaty should not be to cut open fresh wounds or keep existing ones open, but rather to   close and heal the wounds. A judicious handling of the problems could easily have arrived at   a solution in the East which would have accommodated both the understandable claims of   Poland as well as the natural rights of Germany. The Treaty of Versailles failed to provide this   solution. In spite of this, no German Government will of its own accord violate an agreement   which cannot be eliminated without being replaced by a better one.   Yet this recognition of the legal character of such a treaty can be merely a general one.   Not only the victor, but the vanquished as well has claim to the rights accorded it therein. But   the right to demand a revision of the Treaty lies anchored in the Treaty itself. The German   Government wishes to base the reasons for and the extent of its claims on nothing other than   the present results of past experiences and the incontestable consequences of critical and   logical reasoning. The experiences of the last fourteen years are both politically and   economically unequivocal.   The misery of the peoples was not alleviated; instead, it increased. The deepest root of   this misery lies, however, in the division of the world into victor and vanquished as the   intended permanent basis for all treaties and any future order. The worst effects of this order   are expressed in the forced defenselessness of one nation in the face of an exaggerated   armament on the part of the others.   The reasons why Germany has been staunchly demanding universal disarmament for   years are as follows: First of all, the demand for equality of rights expressed in actual facts is   a demand of morality, right and reason; a demand which was acknowledged in the Treaty   itself and the fulfillment of which was indissolubly tied to the demand for German   disarmament as a starting point for world disarmament.   Secondly, because conversely the degradation of a great Volk cannot be maintained in   history forever but must of necessity one day come to an end.   How long is it believed to be possible to impose such an injustice upon a great nation?   What is the advantage of the moment worth in comparison to the ongoing developments of   centuries? The German Volk will continue to exist, just as the French and, as we have learned   from historical evolution, the Polish have done. What significance and what value can the   successful short-term oppression of a people of 65 million have in comparison to the force of   these incontrovertible facts? No State can have a greater understanding of the newly   established young European national States than the Germany of the National Revolution   which has arisen from the same will. It wants nothing for itself which it is not prepared to   accord to others.   When Germany today lodges the demand for genuine equality of rights in respect to the   disarmament of the other nations, it has a moral right to do so given its own fulfillment of the   treaties. For Germany did disarm, and Germany performed this disarmament under the   strictest international control. Six million rifles and carbines were handed over or destroyed;   the German Volk was forced to destroy or surrender 130,000 machine guns, huge amounts of   machine gun barrels, 91,000 pieces of artillery, 38.75 million shells, and an enormous supply   of other weapons and munitions.   The Rhineland was demilitarized, the German fortresses were pulled down, our ships   surrendered, the aircraft destroyed, our military system was abandoned, and thus the training   of reserves prevented. Even the most needed weapons of defense were denied us.   If, in the face of these indisputable facts, anyone should come forward today, citing   truly pitiful excuses and pretexts and claiming that Germany did not comply with the Treaty   and had even rearmed, I must reject this view at this time for being as untrue as it is unfair.   It is equally incorrect to claim that Germany has not complied with the provisions of the   Treaty in respect to personnel. The allegation that the SA and the SS of the National Socialist   Party are connected in any way with the Reichswehr in the sense that they represent   formations with military training or army reserves is untrue! A single example serves to   illustrate the irresponsible thoughtlessness with which such allegations are made: last year in   Brünn, members of the National Socialist Party in Czechoslovakia were put to trial. Sworn   experts of the Czech Army claimed that the defendants maintained connections to the   National Socialist Party in Germany, were dependent upon it and thus, as members of a   popular sports club (Volkssportverein), were to be equated with members of the SA and SS in   Germany which constituted a reserve army trained and organized by the Reichswehr.   At the same time, however, the SA and SS-just as the National Socialist Party itself-not   only had no connection with the Reichswehr whatsoever: on the contrary, they were regarded   as organizations hostile to the State and persecuted, banned, and finally dissolved. And even   beyond that: members of the National Socialist Party and those belonging to the SA and SS   were not only excluded from all public offices-they were not even allowed to take on   employment as simple workers in an army company. Nonetheless, the National Socialists in   Czechoslovakia were given long prison sentences on the basis of this false view. In reality, the   SA and the SS of the National Socialist Party have evolved totally without aid, totally without   financial support from the State, the Reich, or even less the Reichswehr; without any sort of   military training and without any sort of military equipment, out of pure party political needs   and in accordance with party political considerations. Their purpose was and is exclusively   confined to the elimination of the Communist threat, and their training, which bears no   connection to the Army, was designed solely for the purposes of propaganda and   enlightenment, mass psychological effect, and the crushing of Communist terror.   They are institutions for instilling a true community spirit, overcoming former class   differences, and alleviating economic want.   The Stahlhelm came into being in memory of the great age of the common experiences   at the front, to nurture established traditions, maintain comrade- ship, and finally also to   protect the German Volk from the Communist revolution which has been threatening the Volk   since November 1918, a threat which admittedly cannot be fathomed by countries who have   never had millions of organized Communists as we have and have not suffered at the hands of   terror as Germany has. For the real objective of these national organizations is best   characterized by the type of struggle in which they are actually engaged, and the toll this has   taken. As a consequence of Communist slayings and acts of terror in the space of only a few   years, the SA and SS suffered over 350 dead and about 40,000 injured. If today the attempt is   being made in Geneva to add these organizations which exclusively serve domestic purposes   to the Armed Forces figure, then one might as well count the fire brigades, the gymnastics   clubs, the security corps, the rowing clubs, and other sports organizations as members of the   Armed Forces, too.   However, when at the same time the trained annual contingents of the other armies of   the world are not included, in contrast to these men totally lacking in military training; when   one deliberately overlooks the armed reserves of the others while commencing to count the   unarmed members of our political associations, we have before us a procedure against which I   must lodge the sharpest protest! If the world wishes to destroy confidence in what is right and   just, these are the best means of doing so.   On behalf of the German Volk and the German Government, I must make the following   clear: Germany has disarmed. It has fulfilled the obligations imposed upon it in the Peace   Treaty to an extent far beyond the limits of what can be deemed fair or even reasonable. Its   army consists of 100,000 men. The strength and character of its police is internationally   regulated.   The auxiliary police instituted in the days of the Revolution is exclusively political in   character. In those critical days, it replaced the other part of the police which, at the time, the   new regime suspected of being unstable. Now that the Revolution has been successfully   carried through, this force is already being depleted and will be completely dissolved even   before the year is over. Germany thus has a fully justified moral right to insist that the other   powers also fulfill their obligations pursuant to the Treaty of Versailles. The equality of rights   accorded to Germany in December has not yet become reality. Since France has repeatedly   asserted that the safety of France must be given the same consideration as Germany’s equality   of rights, I would like to pose two questions in this regard: 1. So far, Germany has accepted   all of the obligations in respect to security arising from the signing of the Treaty of Versailles,   the Kellogg Pact, the Treaties of Arbitration, the Pact of NonAggression, etc. What other   concrete assurances are there which Germany could assume? 2. On the other hand, what   security does Germany have? According to the information of the League of Nations, France   alone has 3,046 aircraft in service while Belgium has 350, Poland 700, and Czechoslovakia   670. In addition, there are innumerable quantities of reserve aircraft, thousands of armored   vehicles, thousands of pieces of heavy artillery, and all of the technical means required to   conduct warfare with chemical gases. Doesn’t Germany have more reason, in view of its lack   of defenses and weapons, to demand security than the armed states united by alliances?   Germany is nonetheless prepared at any time to assume further obligations to ensure   international security if all other nations are willing to do so as well and Germany also   benefits from this step. Germany would also be more than willing to disband its entire   military establishment and destroy those few weapons still remaining at its disposal, were the   bordering nations to do the same without exception. However, if the other States are not   willing to comply with the disarmament provisions imposed upon them by the Peace Treaty   of Versailles, then Germany must, at the very least, insist upon its demand for equal   treatment. The German Government sees in the British plan a possible basis for the answer to   these questions. However, it must demand that it not be forced to destroy an existing military   institution without being granted at least qualitatively equal rights. Germany must demand   that any commutation of the military institution in Germany-an institution we do not want in   Germany, but one which was forced upon us from abroad-is performed only to the extent of   the actual disarmament performed concurrently by the other States.   In this connection, Germany is essentially willing to agree to a transitional period of   five years to bring about its national security in the expectation that, subsequent thereto,   Germany will be accorded genuine equality with the other States. Germany is also perfectly   prepared to completely abandon offensive weapons if, within a certain period, the armed   nations destroy their own offensive weapons in turn and the use of such weapons is banned by   international convention. It is Germany’s sole desire to maintain its independence and be in a   position to protect its borders.   According to a statement made in February 1932 by the French Minister of War, a large   portion of the colored French troops are available for immediate use on the French mainland.   He therefore has explicitly included them in the home forces.   Thus it is only fair to take the colored forces into account as an integral part of the   French Army in the disarmament conference as well. Although one refuses to do this, one   nevertheless proposes counting associations and organizations as part of the German Army   which serve purely educational and sporting purposes and are given no military training   whatsoever. In the other countries, there is no question of these types of associations being   counted as part of military strength. This is obviously a completely impossible procedure.   Germany would also be willing at any time, in the event that an objective international   arms control board is created, to subject the associations in question to such control-given the   same willingness on the part of the other States-in order to demonstrate to the whole world its   wholly unmilitary character. Furthermore, the German Government will reject no ban on arms   as being too drastic if it is likewise applied to the other States.   These demands do not mean rearmament, but rather a desire for the disarmament of the   other States. On behalf of the German Government, I may once again welcome the farsighted   and just plan of the Italian Head of State to create, by means of a special pact, close relations   of confidence and cooperation between the four major European powers, Great Britain,   France, Italy, and Germany. Mussolini’s view that this would serve as a bridge to facilitate an   understanding is a view with which the German Government agrees out of its most deeply   seated convictions. It desires to oblige to the fullest possible extent if the other nations as well   are inclined to genuinely overcome any difficulties which may stand in the way.   Thus the proposal made by the American President Roosevelt, of which I learned last   night, deserves the warmest thanks of the German Government.   The Government is prepared to consent to this method for solving the international   crisis, for it is of the opinion that, if the question of disarmament is not solved, permanent   economic reconstruction is inconceivable. It is willing to make a selfless contribution to this   task of restoring the political and economic state of the world to order. It is also, as I have   stressed in the beginning, of the conviction that there can only be one great task in our time:   securing peace in the world.   I feel obliged to state that the reason for today’s armament in France or Poland can   under no circumstances be the fear of these nations of a German invasion. For such a fear   would only be justified by the existence of modern offensive weapons. But these modern   offensive weapons are exactly the ones which Germany does not have: it has neither heavy   artillery nor tanks nor bombers nor poisonous gases.   The only nation which has reason to fear an invasion is the German nation, which is not   only barred from having offensive weapons, but even restricted in its right to possess   defensive weapons and prohibited from erecting fortifications on its borders. Germany is   prepared to renounce offensive weapons at any time if the rest of the world does the same.   Germany is willing to join any solemn pact of non-aggression, for Germany’s concern is not   offensive warfare, but its own security.   Germany would welcome the opportunity suggested in President Roosevelt’s proposal   of incorporating the United States in European relations in the role of guarantor of peace. This   proposal signifies a great consolation to all those who wish to seriously cooperate toward   maintaining peace. Our one most fervent desire is to contribute toward permanently healing   the wounds inflicted by the War and the Treaty of Versailles. And Germany will take no path   other than that which is recognized by the treaties themselves as just. The German Goverment   wishes to engage in peaceful discussions with the other nations on all difficult questions. It   knows that, given any military action in Europe, even if it be completely successful, the losses   thus incurred would bear no relation to the gains.   Under no circumstances, however, will the German Government and the German Volk   allow themselves to be coerced into signing anything which would constitute a perpetuation   of Germany’s degradation. Any attempt to influence the Government and the Volk with   threats will be to no avail. It is conceivable that, contrary to everything which is right and   moral, Germany could be raped; it is, however, inconceivable and out of the question that   such an act could be accorded legitimacy by means of our own signature.   The attempt has been made in newspaper articles and regrettable speeches to threaten   Germany with sanctions, but a method as monstrous as this can only be the punishment for   the fact that, by demanding disarmament, we are asking that the treaties be fulfilled. Such a   measure could lead only to the ultimate moral and factual invalidation of the treaties   themselves. But even in that case, Germany would never give up its peaceful demands. The   political and economic consequences-the chaos which such an attempt would cause in   Europe-would be the responsibility of those who resorted to such measures to fight a people   which is doing no harm to the world.   Any such attempt, any attempt at doing violence to Germany by means of forming a   simple majority against the unequivocal spirit of the treaties could only be dictated by the   intention of excluding us from the conferences. But today the German Volk possesses enough   character to refrain, in such an event, from forcing its cooperation upon the other nations; it   would rather, albeit with a heavy heart, draw the only possible conclusions.   It would be difficult for us to remain a member of the League of Nations as a Volk   subjected to constant degradation. The German Government and the German Volk are aware   of the present crisis. For years, warnings have come from Germany to desist from the methods   which have inevitably produced this political and economic state of affairs. If the present   course is held and the present methods are continued, there can be no doubt as to the final   result.   Seeming political successes on the part of individual nations will be followed by all the   more severe economic and hence political catastrophes affecting all. We regard it as our first   and foremost task to prevent this.   No effective action has been undertaken to date. The rest of the world tells us that one did, in   fact, harbor a certain amount of sympathy for the former Germany; now at least we have   become acquainted with the consequences and effects of this “sympathy” in Germany and for   Germany! Millions of lives destroyed, entire trades ruined, and an enormous army of   unemployed-an inconsolable wretchedness, the extent and depth of which I would like to   convey to the rest of the world today in a single figure: Since the day when this Treaty was   signed, which was, as a work of peace, to be the foundation for a new and better age for all   peoples, there have been 224,000 people in our German Volk who, moved almost exclusively   by want and misery, have chosen to take their own lives-men and women, young and old   alike! These incorruptible witnesses are an indictment against the spirit and fulfillment of a   treaty, from the effects of which not only the rest of the world, but also millions of people in   Germany once expected salvation and good fortune. May this also serve to make the other   nations understand Germany's unshakable will and determination to finally put an end to a era   of human aberration in order to find the way to an ultimate consensus of all on the basis ofequal rights.\"\n",

Today-six years later-I am able to speak before this first   Greater German Reichstag! Truly, we are today better equipped than any   generation before us to appreciate the pious import of the saying: “What a turn of events   brought about by divine dispensation!” Six years sufficed to fulfill the dreams of many a   century; one year to afford our Volk enjoyment of the unity which many a generation yearned   for in vain.   When I look at you today, the representatives of our German Volk from all Gaus of the   Reich gathered around me, and I know the elected men of the Ostmark and the Sudetenland to   be among you, then I am once more overwhelmed by those tremendous impressions   recollected from that one year which realized the longings of centuries. How much blood was   shed for this object-for naught! How many millions of German men strode forth on this bitter   path throughout the years, conscious or unconscious of the higher ambitions they served-a   path which led them to a swift or painfully prolonged death. How many others were   condemned to end their lives behind fortress or dungeon walls, lives they sought only to   dedicate to Greater Germany! How many hundreds of thousands, bending under the yoke of   misery and worry, were forced to join that never-ending stream of German emigrants surging   forth into the world, for decades cherishing the memory of the unfortunate homeland, after   generations forgetting her. And now, in the span of this one year, a dream has come true.   It was not realized without a fight, as many an forgetful bourgeois might believe. For   before this year of German unity, a political idea had to struggle fanatically for nearly two   decades. Hundreds of thousands, millions risked their lives, their physical existence and   economic livelihood. They put up with mockery and scorn as willingly as they faced abusive   treatment, base defamation, and near-unbearable terror. Throughout the German Gaus,   countless corpses and the injured splattered with blood bore witness to this struggle. And,   moreover, this success was secured by an immeasurable rallying of willpower and   perseverance in valiant and zealous determination. I must say this today because there is a   danger that certain elements who contributed the least to the practical implementation of   German unity now seek, as brash orators, to appropriate to themselves the creation of this   Reich. They portray the events of 1938 as a most natural, long-overdue, foregone conclusion,   only belatedly realized by National Socialism.   To counter these elements, I must first state that perseverance through this year required   a strength of nerves of which these dwarfs have not an inkling.   They are well-known to us, these old incorrigible pessimists, skeptical and apathetic,   who throughout the twenty years of our struggle made a positive contribution by making   none. Now, after the victory, these self-proclaimed experts of the national uprising feel called   on to contribute their comments and criticism to it.   I will now in a few sentences offer you an objective recapitulation of the historic events   in this memorable year 1938.   Friday evening [March 11, 1938] a plea reached me, in the interest of preenting anarchy   and chaos in this country, to order German troops to march.   Already by 10:00 p.m., units were crossing the border at several locations. The general   invasion began at 6:00 in the morning [March 12, 1938], to the great and unforgettable   jubilation of the people now finally liberated.   The man responsible for these developments was the then State President Dr. Beneš,   who transformed Czechoslovakia into the exponent of the outside world’s hostile intentions   against the Reich. It was he who, on the prodding and with the active participation of certain   foreign circles,114 carried out the mobilization in May a year ago which sought first to provoke   the German Reich and, second, to do injury to the German Reich’s prestige abroad.   The fictitious report of a German mobilization allegedly forcing Czechoslovakia to   mobilize its armed forces was maintained and propagated, despite an official declaration twice   conveyed at my bidding to the Czech State President Beneš, stating that Germany had not   mobilized even a single soldier, and in spite of identical assertions to representatives of   foreign powers. Insistent demands called for Germany to countermand the fictitious   mobilization order and to renounce its pretenses. Beneš labored to spread the rumor that the   determined nature of the steps he had taken had forced the German Reich back within its   appropriate borders. Since the Reich had neither mobilized its forces nor entertained any   intentions of attacking Czechoslovakia, this situation would have entailed without a doubt a   serious loss of prestige for the Reich.   Because of this unbearable provocation, which was exacerbated by the truly infamous   persecution and terrorization of our Germans there, I have decided to resolve the Sudeten   German question in a radical manner and to resolve it once and for all.   On May 28, I issued orders: a) for the preparation of a military intervention against this   state on October 2, b) for the intensification and expansion of our fortified line of defense to   the West.   For the remainder of the confrontation with Herr Beneš and for the defense of the Reich   against any attempts to influence or threaten it, there was a plan for the immediate   mobilization of ninety-six divisions, to be reinforced if necessary by a great number of   additional units within a short time period.   The developments during the summer months and the situation of the Germans in   Czechoslovakia proved these precautions to have been appropriate.   When certain newspapers and politicians in the outside world insist that Germany is   threatening other peoples by military extortion, it is on the grounds of a grossly distorted   rendition of the facts. Germany has merely realized the right to self-determination of ten   million German Volksgenossen in this area in which neither the English nor other Western   nations have any business meddling. The Reich does not pose a threat to anyone, it has merely   defended itself against the attempts at intervention by third parties.   There is no need for me to assure you, my Deputies, Men of the German Reichstag, that,   in the future also, we will not stand for the Western states meddling in certain affairs, which   concern us exclusively, in order to preclude by their intervention the arrival at natural and   reasonable solutions.   Therefore, all of us were happy about the initiative of our friend Benito Mussolini and at   the also highly appreciated readiness of Chamberlain and Daladier which allowed us to find   elements for a peaceful settlement of a situation which demanded immediate attention.   Moreover, this can justly be regarded as evidence of the possibility of a reasoned treatment of   certain problems of vital interest and their resolution. However, without the determination to   resolve this problem in one way or another, such an agreement between the great European   powers could not have become a reality.   Hence, we have before us toda a form of representation of the German Volk which can   claim to be a truly constituent body.   The German Volk of earlier decades, politically and socially disorganized, squandered   large part of its inherent strength in an inner struggle as fruitless as it was senseless. The socalled democratic freedom to live to the full according to one’s persuasions and instincts leads   not to an evolutionary advancement nor to a freeing of exceptional forces or values. Instead, it   leads to a squandering of the existing wealth of the creative potential of the individual and to   his ultimate paralysis. By putting an end to this fruitless struggle, National Socialism released   the inner strength otherwise suppressed and set it free to realize the vital interests of the nation   in the sense of managing the great community tasks in the interior of the Reich and securing   the vital necessities for the community with regard to the surrounding world.   It is complete nonsense to presume that obedience and discipline are useful only to   soldiers and that they have no further application in the life of peoples beyond this. To the   contrary: a Volksgemeinschaft instilled with discipline and obedience can far more easily   mobilize the forces necessary to secure the survival of its own people, thereby benefiting   other peoples and serving the interests of all more effectively.   Such a Volksgemeinschaft cannot be created by force primarily, however, but by the   compelling force of the idea itself, hence, through the toil of a continuing education.   There are indeed men whom neither the greatest of calamities nor earthshattering   upheaval can incite to inner reflection or induce to spiritual action.   Their hearts beat no more. They are of no value to the community. They cannot make   history and history cannot be made with them. Their blase decadence and narrow-mindedness   expose them as a useless waste product of nature (Ausschussware der Natur). They find some   consolation, even satisfaction, in considering what they hold to be their cleverness or wisdom   elevating them to a lofty height above the events of the day; in other words, in the   contemplation of their own ignorance.   Now it is easy to imagine that, without such ignorant men, a Volk may well be capable   of the greatest actions and deeds. However, it is impossible to imagine a nation, much less to   lead it, which has at its core a multitude of such ignorant men instead of a mass of fullblooded, idealistic, believing, and positive men.   They constitute the only valuable elements in a Volksgemeinschaft. You will allow   them a thousand weaknesses, if only they possess the strength to give all they have, if   necessary, for an ideal or for an idea.   My Deputies, we still face enormous, gigantic tasks! We must build up a new class of   leaders for our Volk. Its composition is subject to racial criteria.   Through the educational system and the methods we employ, it is equally necessary to   demand and secure valor and readiness to take on responsibility as natural prerequisites to the   assumption of public office.   In assigning men to posts of leadership in State and Party, attitude and character are to   be valued more highly than so-called purely scientific or supposed mental qualifications. For,   wherever leadership has to be exercised, it is not abstract knowledge which is decisive, but   instead the inborn ability to lead and therefore a high degree of readiness to take on   responsibility, of determination, courage, and persistence.   In principle, we must realize that documented proof of a presumedly firstclass scientific   education can never compensate for a lack of readiness to take on responsibility. Knowledge   and leadership abilities, and hence vigor, are not mutually exclusive. In case of doubt,   however, knowledge cannot serve as a substitute for attitude, courage, valor, and initiative,   under any circumstances.   These attributes are the more important ones in terms of the leadership of a   Volksgemeinschaft in Party and State.   When I express this to you, my Deputies, I do so under the impression of that year of   German history which has taught me, more than my entire previous life, how important and   irreplaceable these virtues are and how, in a critical hour, one man of action weighs more than   one thousand sophisticated weaklings. As a social phenomenon this new selection of   leadership has to be divorced from the numerous prejudices, which I can only term phoney   and profoundly nonsensical social morals.   There is no attitude which does not have its ultimate justification in the resulting   advantages for the community. What is unimportant or detrimental to the existence of the   community can never be seen as moral in the service of a social order. Above all: a   Volksgemeinschaft is conceivable only in recognition of laws which apply to all. You cannot   expect or demand of one that he abide by principles which seem absurd, detrimental, or   merely unimportant in the eyes of another.   I fail to comprehend the endeavors of dying social classes, seeking to hide behind a   hedge of withering class laws which have become unreal and divorcing themselves from   reality to sustain life artificially. Nothing can be said against it, if it is being done in an effort   to secure a calm cemetery where to rest after passing away. However, if it is being done in   order to erect a barrier against the progress of life, then the storm of a forward charging youth   will brush away the old scrub.   Today’s German Volksstaat knows no social prejudices. Hence, it knows no special   social morals. It knows only the laws and necessities of life, as they reveal themselves to man   through reason and knowledge.   The unity of the entire German Volkskorper, whose foremost guarantors you are and   will continue to be, my Deputies, affords me the certainty that whatever tasks pose themselves   to our Volk, the National Socialist State will resolve them sooner or later! Whatever the   nature of the difficulties we encounter may be, the valor and the courage of its leadership will   master them!   1. We fight a truly gigantic struggle to which we have dedicated the entire force and   energy of our Volk, and   2. we will win this struggle without reservations; yes, indeed, we have already won it!   For what is the reason for all our economic troubles? Simply the overpopulation of our   Lebensraum! And in this context, I can only hold out to these critical gentlemen in the West   and in the democracies beyond Europe one simple fact and one simple question: The German   Volk survives with 135 inhabitants per square kilometer without any exterior assistance and   without access to its earlier savings. The rest of the world has looted Germany throughout the   past one-and-a-half decades, has burdened it with enormous debt payments. Without any   colonies, its people are nonetheless fed and clothed and, moreover, Germany boasts no   unemployment. And now to my question: Who among our so-called great democratic powers   is in a position to say as much of itself?! [-] To him on whom nature has bestowed bananas for   free,116 the struggle for survival necessarily will appear far easier than to the weary German   peasant who, all year round, toils to sow and reap on his plot of soil. And, therefore, we insist   that this carefree, internationalist banana picker refrain from finding fault with the labor of our   German peasant.   The dilemma we shall then face can only be resolved in two ways:   1. through an increase in the import of foodstuffs which necessitates an increase in the   export of German manufactured goods in due consideration of the fact that raw materials used   in the production process have to be imported initially and hence only a fraction of profit   remains for the purchase of foodstuffs, or   2. through an expansion of Lebensraum for our Volk, thereby establishing an economic   circle to secure the production of sufficient foodstuffs for Germany domestically. Since the   second approach is as yet [!] impossible to pursue due to the persistent delusions of the onetime victorious powers, we are forced to follow along the path of the first proposition. This   means we must export in order to be able to purchase food from abroad. Since these exported   goods use up raw materials which we ourselves do not possess, this means we must export yet   more goods to secure these raw materials for our economy. We are compelled not by   capitalist considerations, as this may be the case in other countries, but by dire necessity, the   most excruciating which can befall a people, namely, concern for its daily bread.   And when foreign statesmen threaten us with economic sanctions, for what reason I do   not know, then all I can do is to assure them that this would lead to a desperate struggle for   economic survival. We could far more easily hold our own in such a struggle than those other   satiated nations, for our motive for entering into this struggle would be a very simple one:   German Volk, either live, i.e. export, or perish! And I can assure all these doubters abroad that   the German Volk will not perish; it will live! And, if necessary, this German Volk will place   at its leadership’s disposal its entire capacity for work realized in the new National Socialist   community. It will take up this struggle and it will persevere in this struggle. And as far as its   leadership is concerned, I can only assure you that it stands determined to do whatever is   necessary.   A final resolution of this problem in a reasonable manner will only come about when   the greed of certain peoples has been conquered by the insights of human common sense and   reason if one accepts that insistence on injustice is not only detrimental politically, but also   useless economically, indeed that it spells insanity.   Given the present circumstances, we have no recourse other than to persist in the   continuation of our previous economic policy which must undertake to obtain the highest   yields possible from the Lebensraum available to us. This requires an ever greater increase in   our efforts and in production.   This forces us to strengthen the implementation of the Four-Year Plan. Ever more   manpower must be mobilized. And it is at this point that we enter into a new phase of   Germany’s economic policy.   In the first six years after our rise to power, it was the task of our economic leadership   to channel idle manpower into some form of productive occupation.   In the coming years, it will be their task to draw up a detailed inventory of our labor   force, to reallocate productive powers according to plan. They will need to strive for   rationalization and an improvement of operating conditions, in order to secure, while the work   input remains constant, an increase in productivity, which, in turn, frees manpower for new   additional production.   This, however, forces us to make the money market more accessible in the interest of   technical advancement of our enterprises and to relieve it from its obligations to the state.   This in turn necessitates close cooperation of economic and financial institutions. I stand   determined to bring to its conclusion the transformation of the German Reichsbank-a path   pursued ever since January 30, 1937-from an internationally controlled bankers’ enterprise to   the bank of issue of the German Reich.   If the rest of the world (ubrige Welt) laments the loss of the international character of   yet another German institution, may we point out that it is our inexorable decision to impart to   all institutions affecting our lives predominantly German, that is National Socialist,   characteristics. And perhaps this will make clear to the world the distorted nature of the claim   that we sought to force German attitudes on the rest of the world. It would be far more   justified if we in National Socialist Germany lamented that the outside world (andere Welt) is   persistently trying to force its attitudes on us.   I now hold it to be the duty, my Reichstag Deputies, of every German man and every   German woman to comprehend the conduct of the Reich’s economic policy. In the cities and   in the countryside you have to consider in particular that Germany’s economic policy is not   based on some sort of financial theory, but rather on a very primitive understanding of   production, on the realization that the sole determining factor is the quantity of goods   produced.   That we are faced with numerous other tasks, such as the necessary deployment of a   high percentage of manpower to the armament-by itself unproductive-of our Volk, is   regrettable, yet unalterable. After all, the economy of the present Reich hinges on its external   security. It is best to arrive at this realization early rather than too late. I hence see it as   imperative for the National Socialist leadership of this State to do everything humanly   possible to strengthen our defenses. I place great stock in the German Volk’s insight and,   above all, in its recollections.   We have no right to presume that, should Germany suffer yet another attack of   weakness, its destiny would take on a different appearance. To the contrary: they are in part   the very same men who once kindled the fire to scorch the entire world who today strive to   prepare the grounds for another, renewed struggle as the paid henchmen at the service of   those promoting hatred among peoples, to augment existing animosities.   Deputies, Men of the Reichstag! I implore you in particular not to forget one thing: It is   apparently one of the exquisite privileges of democratic, political livelihood, enjoyed in   certain democracies, to indulge in artificially feeding the flame of hatred against so-called   totalitarian states. By a flood of partially distorted, partially fictitious reports, these rouse   public opinion against certain peoples who have done nothing to harm others nor wish to   undertake anything of this nature, but have only suffered from the great injustice done to them   throughout the decades.   And when we venture to defend ourselves in view of the injurious attacks of such   apostles of war as the gentlemen Duff Cooper, Eden,Churchill, or Ickes, then this is portrayed   as though we were infringing on the most sacred of rights in these democracies. According to   the understanding of these gentlemen, they apparently have the unchallenged right to attack   other peoples and their leadership, but no one in turn has the right to defend himself against   these attacks. I need not assure you that, as long as the German Reich shall exist as a   sovereign state, its leadership will not allow one or another English or American politician to   forbid it to reply in kind to such attacks. In the future, the weapons we forged shall insure that   we remain such a sovereign state, as shall a great number of our friends.   Actually we could simply laugh off the libelous claim that Germany intended to attack   America. And, indeed, we would much prefer to remain silent on the topic of the campaign of   hatred pursued by certain British apostles of war and to simply ignore them. Yet we may not   forget the following: 1. The democracies in question are states in which the political structures   make it possible that, within a few months’ time, the most notorious of these warmongers may   actually have emerged as the leaders of their governments.   2. We hence owe it to the security of the Reich to enlighten the German Volk about the   true nature of these men in a timely manner. The German Volk harbors no hatred for England,   America, or France, and desires nothing other than to live calmly and peacefully, while the   Jewish and non-Jewish agitators persist in rousing the animosity of these peoples against   Germany and the German Volk. In the event that these warmongers should succeed in their   undertakings, our own Volk would be confronted with a situation incomprehensible to it, as it   was not psychologically prepared for anything of this nature.   Therefore, I believe it necessary that from now on our propaganda and press shall   answer immediately to any such attacks and inform the German Volk of them. It must know   who these men are who so desperately seek to provoke a war, no matter what the   circumstances. I am convinced that the calculations of these elements will prove faulty as   soon as National Socialist propaganda begins to reply in kind to these provocations. We shall   deal with them as successfully as we did in Germany’s interior when we wrestled the Jewish   world enemy to the ground through the forceful use of our propaganda.   The peoples of the world will realize within a short time that National Socialist   Germany does not desire to elicit the enmity of other peoples.   Allegations of the aggressive designs entertained by our Volk on other peoples are the   products of a deranged, hysterical mind or blatant lies by certain politicians struggling for   survival. In certain states, businessmen void of any conscience try to save their financial   interests by propagating these lies. Above all, it is international Jewry which seeks thereby to   gratify its thirst for vengeance and its insatiable hunger for profit.121 And this constitutes the   greatest libelous claim ever levied against a great and peace-loving Volk.   After all, German soldiers have never fought on American soil other than for the cause   of America’s independence and freedom. Yet American soldiers were shipped to Europe and   contributed to the suppression of a great nation struggling to preserve its liberty. It was not   Germany that attacked America; it was America that attacked Germany. And it did so,   according to the findings of an investigative committee in the American House of   Representatives, without any compelling reason, other than perhaps capitalist considerations.   Nevertheless, let there be no doubt as to one point: all these attempts will not in the least   sway Germany from its reckoning with Jewry. I would like to say the following on the Jewish   question: it is truly a shaming display when we see today the entire democratic world filled   with tears of pity at the plight of the poor, tortured Jewish people, while remaining   hardhearted and obstinate in view of what is therefore its obvious duty: to help. All the   arguments with which they seek to justify their non-intervention lend only further support to   the stance of Germans and Italians in this matter.   For this is what they say: “We”-that is the democracies-“cannot possibly admit the   Jews!” And this those world powers claim who can boast no more than ten persons per square   kilometer while we must accommodate and feed 135 persons per square kilometer.   Then follow assurances: “We cannot take them unless they receive a certain monetary   contribution from Germany to facilitate immigration.” Small matter that Germany has already   been good enough to provide for these elements for centuries, who possessed little more than   infectious political and sanitary diseases. What this people possesses today, it obtained at the   cost of the not-so-cunning German Volk by means of the most base manipulations.   What we do today is no more than to set right the wrongs these people committed. In   the days when the German Volk lost its savings, accumulated throughout decades of hard   work, thanks to the inflation incited and nurtured by the Jews; when the rest of the world took   the German Volk’s assets abroad; when it expropriated our colonial possessions; at that time   such philanthropic contemplations did not yet play such an influential role in these democratic   statesmen’s considerations. I wish to assure these gentle-men that, owing to a fifteen-yearlong crash course in democracy, we are today steeled against any sentimentality.   We had to live to see how, at the end of the war, after hunger and destitution had killed   more than 800,000 children of our Volk, because of the gruesome articles of a Diktat which   the democratic, humane world apostles had forced on us in the guise of a peace treaty, nearly   a million dairy cows were driven from our barns. We had to live to see, one year after the end   of the war, over one million German prisoners of war still held captive without any   perceptible cause. We had to suffer the sight of how, along our frontiers, far more than   oneand- a-half-million Germans bereft of their possessions were driven from their homes with   no more than their shirts on their backs. We had to bear the sight of millions of our   Volksgenossen torn from us, without anyone according them a hearing, and were left without   any means of sustaining themselves in the future.   I could supplement these examples by dozens of yet more gruesome ones.   Do not reproach me on the grounds of your humanitarian concerns. The German Volk   does not wish to be governed by another people; it does not wish others to determine its   affairs in its place. France to the French; England to the English; America to the Americans,   and Germany to the Germans! We are determined to undercut the efforts of a certain foreign   people to nest here; a people whose members knew how to capture all leading positions. We   will banish this people. We are willing to educate our own Volk to assume these leadership   functions. We have hundreds of thousands of the most intelligent children of peasants and   workers. We will have them educated, and we are already educating them. We are hoping that   one day we can place them in all leading positions within the state along with others from our   educated classes.   No longer shall these be occupied by members of a people alien to us.   Above all, as the literal meaning of the term already indicates, German culture is   exclusively German; it is not Jewish. Hence we shall place the administration and the care for   our culture in the hands of our Volk. Should the rest of the world be outraged and protest   hypocritically against Germany’s barbarous expulsion of such an extraordinary, culturally   valuable, irreplaceable element, then we can only be astonished at the consequences such a   stance would imply.   I believe the earlier this problem is resolved, the better. For Europe cannot find peace   before it has dealt properly with the Jewish question.   It is possible that the necessity of resolving this problem sooner or later should bring   about agreement in Europe, even between nations which otherwise might not have reconciled   themselves as readily with one another. There is more than enough room for settlement on   this earth. All we need to do is put an end to the prevailing assumption that the Dear Lord   chose the Jewish people to be the beneficiaries of a certain percentage of the productive   capacities of other peoples’ bodies and their labors. Either the Jews will have to adjust to   constructive, respectable activities, such as other people are already engaged in, or, sooner or   later, they will succumb to a crisis of yet inconceivable proportions.   And there is yet one more topic on which I would like to speak on this day, perhaps not   only memorable for us Germans: I have been a prophet very often in my lifetime, and this   earned me mostly ridicule. In the time of my struggle for power, it was primarily the Jewish   people who mocked my prophecy that, one day, I would assume leadership of this Germany,   of this State, and of the entire Volk, and that I would press for a resolution of the Jewish   question, among many other problems. The resounding laughter of the Jews in Germany then   may well be stuck in their throats today, I suspect.   Once again I will be a prophet: should the international Jewry of finance   (Finanzjudentum) succeed, both within and beyond Europe, in plunging mankind into yet   another world war, then the result will not be a Bolshevization of the earth and the victory of   Jewry, but the annihilation (Vernichtung) of the Jewish race in Europe. Thus, the days of   propagandist impotence of the non-Jewish peoples are over.   National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy possess institutions which, if necessary,   permit opening the eyes of the world to the true nature of this problem.   Many a people is instinctively aware of this, albeit not scientifically versed in it.   At this moment, the Jews are still propagating their campaign of hatred in certain states   under the cover of press, film, radio, theater, and literature, which are all in their hands.   Should indeed this one Volk attain its goal of prodding masses of millions from other peoples   to enter into a war devoid of all sense for them, and serving the interests of the Jews   exclusively, then the effectiveness of an enlightenment will once more display its might.   Within Germany, this enlightenment conquered Jewry utterly in the span of a few years.   Peoples desire not to perish on the battlefield just so that this rootless, internationalist   race can profit financially from this war and thereby gratify its lust for vengeance derived   from the Old Testament. The Jewish watchword “Proletarians of the world, unite!” will be   conquered by a far more lofty realization, namely: “Creative men of all nations, recognize   your common foe!”   Among the reproaches which the so-called democracies have heaped on Germany has   been the claim that National Socialist Germany is a state hostile to religion. On this topic, I   wish to make the following solemn declaration before the entire German Volk:   1. To date, no one has been persecuted because of his religious affinity in Germany, nor   will anyone be persecuted for this reason in the future either.   2. Since January 30, 1933, the official institutions within the National Socialist State   have transferred the following tax earnings to the two Churches: 130 million Reichsmarks for   the fiscal year 1933; 170 million Reichsmarks for the fiscal year 1934; 250 million   Reichsmarks for the fiscal year 1935; 320 million Reichsmarks for the fiscal year 1936; 400   million Reichsmarks for the fiscal year 1937; 500 million Reichsmarks for the fiscal year   1938. In addition to this, the Church receives approximately 85 million Reichs-marks   annually in the form of Lander subsidies, and approximately another seven million   Reichsmarks in the form of subsidies by the local communities and associations. Next to the   State, the Church constitutes the greatest proprietor of land. It possesses holdings in real estate   and forestry in excess of ten billion Reichsmarks. From these, it derives annual earnings of   about 300 million.   Moreover, the Church benefits from countless gifts, bequests, and, above all, from   donations collected. Further, the National Socialist State accords the Church concessions in a   variety of realms: donations and inheritance are taxexempt for instance. To make an   understatement, therefore, it is with insolent impertinence that foreign politicians accuse the   Third Reich of hostility to religion. Should the churches within Germany regard the situation   as unbearable, then please bear in mind that the National Socialist State is willing, and   prepared at any time, to undertake a clear separation of church and state, as is the case in   France, America, and other countries. In this context, I permit myself to pose the following   question: Within this period, how much did official state appropriations to the church amount   to in France, England, and the USA?   3. The National Socialist State has not closed even one single church, neither prevented   church services nor infringed on the conduct of Mass. It has not imposed its views on any   confession’s church doctrine and faith. In the National Socialist State, man is free to seek   absolution in the fashion desired.   However, the National Socialist State will relentlessly deal with those priests who,   instead of serving the Lord, see their mission in propagating derisive comments on our present   Reich, its institutions, or its leading men. It will bring to their attention the fact that the   destruction of this State will not be tolerated.   The law will prosecute a priest who implicates himself in illegal activities and he will be   held accountable for these in the same manner as any other, ordinary German citizen. It must,   however, be stated at this point that there are thousands upon thousands of priests of all   Christian beliefs who attend to their clerical duties in a manner infinitely superior to these   clerical warmongers and without entering into conflict with the established law and order. To   protect these is the mission of the State. To destroy the enemies of the State is the duty of the   State.   4. The National Socialist State is neither prudish nor hypocritical. Still there are certain   fundamental mores which must be upheld in the interest of preserving the biological health of   the Volk. And we shall not allow these to be altered. This State prosecutes pederasty and child   abuse as crimes to be punished by the law, irrespective of who perpetrates them. Five years   ago, when leading members of the National Socialist Party were guilty of these crimes, they   were shot. Should other men perpetrate similar transgressions, whether in public, privately, or   as members of the clergy, the law will duly prosecute them and sentence them to serve time.   Should men of the cloth perpetrate other transgressions, in violation of their avowal of   chastity etc., then it is of no interest to us. There has been no mention of this in our press ever.   And besides this, this State has interfered only once in the inner organization of the churches,   namely on the occasion when, in 1933, I myself attempted to reunite the impotent, fragmented   Protestant Land Churches of Germany in the form of a great and mighty Protestant Reich   Church. This attempt ran aground on the opposition of individual Lander bishops. And   therefore I abandoned my efforts since, in the final instance, it is not our task to strengthen or   to defend by force the Protestant Church against its own leaders.   The motivation behind certain statesmen in the democracies abroad taking such a   vigorous interest in a few German priests is obviously political.   For these very same democratic statesmen remained silent when in Russia hundreds of   thousands of priests were hacked to pieces and their bodies burnt. These democratic statesmen   remained equally silent at the brutal slaughter of priests and nuns in Spain, numbering in the   tens of thousands, some of whom were even burnt alive. These democratic statesmen could   not deny these facts, but they remained silent and nothing broke this silence. In the meantime,   upon news of these massacres-and of this I must indeed remind these democratic statesmencountless National Socialists and Fascist volunteers placed themselves at General Franco’s   disposal. They did so with the aim of precluding an escalation of the conflict, to prevent this   Bolshevist bloodbath from enveloping all of Europe and hence the greater part of the civilized   world.   It was concern for European culture and the essence of civilization which led Germany   to take sides in this struggle between Nationalist Spain and the Bolshevists who attempted to   destroy it. It is indeed a pitiful sign of the mentality abroad that people there cannot conceive   of so selfless an intervention.   Alas, National Socialists shared in General Franco’s uprising because of their burning   desire to promote his cause: to avert the danger threatening to engulf his country, a danger   Germany itself had almost succumbed to.   Therefore, it cannot be sympathy or pity for persecuted servants of God that has   mobilized the interest of the democratic citizens in some priests in Germany who have come   into conflict with the law. Rather these interest them as German enemies of the state. May   they note the following on this topic: we shall protect the German priest as a servant of the   Lord, but we shall destroy the priest who is a political foe of the German Reich. We believe   this will preclude the development of a situation which, as the experience in Spain has   demonstrated, could all too easily escalate into a confrontation of as yet unforeseeable   proportions.   As a matter of principle, I should like to state the following on this subject: apparently,   certain circles abroad are pervaded by the conviction that the outspoken avowal of sympathy   for certain elements who have come into conflict with the law in Germany would bring about   an improvement of their situation. In this context, there is perhaps the hope of terrorizing the   leadership of the German State by employing certain methods of exerting influence through   the media.   This assessment rests on a profound fallacy. For the credence lent to these individuals   abroad, and hence implicitly to their anti-governmental activities, merely reassures us in our   earlier conviction that the characters in question are in fact traitors. After all, simple   opposition to a regime has never elicited equal sympathy from these democracies abroad; and   neither has the prosecution nor the sentencing of an individual in political opposition. For   when was there ever a stronger opposition movement in Germany than the National Socialist   one? Never were political adversaries suppressed by like base means, persecuted, and hunted   as those of the National Socialist Party. To us it is an honor never to have partaken in the   sympathy and support extended by a foreign government. Evidently, such support is lent   exclusively to those who aim to destroy the German Reich. Hence, in our eyes, the display of   such support would indicate the necessity to step up measures previously taken in any such   case.   In view of the dangers enveloping us today, I regard it as most fortunate to have found   states within Europe and beyond Europe which, like the German Volk, have had to struggle   hard to preserve their existence: Italy and Japan. In the Occident, Italy and Germany today   constitute the most ancient peoples, Italians as the descendants of Ancient Rome and Germans   as the descendants of the Germanic tribes, and hence we have been in touch with one another   the longest. Already on the occasion of my speech in the Palazzo Venezia in Rome during my   visit to Italy, I underlined the tragic nature of the centuries-long and fruitless confrontation   between this most mighty of cultured peoples of the Ancient world and the young German   Volk, which belonged to a new world coming into being. These clashes were due largely to   the lack of any natural frontier separating the two peoples and to a multitude of other   circumstances.   But from these contacts throughout the millenniums sprang a community, one tied not   only by linkage of blood, but by a shared historical and cultural past, a heritage of supreme   significance. What precisely the Germanic peoples owe to Antiquity in terms of the evolution   of statehood, realization of ethnic affinity, and in the sphere of general cultural development,   defies measurement and description in its totality. Two thousand years have passed since. And   the time came when we ourselves were called on to make a contribution, and we did so   generously. Throughout, we remained closely linked to the Italian people, spiritually,   culturally, and historically.   The 19th century heralded a process of political unification, strikingly alike in both   instances. The Germanic tribes united in the German Reich, the Italian people came together   in the Italian Kingdom. And the year 1866 even witnessed both peoples entering side by side   into the struggle to form new states. Now, for a second time, these peoples are experiencing a   similar development. A man of secular standing was the first to oppose successfully to the   democratic world of ideas, which had become barren, a forceful new idea which reigned   victorious within a few years’ time. What Fascism means to Italy is difficult to imagine. What   it has contributed to the preservation of the culture of man is of astronomic proportions.   Striding through Rome or Florence, who can help being overcome by the contemplation   of what fate these unique monuments of human creativity might have met with had it not been   for Mussolini and Fascism, which pulled Italy back from the brink of Bolshevist oblivion?   Germany, too, faced this danger. Here National Socialism wrought the miracle of rescue. And   the belief in a new Renaissance in our day and age clings to these two states in the   imagination of countless men of all races. The solidarity between these two regimes   represents far more than simple, egotistical self-interest. This solidarity holds the promise of   Europe’s rescue from its threatened destruction by Bolshevism.   As Italy strode forth in its heroic struggle for its right to existence in Abyssinia,   Germany sided with it as its friend. This friendship was more than repaid in the year 1938.   May no one in the world doubt National Socialist Germany’s loyalty, in which it shall not   waver. In the interest of peace, let there remain no doubts that, should any power initiate   hostilities against Italy, for whatever reason, this will automatically call Germany to its   friend’s side. Above all, one should not heed false council by those who vegetate in the   various countries as isolated, bourgeois weaklings who fail to comprehend that in the life of   nations, wisdom implies not cowardice, but courage and honor.   As regards National Socialist Germany, it is painfully aware of the destiny awaiting it   should Fascist Italy be wrestled to the ground by an international agglomeration of forces,   irrespective of pretenses. We know these consequences and we shall cold-bloodedly (eiskalt)   look them straight in the eye.   There will not be a repetition of the fate of Prussia from 1805 to 1806 in German   history. Those weaklings who then counseled the King of Prussia counsel no one in today’s   Germany. The National Socialist State knows of the inherent dangers and undertakes the   necessary steps to prepare for its defense.   Just as I know our own Wehrmacht is quite capable of standing up even under the   greatest of strains of a military nature, I know this to be true of the military might of Italy. For   as no one can judge the present German Army by the standards of the old Federal Army   around 1848, no one can assess the present Fascist Italy by the standards of the old, warring   Italian states. Only a hysterical, mean-spirited press, as obstinate as it is tactless, can so   quickly repress memories of the embarrassment it suffered through its false prophecies of   Italy’s Abyssinian campaign. And its present assessment of the Nationalist forces under   General Franco affords it a similar embarrassment once over.   Men make history! They forge the tools to mold history and, above all, they lend them   their spirit. Great men are no more than the strongest, most concentrated representation of a   Volk. National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy are sufficiently strong to secure peace in   the face of any infringement and stand determined to bring to a successful close this conflict   which irresponsible forces have far too thoughtlessly embarked on.   This does not mean we Germans desire war, as an irresponsible press would like to have   it, but that we   1. appreciate other peoples’ wish to secure for themselves a share in the goods of this   world, in accordance with their numbers, their courage, and their intrinsic value, and that   therefore we   2. recognize these rights which oblige us to take a common stance in the pursuit of our   common interests.   Above all, we shall not yield to threats or attempts at blackmail under any   circumstances! Our relations to Japan are determined by this realization and the firm   determination to arrest the menace of a progressive Bolshevization of a world blind to this   danger. One day, the Anti-Comintern Pact may be appreciated as a focal point around which   gathered a group of powers whose most salient ambition lay in the thwarting of this satanic   phenomenon imperiling peace and culture worldwide. Within the past two years, the Japanese   people has repeatedly and tangibly demonstrated its splendid heroism and, undoubtedly, it is a   swordsman in the service of mankind on the other side of the globe. Its potential collapse   would be to the detriment of the cultured peoples within Europe and beyond and would   irrevocably herald the Bolshevization of the Far East. And no people can wish for such a   development, other than perhaps international Jewry, which has an interest in this, too.   And if indeed in this past year mighty exertions were permitted to come to a peaceful   conclusion, then we are grateful for this not only to Mussolini. As mentioned in the first part   of this speech, we extend our thanks also to those other two statesmen who, in the hour of   critical decision, valued peace more highly than persistence in a wrong. Germany places no   territorial demands on either England or France, other than perhaps a restitution of its former   colonies.   Yet, although a resolution of this question is highly desirable, this issue most assuredly   does not warrant the outbreak of open hostilities.   If Europe today is plagued by strenuous tensions, then this is due primarily to agitation   in an unaccountable and irresponsible press. It allows not a single day to pass by without   spreading disquiet among mankind by propagating false alarms, as ludicrous as they are   libelous. The liberties taken in this context by the various organs of this worldwide poisoning   of wells (Weltbrunnenvergiftung) can be regarded only as criminal wrong-doing. In recent   days, there has been an attempt to place radio journalism at the service of this internationally   instigated campaign. I wish to pronounce this warning here: if certain countries do not   immediately desist from airing broadcasts targeted at Germany, then we shall respond   accordingly. And then I hope statesmen from these countries will not venture to approach me   with the sincere desire to restore normal relations between our states.   For I remain convinced that our educational campaign will be far more effective than   the campaign of lies instigated by these international Jewish agitators. And the announcement   of American film companies of their intention to produce anti-Nazi-i.e. anti-German-films,   will only lead to our German producers creating anti-Semitic films in the future. And in this   instance, too, certain elements would do well not to deceive themselves as to the effect: a   multitude of states and peoples exist today who would be most receptive to such an   educational campaign expanding their comprehension of this important issue.   I believe that, should we succeed in arresting the activities of the Jewishinternational   press agitators and their propaganda, then a reconciliation between peoples would be speedily   attained. These elements alone persistently place their hopes on war. I, however, believe in a   long-lasting peace.   For is there truly a conflict of interest between England and Germany, for instance? I   have often enough stated that there is no German man and especially no National Socialist   who even as much as dreams of interfering with the vested interest of the British Empire. And   repeatedly the voice of reason was heard to reign in England as well, and we have indeed   heard of Englishmen whose calm reflection has led them to espouse a similar stance toward   Germany.   It would be a cause for great happiness throughout the world, should these two peoples   enter into confiding cooperation with each other. And the same holds true for our relations   with France.   These days bear witness to the fifth anniversary of the conclusion of our NonAggression Pact with Poland. There is little dissent today among those who truly love peace   as to the value of this agreement. Just imagine where developments might have taken Europe   in the interim, had it not been for the conclusion of this pact which truly signaled a great relief   for all involved.   Poland’s most outstanding marshal and patriot rendered his people as great a service as   the National Socialist State’s leadership rendered the German Volk.   And, in the course of the tense months last year, German-Polish friendship became a   reassuring factor in the otherwise troubled political life in Europe.   Our relations with Hungary are based on a long-standing, well-tried friendship and   shared interests. Each people has traditionally avowed its high regard for the other. Germany   rejoiced in participating in the restitution for a misfortune inflicted on Hungary.   One state that has commanded our Volk’s attention ever since the Great War has been   Yugoslavia. The high regard which German soldiers once felt for this valiant people has   become ever the more profound and has fostered the development of a sincere friendship. A   sharp increase in trade has marked our economic relations with Yugoslavia, as with states   friendly to us such as Bulgaria, Greece, Rumania, and Turkey. The primary cause has lain in   the complementary nature of these economies to the German one.   Germany today considers itself fortunate to possess pacified frontiers to the West,   South, and North. Our close relations to states in the West and in the North, i.e. to   Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Baltic   States, are the cause of further rejoicing, all the more so as recent times have witnessed an   increasing tendency to renounce certain war-laden paragraphs of the League of Nations.141 To   a greater extent that any other state, Germany appreciates knowing that truly friendly neutral   states reside along its borders. May Czechoslovakia succeed in its search for inner peace and   the restoration of law and order so as to preclude a relapse into the times of former State   President Beneš. The adherence of Bulgaria and Manchukuo to the Anti-Comintern Pact143 is   an agreeable symptom of resistance worldwide to the threat posed by Jewishinternationalist,   Bolshevist agitation.   The amicable relations between the German Reich and the South American states are at   present being invigorated in the economic sphere.   Our relations with the North American Union have suffered unduly because of a smear   campaign. With the pretext that Germany threatens America’s independence and even its   liberty, it has placed an entire continent at the service of all too transparent political and   financial interests. These are attempting to agitate against those European states governed by   the people for the people. All of us are aware that these elements are not representative of the   will of millions of American citizens who do not doubt for one minute, despite bombardment   by a ‘gigantic Jewish-capitalist instigated propaganda campaign-via press, radio, and film-that   there is not a word of truth in all these claims. Germany desires to live in peace and friendship   with all countries, America included. It declines any involvement in America’s internal affairs   and hence, equally vigorously, it rejects American involvement in Germany’s internal affairs.   Whether or not Germany seeks maintenance of economic ties or promotes business with   the states of Latin America is really not the business of anyone but these states themselves.   Germany is a sovereign state and a great Reich. Its policies are not subject to revision by   American politicians. In any event, I believe that all the world’s states face so many urgent   problems at home these days that their peoples would undoubtedly be glad if the statesmen   responsible accorded greater attention to domestic issues in their own countries. As concerns   Germany, my own experiences have taught me that the tasks to be mastered are so great that   they are almost beyond a single man’s capacity for insight and concerted action. I can   therefore state, both on behalf of my staff and myself, that we are dedicating our lives   exclusively to the maintenance and sustenance of our Volk and Reich, both of which can   proudly look back on a glorious history spanning the millenniums.   My Deputies, Men of the First Greater German Reichstag! As I conclude my   explanations today, the years of struggle and fulfillment lying behind us now pass once more   before my mind’s eye. To many these meant the sense and purpose of their entire existence.   We know that greater things cannot be granted to our Volk and our own lives.   Without shedding a drop of blood, we succeeded in raising up this great Reich of the   German Volk. Let us not forget, however, that this process meant painful sacrifices for some   of us: the erasing of many Lander structures; the lowering of their banners; the oblivion of   their local traditions. Yet may it be of consolation to these men that no generation involved in   the constructive process of our history has been spared similarly painful experiences. Ever   since the first German dukes labored to form wild tribes into higher unions, their endeavors   had to obliterate institutions grown dear, cherished recollections, manly pledges of loyalty,   and so on.   It was nearly two thousand years before the scattered Germanic tribes emerged as one   people; before the countless lands and states forged one Reich.   We may now consider this process of the formation of the German nation as having   reached its conclusion. The creation of the Greater German Reich represents the culmination   of our Volk’s thousand-year struggle for existence.   As streams of German blood flow together therein, so do traditions of times past, their   standards and symbols, and, above all else, all the great men of whom their contemporaries   were rightly proud. Small matter whose side they stood on in their day, all those daring dukes,   great kings, formidable warlords, mighty emperors, and around them the inspired geniuses   and heroes of the past served as instruments of Providence in the formative process of a   nation. Insofar as we embrace this great Reich in grateful reverence, the wealth of German   history reveals itself to us in all its splendor. Let us thank the Lord Almighty for bestowing on   our generation the great blessing to be alive at this time and this hour.\"\n",

            "        \"transcript\":\"A year filled with world historic events is drawing to a close; a year of great  decisions stands before us. In these grave times, I speak to you, Deputies of the  Reichstag, as the representatives of the German nation. But, beyond this, the whole  German Volk should take note of this review and of the decisions that the present and the  future force on us.  After another rejection of my peace proposal by the present British prime minister and  the clique that supports or controls him, it became clear by the autumn of 1940 that this war,  contrary to all reason and necessity, had to be fought to the end with arms. You know me, my  party comrades. I have always been against halfhearted or weak decisions. If Providence  wished that the German Volk could not be spared this fight, then I would be grateful to it for  entrusting me with the waging of a historic struggle which will decisively fashion not only our  Germany history for the next thousand years, but also the history of Europe-even the history  of the entire world.  The German Volk and its soldiers today fight not only for themselves and their own  time, but also for coming generations-even the most distant ones.  The Creator entrusted us with a historic revision of unique scope, which we now are  obligated to see through. The armistice in the west, which had become possible immediately  after the end of fighting in Norway, forced the German leadership first to militarily secure the  conquered territories of political, strategic, and economic significance.  In this way, the power of resistance of the territories conquered at the time has changed.  A belt of bases and fortifications of great proportions stretches from Kirkenes to the Spanish  border.  Countless airfields have been built. In the north, sometimes they had to be blasted into  prehistorical granite. Naval bases were furnished with shelters in such numbers and of such  strength that they cannot practically be harmed either from the sea or from the air. For their  defense, there are more than oneand- a-half thousand new batteries whose positions had to be  reconnoitered, planned, and built. A network of streets and railroads was designed in such a  manner that the link between the Spanish border and Petsamo today is secured, irrespective of  the sea. Engineering and construction battalions of the navy, the army, and the Luftwaffe, in  connection with the Todt Organization, have created installations here that are not inferior to  the West Wall in any way. We continue to work persistently on reinforcing them. It is my  imperturbable resolve to make this European front unassailable for every enemy. This  defensive work, which continued throughout the last winter, was supplemented by an  offensive conduct of the war insofar as this was possible, given the seasonal conditions.  German surface craft and submarine naval forces continue to wage their constant war of  destruction against the British Navy and Merchant Marine and against those in its service. By  flying reconnaissance and attacks, the German Luftwaffe lent support to the destruction of  enemy tonnage. In countless retaliation attacks, it gave the English a better idea of the “lovely  war,” whose mastermind has been primarily its present prime minister.  In this struggle, in the middle of last year, Germany received the support above all of its  Italian allies. For many months, the weight of a large part of the British power lay on the  shoulders of the allied Italian state. Only because of an enormous superiority in heavy tanks,  the English succeeded in bringing about a temporary crisis in North Africa.  As early as on March 24 of last year, a small group of German-Italian units, led by  Rommel, started a counterattack. Ajdabiyah fell on April 2. Benghazi was reached on April 4.  Our common units moved into Darnah on April 8.  Tobruk was surrounded on April 11. Bardiyah was occupied on April 12. The  accomplishments of the German Africa Corps were all the more outstanding because this  theater of war was completely foreign and [its climate was] unlike the German climate. Just as  in Spain once, Germans and Italians again fought the same enemy together, [this time] in  North Africa.  While, with the blood of German and Italian soldiers, these daring measures again  secured the North African front of our two allied countries, a dreadful danger cast its long,  ominous shadows on Europe.  Bowing to bitter necessity, I decided in the autumn of 1939 at least to attempt the  elimination of the acute German-Russian tensions in order to create the prerequisites for a  general peace. Psychologically, this was difficult because of the overall attitude of the  German Volk and especially the party toward Bolshevism. Technically, however, this was  easy because Germany had always had and pursued only economic interests in those areas  that England declared were threatened by us and which it assaulted with pacts of assistance.  Deputies, Men of the German Reichstag, I may remind you that, in the early summer  and midsummer of 1939, England again offered its assistance to numerous states and  countries, claiming that Germany intended to invade them and rob them of their freedom. The  German Reich and its government could, with a clear conscience, assure them that these were  mere allegations which did not in any way correspond to the truth.  In addition, there was the sober military realization that, in the event of a war forced on  the German Volk by British diplomacy, fighting on two fronts would at any rate lead to very  heavy sacrifices. Moreover, once the Baltic states, Romania, and others, were inclined to  accept the British pacts of assistance and thereby showed that they also believed in such a  threat, it was not only the right of the German Reich government, but also a duty, on its own  responsibility, to delineate German interests.  To the great regret of the German Reich, these countries shortly realized that the only  factor that could constitute a strong guarantee against the threat from the east was Germany.  They were lost, since their own policy had severed their ties to the German Reich, and since  they had entrusted themselves to the assistance of that power whose notorious egotism  throughout the centuries has never afforded anyone any assistance, but instead has always  asked for the help of others.  Nevertheless, the fate of these countries evoked strong sympathy from the German  Volk. The sentiments that the winter war of the Finns forced on us were a mixture of  bitterness and admiration. As a military people, our hearts went out to them in admiration of  their heroism and self-sacrifice. We felt bitter because, in view of the enemy threatening us in  the west and danger in the east, we were unable to help militarily.  As soon as it became clear to us that Russia practically derived the right, from the  delineation of Germany’s political spheres of interest, to kill off the nations living outside of  them, further relations served only as a means to an end and were contrary to reason and  sentiment.  As early as the year 1940, we realized more and more each month that the plans of the  men in the Kremlin aimed at the domination of Europe and, thereby, its destruction. At a time  when Germany had only a few divisions in the area bordering on Russia, I already explained  to the nation the concentration of Russian military power in the east. Only a blind man could  have failed to see that this concentration was of such unique dimensions that it would have an  impact on world history. And this was not to defend something that was not threatened, but to  attack something that appeared unable to defend itself. Even if the lightning end of the  campaign in the west prevented the ruling powers in Moscow from counting on an immediate  exhaustion of the German Reich, it did not destroy their plans. Instead, it merely postponed  the date of the attack. They felt that the summer of 1941 was a most opportune moment to  strike. A new Mongol invasion would sweep across Europe.  At the same time, Mr. Churchill promised a change in the British fight against  Germany. Today, he cowardly seeks to deny that, in the secret session of the House of  Commons in the year 1940, he pointed to the Soviet entry into the war as a crucial factor in  the successful continuation and ending of the war.  This entry would take place at the latest in the year 1941 and would also enable England  to take the offensive.  There was a time when Europe was that Greek island into which Nordic tribes  penetrated in order to light the flame for the first time that has since slowly but steadily begun  to enlighten the world of man. And as these Greeks parried the invasion of the Persian  conquerors, they were not only defending their own homeland, which was Greece, but also  that idea that today is called Europe.  And then Europe moved from Hellas to Rome.  Greek spirit and Greek civilization united with Roman thinking and Roman  statesmanship. An empire was created which even today is not equaled in significance and  fertility, not to mention surpassed. As the Roman legions defended Italy against the African  assault of Carthage in three difficult wars and finally secured the victory, again it was not  Rome that they were fighting for, but the Roman-Greek world-the Europe of the day.  The next invasion of this new human civilization’s native soil issued from the expanses  of the east. A dreadful storm of uncivilized hordes poured out of inner Asia deep into the  heart of today’s European continent, burning, pillaging, murdering, like a true scourge of  God.  In the Battle on the Catalaunian Field, Romans and Teutons joined together for the first  time to defend that civilization in a struggle of unforeseeable significance. Starting with the  Greeks, this civilization first cast its spell on the Romans and now finally on the Germanic  people.  Europe grew. Hellas and Rome developed into the Occident. For many centuries, its  defense was the task not only of the Romans, but also in particular of the Germanic people.  The term Europe experienced a spatial expansion. The degree to which the Occident,  enlightened by Greek civilization and inspired by the mighty heritage of the Roman Empire,  expanded its space through Germanic colonization, irrespective of whether a German emperor  fended off invasions from the east at the Unstrut or on the Lechfeld, or whether Africa was  forced to retreat from Spain in long battles, it was always the struggle of the developing  Europe against a profoundly alien, surrounding world. While Rome had earned undying merit  in the creation and defense of this continent, the Germanic people now took over the defense  and protection of a family of nations. Irrespective of how each nation’s political designs and  ambitions differed and diverged, as a whole, this family of nations formed one unit in terms of  blood and culture, while its various parts either equaled or complemented one another.  And not only did the settlement of other parts of the world start out from this continent,  so did a spiritual and cultural fertilization, as any man who is willing to search for the truth,  instead of denying it is aware.  Therefore, England did not cultivate this continent, but splinters of the Germanic people  of our continent moved to this island as Anglo-Saxons and Normans, and made possible a  development that is certainly unique. And likewise, America did not discover Europe, but the  other way around. And everything that America did not get from Europe may seem admirable  to a Jewish mixed race. But Europe sees it as a sign of the decline of art and civilized living,  as the heritage of Jewish and Negro blood.  My Deputies! Men of the German Reichstag! I have to make these detailed statements  because the struggle, which in the first months of this year slowly began to emerge as  inevitable and which primarily the leadership of the German Reich is called on to lead this  time, goes far beyond the interests of our own Volk and country. It was not Rome that the  Greeks [sic!] once defended against Carthage. It was not the Occident that the Romans and  the Germanic people defended against the Huns. It was not Germany that the German  emperors defended against the Mongols. It was not Spain that the Spanish heroes defended  against Africa. Instead, it was Europe that all of them defended. In the same way today,  Germany does not fight for itself, but for the continent that belongs to all.  Therefore, it is fortunate that this realization has imprinted itself so profoundly into the  subconscious of most European people that, either through comments or the flow of  volunteers, they participate in this struggle.  When the German and Italian armies deployed on April 6 of this year for the attack  against Yugoslavia and Greece, it was the prelude to the great struggle in which we are still  involved at the present. The revolt which led to the overthrow of the former prince regent and  his government in Belgrade decided the further course of events in this part of Europe. While  England was prominently involved in this putsch, the leading role was played by the Soviet  Union. Mr. Stalin believed that he could obtain, via a revolutionary movement, against our  will what I had refused Mr. Molotov on the occasion of his visit to Berlin. Without paying  heed to the concluded treaties, the Bolshevik rulers expanded their goals. The friendship pact  with the new revolutionary regime revealed like lightning the closeness of the danger.  What the German Wehrmacht accomplished in this campaign was honored by the  German Reichstag on May 4, 1941. What I was regrettably unable to express at the time was  the realization that we were heading at breakneck speed toward a confrontation with a state  that did not intervene at the time of the campaign in the Balkans only because its  concentration of troops had not yet been completed and because it had not been able to utilize  the airfields because of the thaw which sets in during this season and turns the runways  muddy.  My Deputies! Men of the German Reichstag! As soon as I became aware, in the year  1940, through information received from the English House of Commons and observations of  Russian troop movements along our borders, that there was the possibility of a danger  developing to the east of the Reich, I immediately ordered the activation of numerous new  panzer, motorized, and infantry divisions. The prerequisites for this were amply fulfilled as  regards both personnel and materiel. I can assure you, my Deputies, and the entire German  Volk of one thing: even if they do understandably talk about armament a lot in the  democracies, we nevertheless work far more in National Socialist Germany. It was this way in  the past, and it is no different today. Every year will find us with more and, above all, with  improved weapons where decisions are made.  In spite of seeing the necessity of under no circumstances offering the enemy the  possibility of delivering the first strike at our heart, the decision was nonetheless very difficult  in this case. If the authors of articles in our democratic newspapers today claim that, realizing  the strength of the Bolshevik enemy, I decided to attack, then they misjudge both the situation  and my mind.  I was not looking for a war. On the contrary, I did everything to avoid it.  However, I would have been derelict in my duties and irresponsible, had I failed to act  on the possible consequences in spite of realizing the inevitability of the clash of arms. Since I  regarded the Soviet Union as a deadly danger not only to the German Reich but also to all of  Europe, I was determined, if possible, to give the sign to attack a few days before this  confrontation broke out. Today, we have truly crushing and authentic material to prove that  Russia intended to attack. Likewise, we are aware of the time chosen for the attack. In view of  the great danger, the full extent of which we realize perhaps only today, I can only thank the  Lord for enlightening me at the right moment and giving me the strength to do what had to be  done. Not only millions of German soldiers owe their life to Him, but so does all of Europe.  Because-I can say this today-had this wave of more than twenty thousand [Soviet]  tanks, hundreds of divisions, tens of thousands of guns, accompanied by more than ten  thousand planes, unexpectedly started to move across the Reich, then Europe would have  been lost. Fate has chosen a number of nations to risk their blood in order to prevent this  blow, or rather to parry it. Had Finland not been immediately determined to take up arms a  second time, then the easy middle-class way of life in the other Nordic states would quickly  have come to an end.  Had the German Reich not confronted this enemy with its soldiers and arms, then a  wave would have swept over Europe that would have taken care of the ridiculous British idea  of the balance of power in Europe in all its banality and stupid tradition-once and for all.  Had not Slovaks, Hungarians, and Romanians also taken on the defense of this  European world, then the Bolshevik hordes, like Attila’s gangs of Huns, would have roared  across the Danubian lands and then today Tartars and Mongols would stand at the Ionian Sea,  forcing a revision of the treaty of Montreux. Had not Italy, Spain, and Croatia sent their  divisions, then the resistance of the European front would not have developed, which, as the  proclamation of a new Europe, has won over all other nations. With this anticipation, they  came as volunteers from northern and western Europe: Norwegians, Danes, Dutch, Flemish,  Belgians, even Frenchmen. They gave the struggle of the powers allied to the Axis the  character of a European crusade, in the true sense of the word. It is not yet the right time to  speak about the planning and conduct of this campaign. Alas, I believe that I can now already  point out, in a few sentences, what has been accomplished in this mightiest struggle of all  time, in which the impressions are all too often blurry and fade in our memories because of  the vastness of the space and the multitude and power of the events.  On June 22, the attack began at daybreak. With irresistible daring, the border  fortifications were broken down, fortifications which had been intended to protect against  surprise from the Russian concentration against us. Grodno fell as early as June 22. After the  conquest of Brest-Litovsk on June 23, the citadel was overwhelmed, and Vilnius and Kaunas  [Kovno] were taken. On June 26, Daugavpils fell.  On July 10, the first two great battles of encirclement at Belostok (Bialyostok) and  Minsk were concluded. A total of three hundred twenty-four thousand prisoners, thirty-three  hundred and thirty-two tanks, eighteen hundred and nine guns fell into our hands. By July 13,  there already was a breakthrough at almost all the decisive points of the Stalin Line. On July  16, Smolensk fell after heavy fighting, while, on July 19, German and Romanian units forced  the crossing of the Dniester.  On August 6, the battle of Smolensk ended in many pockets. Again three hundred ten  thousand Russians marched into German captivity, while thirtytwo hundred and five tanks  and thirty-one hundred twenty guns were partly destroyed, partly taken as booty. And three  days later, a further Russian army group met its fate. On August 9, a hundred three thousand  Soviets were taken prisoner in the battle of Uman, three hundred seventeen tanks and eleven  hundred guns were either destroyed or captured.  On August 15, Nikolayev fell. On the 21st, Kherson was taken. On the same day, the  battle near Gomel ended; eighty-four thousand prisoners, a hundred forty-four tanks, and  eight hundred forty-eight guns were captured or destroyed.  On August 21, Russian positions between the Ilmen and Chudskoye lakes were broken  up, while, on August 26, the bridgehead across the Dnieper around Dnepropetrovsk fell into  our hands.  On the 28th of the same month, German troops moved into Reval [Tallinn] and Baltic  Port [sic] after heavy fighting, while the Finns took Vyborg on August 30. With the conquest  of Schlusselburg on September 8, Petersburg [Leningrad] was also sealed off to the south for  good.  On September 16, we succeeded in establishing bridgeheads across the Dnieper. As  early as September 18, Poltava fell into the hands of our soldiers.  On September 19, German units stormed the citadel of Kiev. And, on September 22, the  conquest of Oesel [Saaremaa] was crowned by the taking of the capital.  It was only now that the bigger operations began to bear fruit in unexpected successes.  On September 27, the battle at Kiev was concluded. Six hundred sixty-five thousand prisoners  began to move westward in endless columns; eight hundred eighty-four tanks and thirty-one  hundred seventy-eight guns remained behind in the pockets as booty. As early as October 2, a  breakthrough battle began at the center of the eastern front, while, on October 11, the battle at  the Sea of Azov ended in victory. Again, a hundred seven thousand prisoners, two hundred  twelve tanks, and six hundred seventy-two guns were counted. On October 16, after a hard  battle, German and Romanian units entered Odessa. On October 18, the breakthrough battle at  the center of the front, which had begun on October 2, ended in a new success, unique in  world history. The result was six hundred sixty-three thousand prisoners, twelve hundred  forty-two tanks, and fifty-four hundred fifty-two guns destroyed or captured. On October 21,  the conquest of Dago (Hiiumaa) was completed. On October 24, the industrial center Kharkov  was taken. On October 28, after hard fighting, a gateway to the Crimea was forced open. As  early as November 2, the capital Simferopol was stormed. On November 16, the Crimean  Peninsula was cut through at Kerch. On December 1, the total number of captured Soviets  stood at three million eight hundred six thousand eight hundred sixty-five The number of  destroyed or captured tanks was twenty-one thousand three hundred ninety-one, the number  of guns thirty-two thousand five hundred forty-one, and the number of planes fourteen  thousand three hundred twenty-two.  In the same period, twenty-one hundred ninety-one British planes were downed. The  navy sank four million one hundred seventy thousand six hundred eleven GRT (gross register  tons), while the Luftwaffe sank two million three hundred forty-six thousand one hundred  eighty GRT. Altogether, six million five hundred sixteen thousand seven hundred ninety-one  GRT were destroyed.  My Deputies! My German Volk! These are sober facts and perhaps dry figures. May  they never fade from the history and, above all, from the conscience and memory of our own  German Volk. For behind these figures are hidden the accomplishments, the sacrifices, the  privations, the heroism, and the readiness to die of millions of the best men of our own Volk  and of the allied states.  All this had to be fought for at the risk of life and limb, and with efforts of which the  homeland has hardly any idea.  Marching endless distances, tortured by heat and thirst, often driven to despair by  muddy roads, at the mercy of the rigors of the climate from the White to the Black Sea, from  the scorching heat of the days of July and August to the winter storms of November and  December, tormented by insects, suffering from the dirt and the bugs, freezing in the snow  and ice: that is how the Germans fought, and the Finns, the Italians, the Slovaks, the  Hungarians and Romanians, the Croats, the volunteers from the northern and western  European countries; all the soldiers of the eastern front.  I do not want to name any branch of the service today, I do not want to praise any  leader: they all gave their best. And yet, insight and justice compel me to state one thing: of  all our German soldiers, our unique infantry bears the greatest burden of the battle in this  struggle, today as well as in former times.  From June 22 to December 1, the German Army lost in this heroic struggle: a hundred  fifty-eight thousand seven hundred seventy-three dead, five hundred sixty-three thousand  eighty-two wounded, and thirty-one thousand one hundred ninety-one missing in action. The  Luftwaffe: thirty-two hundred thirty-one dead, eighty-four hundred fifty-three wounded, and  two thousand twenty-eight missing in action. The Navy: three hundred ten dead, two hundred  thirty-two wounded, and a hundred fifteen missing in action.  Therefore, the Wehrmacht together had one hundred sixty-two thousand three hundred  fourteen dead, five hundred seventy-one thousand seven hundred sixty-seven wounded, and  thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-four missing in action. That is a little more than  twice the number of dead and wounded in the battle of the Somme in the World War, and a  little less than half the number of missing at the time, and yet they are the fathers and sons of  our German Volk. And now let me make my case before the outside world, which is  represented by a man who, while other nations and soldiers are fighting in the snow and ice,  tactfully chats by the fireside and therefore, is the principal in this war. When, in the year  1939, the situation of the nationalities in the former Polish state seemed to become  increasingly unbearable, I first attempted to eliminate the intolerable circumstances by means  of a fair settlement. For some time, it appeared as though the Polish government itself was  seriously considering accepting a reasonable solution. I may add here that all these proposals  contained no demands by Germany for anything that had not formerly been in Germany’s  possession. On the contrary, we renounced many things that had belonged to Germany before  the World War.  You will remember the dramatic events of this time: the persistently increasing  sacrifices by the German ethnic group. My Deputies, you are in the best position to judge the  severity of this sacrifice of blood by comparing it to the sacrifices of the present war. For the  campaign in the east up to now has cost the entire German Wehrmacht about a hundred sixty  thousand dead, while, in the midst of peace, over sixty-two thousand ethnic Germans were  killed within a few months at the time, some of them killed after the cruelest tortures. That the  German Reich had the right to complain about this state of affairs at its border and to urge its  elimination, and, in general, to attend to its security, can hardly be denied at a time when other  countries seek elements of their security even on foreign continents. The problems that were  to be corrected were insignificant in terms of territory. Essentially, it was a question of Danzig  and connecting the severed province East Prussia to the rest of the Reich. By contrast, the  cruel persecution of the Germans especially in Poland weighed heavier. The other minorities  there also endured a no less terrible fate.  As the attitude of Poland became ever more stubborn during the days of August, thanks  to the carte blanche provided by the English guarantee, the German Reich government felt  compelled, for the last time, to make proposals, based on which it was willing to enter into  negotiations with Poland and of which it orally informed the English ambassador at the time.  Allow me to retrieve these proposals from oblivion today and to remind you of them.  Meanwhile, insight into the papers at the foreign office in Warsaw later provided all of  us with a surprising explanation: A man with devilish recklessness employed his entire  influence in order to strengthen Poland in its resistance and to eliminate any possibility of an  understanding.  The reports that the Polish envoy in Washington at the time, Count Potocki, sent his  government in Warsaw are documents that make frightfully clear how much a single man and  the forces driving him bear responsibility for the Second World War.  The question poses itself, for what reason was this man so fanatically hostile toward a  country that up to now has never in its history harmed either America or this man? Insofar as  this regards Germany’s attitude to America, the following can be said:  1. Germany is perhaps the only great power that has never possessed colonies on the  north and south American continents or has become politically active there in any other  respect, with the exception of the emigration of millions of Germans and their work, from  which the American continent, especially the United States, has only benefited.  2. The German Reich has never in the entire history of the development and existence of  the United States assumed a politically adverse or even hostile attitude to it. On the contrary,  through the blood of many of its sons, it has helped to defend the United States.  3. The German Reich has never participated in a war against the United States while, in  the year 1917, it was invaded by the United States for reasons that have been revealed  completely by a committee that the current President Roosevelt had himself formed in order  to examine this question.  It was this investigative committee for the examination of the reasons behind the  American entry into the war that clearly stated that the American entry into the war in 1917  was due to the capitalist interests of a few small groups, and that Germany had no intention of  coming into conflict with America.  Beyond this, there is likewise no antagonism between the German and the American  people, either territorial or political in nature, that could somehow interfere with the interests  or the existence of the United States. There has always been a difference in the form of  government. However, this cannot be regarded as the cause of animosity in the life of nations,  as long as one form of government does not try, outside its natural sphere, to intervene in  others.  America is a republic led by a president with great authoritarian powers.  Germany was once a monarchy with limited authority, later a democracy without any  authority at all, and today it is a republic with great authority.  There is an ocean between the two states. The differences between capitalist America  and Bolshevik Russia, if there is any truth to these terms at all, must be considerably greater  than the differences between an America led by a president and a Germany led by a Fuhrer.  However, it is a fact that the two historic conflicts between Germany and the United States,  while inspired by the same force, were fanned by two men in the United States of America,  namely, President Wilson and President Franklin Roosevelt. History itself passed a verdict on  Wilson. His name remains tied to the vilest breach of promise of all time. The consequences  of this breach of promise disrupted the life not only of the vanquished, but also of the victors.  The Diktat of Versailles, which was made possible only by this breach of promise, tore states  apart, destroyed cultures, and ruined the economy.  Today, we know that an association of interested financiers stood behind Wilson. They  used the paralytic professor in order to lead America into a war which they hoped would be  good business for them. The German Volk had to pay for that with the collapse of its political  and economic life.  For what reason is it that, after these bitter experiences, another president of the United  States sees as his only mission allowing wars to develop and, above all, increasing the  animosity against Germany to the point of war breaking out? National Socialism came to  power in Germany in the same year in which Roosevelt was elected president of the United  States. It is now important to examine those elements that have to be regarded as the cause of  the present development. First, the personal aspects: I understand only too well that the  philosophy of life and the attitude of President Roosevelt and my own are worlds apart.  Roosevelt comes from a family rolling in money. From the start, he belonged to that  class of men for whom birth and descent pave the way and secure success in life in the  democracies.  I myself was the child of a small poor family. With unspeakable effort, I had to make  my way through work and diligence.  When the World War came, Roosevelt experienced it from where he was in the shadow  of Wilson, from the point of view of the profiteer. Therefore, he only knows the pleasant  consequences of the confrontation of people and states, reserved for the man who makes deals  where others bleed to death.  During this time, I lived my own life on the other, completely opposite, side. I did not  belong to the men who make history or deals. I belonged to those who followed orders.  As a common soldier, I labored to do my duty in front of the enemy during these four  years. I returned from the war just as poor as I had left for it in the autumn of 1914. I shared  the fate of millions of others. Mr. Roosevelt shared the fate of the so-called upper ten  thousand. While, after the war, Mr. Roosevelt tried his hand at financial speculations in order  to benefit personally from the inflation, that is, the diligence of others, I was still lying in the  military hospital like hundreds of thousands of other men.  And while Mr. Roosevelt finally set out to pursue the career of a normal politician, who  is experienced in business, has economic backing, and is protected by his birth, I fought as a  nameless and unknown man for the resurrection of my Volk, a people which had just suffered  the greatest injustice in its history.  The course of the two lives! When Franklin Roosevelt became the head of the United  States, he was the candidate of a thoroughly capitalist party, which used him. When I became  the chancellor of the German Reich, I was the Fuhrer of a popular movement which I myself  had created.  The forces that drove Mr. Roosevelt were forces that I fought, for the fate of my Volk  and my sacred inner beliefs. The “brain trust” that the new American president had to rely on  consisted of members of the same people that we once fought in Germany as a parasitic  phenomenon of mankind, and which we had begun to remove from public life.  But still we had something in common: Franklin Roosevelt took over a state with an  economy dilapidated due to democratic influences, and I headed a Reich likewise facing  complete ruin thanks to democracy.  The United States had thirteen million unemployed, while Germany had seven million,  along with another seven million part-time workers. In both states, public finances were in  ruins and the decline of economic life in general appeared inevitable.  At this moment, a development set in in the United States and in the German Reich that  will make it easy for posterity to pass a final judgment on the correctness of the theories.  While the German Reich, under its National Socialist leadership, experienced an enormous  improvement of life within a few years, as regards the economy, culture, art, and so on,  President Roosevelt did not manage to bring about even the smallest improvements in his own  country.  However, how much easier must this work have been in the United States, where barely  fifteen persons live on one square kilometer compared to the one hundred forty in Germany.  If it was not possible to bring about a flourishing of the economy in this country, then this was  either due to the lack of will on the part of the ruling leadership or the total incompetence of  the responsible persons.  Within barely five years, the economic problems in Germany were solved and  unemployment eliminated. During this time, President Roosevelt increased the national debt  of his country to enormous proportions, devalued the dollar, continued to ruin the economy,  and maintained unemployment.  That was not surprising, if you consider that the spirits which this man had called on to  support him, or rather who had called on him, belonged to those elements which, as Jews,  always have an interest in ruin and never in order.  While we fought speculation in National Socialist Germany, it experienced an  astounding boom during the Roosevelt era. The New Deal legislation of this man was wrong.  Therefore, it was the greatest setback that a single man ever suffered. There is no doubt that,  in peacetime, a continuation of this economic policy would have meant the fall of this  president sooner or later, in spite of his dialectical talents.  In European states, he would surely have met his end before the supreme court, because  of the willful waste of national wealth. In front of a civil court, he would hardly have escaped  being found guilty of bad business practices and he would have ended up in jail.  Many distinguished Americans agree with this assessment or, rather, realization. A  threatening opposition hangs over the head of this man. It made him realize that only a  diversion of the public’s attention from domestic to foreign policy could save him. In this  respect, it is interesting to study the reports from Washington by the Polish Envoy Potocki.  He points out time and again that Roosevelt was quite aware of the danger of a collapse of his  entire economic house of cards and that, in any event, he therefore needed a foreign policy  diversion.  He was reinforced in this by the circle of Jews surrounding him, steeped in the greed of  the Old Testament, who saw the United States as an instrument for preparing a second Purim  for the increasingly anti-Semitic European nations. It was the sheer, satanic malice of the  Jews who gathered about this man but for whom this man also reached out. And so the  influence of the president increasingly became felt in the creation of new conflicts and in the  deepening of existing conflicts, and, in any case, in the prevention of the peaceful resolution  of conflicts. For many years, this man has had only one wish: that a dispute might arise  somewhere in the world-in Europe, if possible-which would allow him to bring about an  intertwinement of political interests, based on the obligations of the American economy to  one of the disputants, and which would be suited to drawing America slowly into such a  conflict. In this way, he might be able to divert attention from his confused economic policy  at home to events abroad.  This made his procedure against the German Reich become especially brusque. From  the year 1937 on, there has been a series of speeches-among them an especially vile one in  Chicago on October 5, 1937-in which, according to plan, this man began to agitate the  American public against Germany. He threatened the establishment of a type of quarantine  against the so-called authoritarian states.  In the course of this continuously augmented campaign of hatred and agitation by  President Roosevelt, he recalled the American ambassador in Berlin to Washington, following  renewed insulting declarations. Ever since, both states have been represented only by a charge  d’affaires. From November 1938 on, he consciously began to sabotage, according to plan, all  possibilities for a policy of European pacification. Externally, he hypocritically pretended to  have an interest in peace, while threatening every state ready to pursue a policy of peaceful  settlement with the freezing of loans, other economic acts of retaliation, the cancelation of  credits, and so on. Here the reports of the Polish ambassadors in Washington, London, Paris,  and Brussels give shocking insights.  In January 1939, this man began to reinforce his campaign of hatred. In front of  Congress, he threatened to take all steps short of war against the authoritarian states.  While he always maintains that other states are seeking to interfere in American affairs  and insists on adherence to the Monroe Doctrine, he began, from March 1939 on, meddling in  intra-European affairs, which are none of the business of the president of the United States.  First, he does not understand these problems. Second, even if he understood them and the  historical course of events, he would likewise have no right to concern himself with the  Central European area, just as the German head of state has no right to judge the situation in a  state of the United States of America or to comment on it.  Yes, Mr. Roosevelt went further still. Contrary to all the provisions of international law,  he declared that he would not recognize governments that were not to his liking, that he would  not accept any new order, would not dismiss missions from long-dissolved states, which he  instead put in place as legal regimes. Finally, he went so far as to conclude treaties with such  envoys, which gave him the right to occupy foreign territories.  This was followed, on April 15, 1939, by Roosevelt’s famous appeal to me and the  Duce. It represented a mixture of political and geographic ignorance on the one hand, coupled  with the arrogance of a member of certain circles of millionaires on the other. It demanded  that we give declarations and conclude treaties of nonaggression with any named states, to a  great extent states that were not free, because the allies of Mr. Roosevelt had either annexed  them or transformed them into protectorates. You remember, my Deputies, that I gave this  impertinent gentleman a response that was as polite as it was definite, and which stopped the  torrent of words from this worthy warmonger for a few months at least.  He was replaced by his dear wife. She did not want to live with her sons in a world like  the one we have today. Understandably so, because this is a world of work, and not a world of  fraud and manipulation. After a short convalescence, the husband of this woman got an  amendment of the law on neutrality passed on November 4, 1939, which lifted the ban on  weapon export and led to a unilateral supply of arms to Germany’s enemies.  As in East Asia with China, he then began by means of an economic net to establish a  community of interests which would become effective sooner or later. In the same month, he  recognized a bunch of Polish emigrants as the socalled government-in-exile, whose political  foundation consisted in a few million Polish gold coins that they had brought from Warsaw.  On April 9, the story continues. He ordered the freezing of Norwegian and Danish funds,  under the mendacious pretext of preventing German access to them, although he knew that,  for example, Germany does not pay attention to the Danish government’s administration of  property, not to mention control it.  In addition to the various governments-in-exile, the Norwegian one received  recognition, too. As early as May 15, 1940, the Dutch and the Belgian emigre governments  were added to this. Likewise, Dutch and Belgian funds were frozen. The true sentiments of  this man were revealed in a telegram to the French Premier Reynaud on June 15. He informed  him that the American government would double its assistance to France, provided that  France continued the war against Germany. In order to emphasize this desire for a  prolongation of the war, he declared that the American government would not recognize the  results of the conquest, that is, the reclaiming of the areas Germany was once robbed of.  I need not assure you that it does not matter to any German government whether the  President of the United States recognizes a border in Europe or not, and that it will not matter  in the future either.  I cite this case only to make clear the nature of this man’s planned campaign to simulate  peace while eternally agitating for war. Because now he begins to fear that, if peace is  achieved in Europe, the millions wasted on his armament will shortly be recognized as pure  fraud, for nobody will attack America unless the Americans provoke the attack! On June 17,  1940, the president of the United States decreed French funds frozen in order, as he put it, to  prevent German access to them. In fact, with the help of an American cruiser, the gold was  removed from Casablanca to America.  From July 1940 on, Roosevelt’s measures increasingly aimed for war, ranging from  American citizens joining the Royal Air Force to English crews being trained in the United  States. And, in August 1940, the United States and Canada established a military program  together. In order to make the formation of an American-Canadian committee for defense  appear plausible to even the biggest blockheads, he invented a crisis from time to time. Then,  he acted as though America were threatened by an attack. And he got his followers-they are  truly pitiful-to believe this by interrupting his travels and rushing back to Washington in order  to underline the gravity of the situation.  In September 1940, he drew still closer to war. He transferred fifty destroyers from the  American fleet to the English fleet, in return for which, however, he took over military bases  in the British possessions in northern and central America. Only posterity will be able to  determine one thing clearly: whether he, along with all this hatred against socialist Germany,  intended to take over the British empire in its hour of disintegration as safely and with as few  risks as possible? Now that England was no longer able to pay cash for American deliveries,  he forced the Lend-Lease Act on the American people. As the president, he now had the  power to lend and lease in support of those countries whose defense appeared to himRoosevelt-to be vital to the defense of America. Again in March 1940, since Germany could  not be moved under any circumstances to react to his persistent insults, he went yet a step  further.  As early as December 19, 1939, American cruisers inside the security zone drove the  German steamer Columbus into the hands of British warships.  Because of this, it had to be scuttled. On the same day, United States forces played a  part in the attempt to capture the German steamer Arauca. On January 27, 1940, the United  States cruiser Trenton informed enemy naval forces, in violation of international law, of the  movements of the German merchant steamers Arauca, La Plata, and Wangoni. On June 27,  1940, again in complete violation of international law, he ordered a restriction of the freedom  of movement of foreign merchant ships in American ports.  In November 1940, he had the German steamers Phrygia, Darwald, and Rhein pursued  by United States warships until these steamers were scuttled to avoid falling into the enemy’s  hands. On April 13, 1941, the opening of the Red Sea to traffic followed, which enabled  United States ships to supply British armies in the Near East. In the meantime, American  public authorities had confiscated German ships in the month of March. Citizens of the  German Reich were treated in a disgraceful manner and, in violation of international law,  certain places of residence were assigned to them, travel restrictions imposed on them, and so  on.  Likewise in violation of all stipulations of international law, two German officers who  had escaped Canadian captivity were arrested and extradited to Canada. On March 27, the  same president, who is opposed to all aggression, welcomed that clique of putschists under  Simovich and his comrades who usurped power through aggression in Belgrade by  overthrowing the legitimate government. Many months before, this President Roosevelt had  sent Colonel Donovan, a completely inferior individual, to the Balkans to attempt on his  behalf to bring about a rebellion in Sofia and Belgrade directed against Germany and Italy.  In April, he promised assistance based on the Lend-Lease Act to Yugoslavia and  Greece. In late April, this man recognized Yugoslav and Greek emigrants as governments-inexile and, again in violation of international law, he froze Yugoslav and Greek funds. From  mid-April on, surveillance of the western Atlantic was extended to include United States  patrols and reports to the English.  On April 26, Roosevelt delivered twenty motor torpedo-boats and, at the same time,  repair work on British warships continued in United States ports.  On May 12, in violation of international law, Norwegian steamers, sailing under English  flag, were armed and repaired. On June 4, American troop carriers arrived in Greenland for  the construction of airfields. On June 9, there was a first English report that, on the orders of  President Roosevelt, a United States warship had fired depth charges at a German U-boat off  Greenland.  On June 14, again in violation of international law, German funds in the United States  were frozen. On June 17, under mendacious pretexts, President Roosevelt demanded the recall  of German consuls and the closing of German consulates. He further demanded the shutting  down of the German press agency Transocean, the German library of information, and the  German Reichsbahn center. From July 6 to 7, on the orders of Roosevelt, American forces  occupied Iceland, which lay inside the German combat zone. Thereby, he hoped for certain  results: 1. to force war on Germany, 2. to render German submarine warfare as useless as it  had been in the years 1915-1916.  At the same time, he sent an American promise of assistance to the Soviet Union. On  July 10, Secretary of the Navy Knox suddenly announced that the United States had orders to  fire on the Axis powers. On September 4, based on this order and together with English  planes, the United States destroyer Greer operated against German submarines in the Atlantic.  Five days later, a German submarine noticed United States destroyers serving as escort  vessels in an English convoy. On September 11, Roosevelt finally delivered the speech in  which he confirmed and reissued the order to fire on ships of the Axis. On September 29, the  United States Coast Guard attacked a German U-boat east of Greenland with depth charges.  On October 17, the United States destroyer Kearny, in convoy for England, again attacked a  German submarine with depth charges. Finally on November 6, in violation of international  law, United States forces captured the German steamer Odenwald, towed it into an American  harbor, and arrested the crew.  I shall pass over as trivial the insulting attacks and affronts by this so-called president  against my person. That he calls me a gangster is of all the less consequence, as this term did  not originate in Europe, perhaps because it lacks appropriate subjects here, but instead  originated in the United States of America.  Apart from this, I cannot be insulted by Mr. Roosevelt, because I think that he is  mentally ill, just as I thought Woodrow Wilson once was. We are aware that this man and his  Jewish following fight Japan by the same means. I do not need to discuss them here. Here,  too, the same methods were employed. First, this man agitates for war, then falsifies the  causes, makes arbitrary declarations, later disgustingly hides behind a cloud of Christian  hypocrisy. Slowly but surely, he leads mankind toward war. As an old Freemason, he cannot  do so without calling God as a witness for the integrity of his actions.  I think that all of you felt relieved that now finally one state has protested, as the first,  against this historically unique and brazen abuse of truth and law.  This man asked for it and, therefore, he should not be surprised by it. It fills all of us-the  German Volk and, I think, all decent people of the world-with profound satisfaction that the  Japanese government, after negotiating with this falsifier for years, has finally had enough of  being derided in so dishonorable a manner.  We know what force stands behind Roosevelt. It is the eternal Jew. He thinks that the  time has come to force on us something that made us shudder in the Soviet Union. We know  the Jewish paradise on earth. Millions of German soldiers gained personal insights into a  country where this international Jew has destroyed man and property. Perhaps, the president  of the United States himself has failed to understand this. This speaks for his mental  limitations.  But we know what the goal of his struggle is: even if we were not allied to Japan, we  would realize that it is the intention of the Jews and their Franklin Roosevelt to destroy one  state after another. Today’s German Reich has, however, nothing in common with the former  Germany. For our part, we shall now do what this troublemaker has tried to get us to do for  years. Not only because we are Japan’s ally, but also because the present leaders of Germany  and Italy understand that, in this historic time, the existence or nonexistence of nations is  being determined, perhaps forever. It is clear to us what this other world plans to do with us.  They made the former democratic Germany starve, and they would exterminate the National  Socialist Germany of today.  If Mr. Churchill or Mr. Roosevelt now declare that they wish to establish a new social  order later, then this is tantamount to a bald hairdresser recommending his unfailing hair  restorer. These gentlemen, who live in socially retarded states, should have taken care of their  unemployed instead of agitating for war. There is enough need and misery in their countries  to keep them occupied with the distribution of foodstuffs. As far as the German Volk is  concerned, it does not want handouts from Mr. Churchill or Mr. Roosevelt- it wants its rights.  And it will secure these rights to life, even if a thousand Churchills conspire against it. This  Volk has a history of nearly two thousand years. Thanks to the National Socialist movement,  it has never been as united and unified as it is today and as it will be in the future. Perhaps  never before has it been so clear-sighted and rarely so aware of its honor.  I have therefore had passports sent to the American Charge d’ Affaires and had the  following announced to him: In the pursuit of the continuous expansion of the policy by  President Roosevelt to establish a dictatorship of unlimited world rule, the United States of  America, together with England, has not shied away from employing every means to dispute  the foundations for the natural preservation of the German, the Italian, and the Japanese  people’s life. Because of this, the governments of England and of the United States of  America have opposed any justified revision to bring about a better new world order, not only  for the present but also for the future.  Since the beginning of the war, the American President Roosevelt has committed more  and more crimes against international law. Lawless attacks on ships and other property of  German and Italian citizens have been accompanied by threats to-yes, and even arbitrary  deprivation of-their personal liberty by means of internment, and so on. The attacks by  President Roosevelt of the United States have escalated in other respects as well and have led  him to order the navy, contrary to the rules of international law, to attack immediately ships of  German and Italian nationality, to fire on them, and to sink them. American cabinet  secretaries have participated in this in a criminal manner by destroying German U-boats  through their campaigns of agitation. German and Italian merchant ships have been attacked  by American cruisers, captured, and their peaceable crews imprisoned. Furthermore, without  any effort by the American government to deny it publicly, a plan by President Roosevelt was  published in America, indicating that he wanted to attack Germany and Italy in Europe by  military means, at the latest in the year 1943.  Because of this, Germany and Italy’s sincere and patient efforts to prevent an expansion  of the war and to maintain relations with the United States in spite of the unbearable  provocations by President Roosevelt over the years have been frustrated.  In response to this, Germany and Italy have finally felt obliged to fight together, side by  side with Japan, against the United States and England, true to the stipulations of the  Tripartite Pact of September 27, 1940, in the struggle for the defense-and thereby the  preservation of the freedom and independence- of their people and empires. The three powers  have therefore concluded the following agreement, which was signed today in Berlin: In the  unshakable determination not to lay down their arms until the common war against the United  States of America and England has been brought to a victorious end, the German, the Italian,  and the Japanese governments have agreed on the following: Article I Germany, Italy, and  Japan will together fight this war, a war that was forced on them by the United States of  America and England, and bring it to a victorious end by deploying all instruments of power  at their disposal.  Article II Germany, Italy, and Japan pledge themselves not to conclude a separate  armistice or peace with the United States of America and England without obtaining full  mutual consent.  Article III Germany, Italy, and Japan will continue to cooperate closely, even after the  victorious conclusion of the war, as a sign of bringing about a just new order in the spirit of  the Tripartite Pact concluded on September 27, 1940.  Article IV This agreement comes into force upon signature. It will remain in force for  the term of the Tripartite Pact of September 27, 1940. The high contracting parties shall reach  an understanding on the nature of the cooperation provided for in Article III of this agreement  in a timely fashion prior to the expiration of this term.  Deputies! Men of the German Reichstag! Ever since the rejection of my last peace  proposal in July 1940, we have been aware that this war has to be fought to the bitter end.  That the Anglo- American, Jewish-capitalist world formed a front with Bolshevism does not  come as a surprise to us National Socialists. At home, we found them in the same union, and  we succeeded in our struggle at home by defeating our enemies after a sixteen-year-long  struggle for power.  When I decided twenty-three years ago to enter politics in order to reverse the decline of  the nation, I was a nameless, unknown soldier. Many of you know how difficult the first years  of this struggle were. The way from a small movement of seven men to the taking over of  responsible government on January 30, 1933, was so miraculous that Providence itself must  have made it possible through its blessings.  Today, I head the strongest army in the world, the mightiest air force, and a proud navy.  Behind me, I am conscious of the sworn community of the party, which made me great and  which became great through me.  The enemies that I confront have been known to be our enemies for over twenty years.  Alas, the road that lies ahead of me cannot be compared to the one lying behind me. The  German Volk realizes the decisiveness of the hour for its existence. Under the most difficult  circumstances, millions of soldiers are obediently and loyally doing their duty.  Peasants, workers, German women and girls work by the sweat of their brows in the  factories and offices, in the fields and in farmland, to secure bread for the homeland and  weapons for the front. The strong people allied to us suffer the same misery and face the same  enemies.  The American President and his plutocratic clique have called us a people of have-nots.  That is right! And these have-nots want to live. In any event, they will not allow the owners to  rob them of the little that they have to live on. My party comrades, you know my relentless  resolve to conclude a struggle victoriously once it has begun. You know my intention not to  shy away from anything in such a fight and to break all the resistance that has to be broken.  In my speech on September 1, 1939, I assured you that, in this struggle, neither the force  of arms nor time will defeat Germany. I want to assure my enemies that neither will the force  of arms nor time defeat us, but neither inner doubts make us falter in the fulfillment of our  duty. When we consider the sacrifices of our soldiers, how they risk their lives, then the  sacrifices of the homeland become completely insignificant and unimportant. When we think  of the numbers of those who, generations before us, fell for the existence and greatness of the  German Volk, then we become all the more aware of the greatness of the duty imposed on us.  Whoever seeks to forsake this duty has no right to expect treatment as a Volksgenosse  in our midst.  Just as we were mercilessly harsh in our struggle for power, we will be merciless and  harsh in our struggle for the preservation of our Volk. Thousands of our best men will fall in  its course, the fathers and the sons of our Volk.  Therefore, no one can expect to live who thinks that he can depreciate the front’s  sacrifices at home. Irrespective of the form of disguise for this attempt to disrupt this German  front, to undermine this Volk’s willingness to resist, to weaken the authority of this regime, to  sabotage the efforts of the homeland, the offender will fall! There will be only one difference:  the soldier honorably makes this sacrifice at the front, while the other, who wishes to  depreciate this honorable sacrifice, dies in shame.  Our enemies should not deceive themselves. In the two thousand years of the history  known to us, our German Volk has never been more unified and united than it is today. The  Lord of the Worlds has done so many great things for us in the last years that we bow in  gratitude before Providence, which has permitted us to be members of such a great Volk. We  thank Him that, in view of past and future generations of the German Volk, we were also  allowed to enter our names honorably in the undying book of German history. \"\n",

            "        \"transcript\": \"It was one year ago that I last spoke to you and the German Volk from this place. In  many respects, this is regrettable. First, because I very much regret not being able to  step before the nation more often and, second, because I fear that my speeches are  not getting better but worse-because this also needs practice.  Regrettably, my time is far more limited than that of my opponents. Someone who can  travel around the world for weeks, in a white silk shirt, a wide sombrero on his head, can also  attend to speeches more often. During this time, I have had to concern myself more with  actions and deeds. Besides, even otherwise, I cannot speak every week or every month, of  course. What must be said today will be said by our soldiers! The topics on which I could  speak are of course more difficult than my enemies’ discourses, who sent their chats out to the  world-at least in former times-more often from the fireside than anywhere else. I do not think  it appropriate, for example, to concern myself with the design of what will be one day.  Instead, I think it is more appropriate for us all to concern ourselves with what the present  demands of us.  To concoct an “Atlantic Charter” is naturally quite simple. This stupidity will soon be  rectified by hard facts. There is yet another reason why it is easier for our enemies to speak  today: after long and futile efforts, they have suddenly discovered our party program. With  astonishment, we see how they promise the world the same things we have already given our  German Volk and for which we were in the end attacked by others.  It is also quite clever when, for example, a president says, “we want everyone to have  the right in the future not to suffer misery,” or something of the sort. Here you can only say: it  would perhaps have been easier had the president used the entire capacity for work of his  country to build up useful production instead of jumping headlong into a war, and had he  above all taken care that need and misery would be eliminated among his own people, who  live in an area with only ten persons per square kilometer but have thirteen million  unemployed. All this the gentlemen could well have done! Now, they suddenly make an  appearance, portraying themselves to the world as saviors, and declaring, “we shall take care  in the future that the need of the past does not return, that there will be no more  unemployment, and that everyone gets an apartment.”-But these owners of empires could  have done this long before us in their own countries! They are now suddenly discovering the  principles of the National Socialist program. When I hear a man say-I think it was Mr. Eden,  but it is hard to tell which zero is speaking over there-“the difference between the Germans  and us is that the Germans believe something in which they do not believe, and that we  believe something in which we do believe,” then I can only say, if they really believe what  they pretend to believe in, then they could have acknowledged this belief much earlier. Why  then did they declare war on us when they are after all not that far away from us? We did not  merely believe something, we also did what we believed in. And now we believe that we have  to fight the enemy until the final victory. This we believe and this we will do! It is impossible  for us to debate with these people about the term “belief.” Who believes, for example, that  Namsos was a victory, or Andalsnes, or who believes that Dunkirk was the greatest victory in  world history or, for all I care, that some expedition lasting nine hours was an equally  astonishing and encouraging sign of a victorious nation-with something like this, of course,  we naturally cannot compare our modest successes! What are our successes by comparison! If  we advance a thousand kilometers, then that is nothing but a “complete failure.” For example,  when we advance to the Don during the last few months-after all, it has been only a few  months that war has been waged in this country-and when we move down the Don and reach  the Volga, when we rush on Stalingrad and will take it-you can be assured of that!-then this  amounts to nothing in their eyes! When we advance to the Caucasus, that amounts to nothing,  just as when we occupy the Ukraine, take possession of the Donets coals, gain sixty-five to  seventy percent of Russian iron, open up the greatest breadbasket in the world to the German  Volk and Europe, and secure for ourselves the oil wells in the Caucasus. All that amounts to  nothing! However, when Canadian advance parties with a small English tail in tow reach  Dieppe and at great effort manage to hold the position for nine hours before they are finally  destroyed, then that is an “encouraging, astonishing sign of the untiring victorious power that  characterizes the British Empire.” By comparison, what is our Luftwaffe, our infantry, our  panzer weapons? In the year 1939, they were nothing. At the time, Churchill had already  appeared and said, “I am happy to inform you that the danger posed by the Uboats can be  regarded as having been eliminated for good.” No-wait a minute-perhaps that was not  Churchill, but Duff Cooper; one of these swaggerers (Schwadroneure) is always bigger than  the other, and you constantly mistake one for the other. At the time, they had already  destroyed more Uboats than we owned! That we kicked them out of the Balkans, that we  conquered Greece, that we occupied Crete, that we drove them back in North Africa-that  amounted to nothing. However, if a few men land somewhere to take a lonely outpost of ours  by surprise, then that is a deed, that is an accomplishment.  He who believes this will never understand our belief. Should the English seriously  believe what they pretend to believe, then you can only worry about their senses.  In addition to these “deeds,” they also have vouchers for the future, naturally. They say,  “A second front will come. It is already advancing. You Germans, pay attention! Aboutface!” We did not pay attention and did not about-face. Instead, we calmly marched on. I am  not saying that we are not preparing for a second front. Mr. Churchill now says, “We will  leave it to the Germans to brood over in their fright where and when we will open it.” I can  only say, Mr. Churchill, you have never frightened me! But you are right in that we do have to  brood over something. If I had an enemy of stature, then I could figure out where he would  attack. However, if you are confronted by military silly boys (Kindskopfe), then you can never  know where they will attack, since it could be the craziest undertaking. And what is so  unpleasant is that you never know with these lunatics and constant drunks what they will do  next.  Whether or not Mr. Churchill has chosen the first location where he wants to start the  second front appropriately and in a militarily clever way, opinions on this are divided even in  England-and that is saying a lot. I can assure him: no matter which place he chooses next, he  can consider himself fortunate if he stays on land for nine hours! In my eyes, we have already  passed the most fateful test for our Volk in the year 1942. It was the winter of 1941–1942. I  may say that Providence weighed on the German Volk and especially its Wehrmacht in this  winter. Worse cannot and will not come. That we conquered this winter, that the German  fronts stood up, and that we could again line up in the early spring, this proved, so I believe,  that Providence was satisfied with the German Volk. It was a very difficult and a very hard  test-all of us know this. Nevertheless, we did not only survive this difficult time, but we also  calmly managed to order and rearrange the divisions for the attack, as well as the motorized  and panzer units which were earmarked to begin the next offensive. And this offensive has  also developed differently from what our enemies had envisioned. After all, it is not necessary  that we proceed in accordance with their method, since these methods have proved so  unsuccessful.  I believe that, in looking back, we can be content with the past three years.  The objective was always very sober; bold where it had to be bold, prudent where it  could be prudent; unhurried where we had time, cautious where we believed that we had to be  cautious under all circumstances. However, we were being daring where daring alone could  help.  For this year, we have drawn up a very simple program. First: under all circumstances,  to hold what must be held. That means that we will let the others get underway as long as they  want to get underway where we do not intend to advance. To hold firm and to wait and see  who will be the first to tire.  Second: It’s absolutely imperative to attack where an attack is necessary under all  circumstances. The objective is clear: the destruction of the right arm of this international  conspiracy of capitalism, plutocracy, and Bolshevism, which is the greatest danger that has  ever hovered above our German Volk and against which we have been in battle for a year  now.  We have set ourselves several objectives here. I will briefly summarize in catchwords  what has been accomplished in these few months in order to make you aware of it: The first  objective was the securing of our superior position at the Black Sea and the final clearing of  the Crimean Peninsula. Two battles served this purpose: that of Kerch and that of Sevastopol.  Let me say that had our enemies had at least one success in these three years of war, then it  would surely be impossible to speak with them at all, since they would no longer float here on  earth, but in the clouds, bloated by conceit. After we had set things in order there, it appeared  necessary to us to eliminate the bulge that had developed at Volkhov. It was cut off, and the  enemy destroyed or captured. Then came the next task: preparing the breakthrough to the  Don. In the meantime, the enemy chose a great offensive objective, namely, to break through  to the banks of the Dnieper from Kharkov in order to bring about the collapse of our entire  southern front. Perhaps you recall our enemies’ enthusiasm in following these operations. It  ended in three battles and the complete destruction of more than seventy-five divisions of our  Soviet enemy.  Thereupon, we lined up for our own great offensive. The first goal was to take from the  enemy the last great breadbasket; second, to pull out from under him the last bit of coal that  can be carbonized; third, to move up to his oil fields, either to take them or at least to shut him  out of there; fourth, the attack was to be continued in order to cut off his last great arterial  road, the Volga.  The objective was an area between the bend of the Don and the Volga, and the town of  Stalingrad-not because the town bears Stalin’s name, which is unimportant-but exclusively  because it is a strategically important area, and we were aware that the elimination of the  Dnieper, the Don, and the Volga as traffic routes would be as terrible or worse for the Soviet  Union, as it would be for Germany if we lost the Rhine, the Elbe, the Oder, or the Danube. On  the mighty Volga stream alone, thirty million tons of goods are transported in six months.  That is just as much as in one year on the Rhine. It [the Volga] has now been cut off for some  time. Now it is the taking of Stalingrad above all that will be brought to a conclusion-whereby  this lock will gain in depth and strength.  And you can rest assured that no human being can remove us from this place! As to our  further intentions, you will understand that I will not speak about them, as it is a question of  objectives which are being pursued at this time. In my stead, Mr. Churchill speaks about  them. But the time will come when the German nation will obtain clarity on these further  goals.  I can tell you, however, that the next task that we will set for ourselves will naturally be  the organization of this gigantic area which we are now occupying.  We were not as interested in marching so many thousands of kilometers as we were in  placing this gigantic area in the service of feeding our Volk, securing our raw materials, and,  in a wider sense, sustaining all of Europe.  To this end, traffic had to be put in order. The English, too, have achievements in this  area. For example, they built a railroad from Egypt to Tobruk, from which we greatly benefit  right now. Even if they managed to finish pretty much on time, what is this compared with the  railroads that we must build for our use and not that of the Russians? There are ten thousands  and again ten thousands of kilometers of railroads that we either will repair or which we have  already repaired a long time ago, thanks to the diligence, hard work, and dedication of many  ten thousands of German soldiers, railroad engineers, men of the Todt organization and other  organizations, the Reich labor service and so on. The huge traffic network, which today runs  on German gauges for the most part, was completely destroyed. Not hundreds, but thousands  of bridges had to be newly built, craters or mines had to be eliminated, crossings had to be  newly set up. All this was accomplished in a few months or will be finished in a few weeks.  Now, my party comrades, you will understand one thing: when people on our enemies’  side say, “Why did they stop all of a sudden?” then I can only reply, because we are careful.  Because we do not run to Benghazi only to have to run back again, but because we stop  somewhere until our supply lines are back in order. Of course, people who lack military  schooling cannot understand this. That is why they do not have any successes. Anybody who  has a little bit of military knowledge will admit that what we conquered in terms of space in a  few months is unique in world history. I am also saying this because it is possible here, too,  that there is some old reactionary Philistine (Spiesser), who says, “Yes, what does this amount  to, they have already been standing there for eight days.” Yes, my dear Philistine, you don’t  understand.  You should go first and put traffic back in order.  I know that the German Volk in its entirety has had up to now such boundless faith in  its military leaders and in the accomplishments of its soldiers that it knows that there is  always a reason for stopping. Not only do we put traffic in order on the tracks, but we must  also build roads since the “blessed land of proletarians and peasants” regrettably does not  have any roads, but only fragments of roads. The first truly mighty roads are being built now  by our organizations there. In some areas, roads must be built through swamps that in former  times were held to be impassable. If someone says, “but the Russian managed to get through”-  well, he is a type of swamp-man (Sumpfmensch) and no European, that we must admit. For  us, it is more difficult to advance in this swamp than for this people born in a morass! Behind  this, we are also organizing agriculture. After all, the area is supposed to be developed, and  that is not easy, since it is not a question of simply sowing and harvesting. Rather, it is a  question of making use of, that is, transporting these products across vast distances to a  railroad, where they can be loaded. Finally, we must restructure part of this economy:  thousands of tractors which were either damaged or eliminated must be improved or replaced  with other means. I can only tell you: what has been accomplished here is simply incredible!  While the front is fighting, a few kilometers behind it the same soldiers work with sickle and  scythe, cultivate the fields again, and behind them the operational staffs of our agricultural  organizations move up.  And, if some blockhead (Schafskopf)-I simply cannot call them anything else- like Duff  Cooper, Eden, or some other fellow says, “Yes, it was a big mistake for the Germans to move  into the Ukraine or the Kuban region,”-we will see whether it was a mistake for us to take  these breadbaskets! Luckily, we are already able to make accessible to the German Volk the  first, modest gains from this action. Rest assured, we are only beginning. The whole of last  year was a year of fighting, a gruesome winter followed, and now we are fighting again. As  early as next year this area will be organized in a completely different manner. You can rest  assured of this, we know how to put something like that in order.  And finally, there is the organization of the economy in general. After all, the whole  economy must be put into service. Thousands of enterprises, factories, mills, and so on, must  get going again, since right now things are destroyed. Next, there is the mining industry. It  must also be developed, as well as electrical energy. I can only repeat one thing: if you could  see how we work there and what we create there; how we know that, according to plan, this  mine will be ready on this day, and how it will be hooked up to electricity in this month; and  on this day so many tons of coal will have been produced there, and so on; how we no longer  need to transport coal from Germany to the east, how we are instead building an industrial  base of our own there; then you would understand that, at a time when apparently nothing is  happening, there is nonetheless tremendous work being done.  Moreover, the population is released from the pressures of a Bolshevik power that  psychologically subjects millions of human beings there to despondency and, as one can well  say, holds them in a type of fear of which nobody has an idea here in Germany or in other  countries. It is the fear of the commissar, it is the fear of the GPU, a fear of the entire regime,  which still frightens millions of human beings. This must gradually be overcome and it will  be overcome. Today, there are already vast areas in which the entire population works with  us-millions of them-and there are other areas in which they already fight in our ranks and on  our side.  The results of this gigantic activity, which I outlined to you in only a few sentences, are  tremendous. As we are on the defensive in the north of Europe, in the west, and on all other  fronts, we are fulfilling a gigantic prerequisite for the organization of Europe in the war and  for victory.  You know, of course, that our enemies are continuously working miracles.  There is not one tank that they are building which is not “the best in the world.” No  plane of which they do not claim the same. If they build a cannon, a very simple cannon, then  it is the most amazing cannon in the world. If they make a new machine gun, then it is only  natural that it is the very best. They say that the new Sten gun is the greatest invention in the  world. If you look at this junk (Gelumpe), then you can only say that this is something which  we would never place in the hand of a German soldier.  They are far superior to us in all things. They are superior in their matchless generals;  they are superior in the valor of their individual soldiers.  Any Englishman could take on at least three Germans.  However, history will put the great heroes of this war on our side! And history will  thereby honor justice and truth.  In addition, there is on our side the further expansion of our alliances, the cooperation  with our allies, at their head our oldest ally, Italy. We fight together not only along one front,  but also along a number of fronts. And that is good because it proves that all the hopes of our  enemies, who believed that they could dissolve this alliance, were crazy. Both of us know  exactly what would become of our countries-we deduce this from crazy and stupid objectives  of our enemies-we know what the fate of the German and Italian people would be, what the  fate of Europe would be, if this outside world ever gained a victory.  If they say today, “Yes, of course, we will take on the protection of Europe against  Bolshevism,” then I can only reply that England should be careful to protect itself from  Bolshevism! We do not need its protection. We have overcome Bolshevism at home, we will  overcome it abroad, too! This we have proved! If archbishops say Mass in a country with the  Bolshevik flag on one side of their altars and the national flag on the other, then I fear for this  country. We know what this leads to. The English will live to see it. Fate will perhaps punish  them, as it once punished the former Germany, which believed it could make a pact with these  people. Germany and Italy, just like Spain and a number of other European people like the  Hungarians, Romanians, and so on, have overcome this problem.  Whether or not the outside world will also do so it remains to be seen in this war.  That this outside world will not conquer us can be assured! If we add all our allies and  those who fight on our side, Romanians, Hungarians, Croatians, Slovaks, and Finns in the  north, and Spaniards, and so on, then we can truly say: even today, this is a European crusade.  In addition, there are the Germanic volunteers in our Waffen SS and legions from individual  European states. It is truly Europe that has come together here, as in former times against  attacks by the Huns or Mongols.  Since I spoke to you last time, Japan has entered the war. Of course, it has supposedly  suffered defeat after defeat. Of course, Japanese generals amount to nothing at all compared  with the matchless heroes and famous generals from England and America. MacArthur, what  a general! What is such a little Japanese man by comparison. However, these Japanese have in  the meantime taken Hong Kong. They have taken control of Singapore, and they have taken  possession of the Philippines. They are in New Guinea and they will conquer all of New  Guinea. They have occupied Java and Sumatra. Naturally, this all amounts to nothing at all  compared with the endless victories that England and America have won there; land battles,  sea battles, the like of which the world has never seen before. Roosevelt says, “I cannot  comment on this, I cannot say anything about this and, anyway, I do not wish to say anything  concrete or expand on this.” We know these heroes only too well! There is today truly a  worldwide alliance not only of the have-nots, but also of all people who fight for honor and  decency and who are determined to make a clean sweep of the vilest coalition the world has  ever seen. On this matter, I wish to speak again of our U-boats. Their successes since 1939,  supported by the heroic deployment of our Luftwaffe units, have become greater every month.  Our enemies now declare, “We have tremendous defensive capabilities, we have new  methods, the British and the American genius has invented completely new machines with  which we will overcome this danger.” I can only tell them one thing: the German genius is not  resting either! We have far surpassed all earlier accomplishments with our U-boats! And I can  assure you that this will not change in the future. We keep on top of things; you can be  convinced of this. Not only do we continue to build weapons, but also and above all we keep  building new weapons. Until now, in any event, we have lined up every year with weapons  that were superior to those of the enemy. That is how it will be in the future, too! As we look  at the overall result, we can only say that the last months of this year have also been  successful. And it will continue to be this way.  In addition to the “second front,” there is yet another means. The man who invented  bomb warfare against an innocent civilian population declared that this bomb warfare against  Germany and so on will shortly be greatly stepped up. I would like to add one thing to this: in  May 1940, Mr. Churchill sent the first bombers against the German civilian population. At the  time, I kept warning him, for almost four months-in vain. Then, we struck. And we struck so  thoroughly that he began to cry and declared that this was barbaric and terrible, and that  England would seek revenge. The man on whose conscience all this weighs-not counting the  great warmonger Roosevelt-and who is to blame for everything, this man then dared to claim  that he was innocent.  Today, he continues to wage this war.  I would like to say here: the hour will also come this time when we have to answer!  May the two great criminals of this war and their Jewish masterminds not start whining and  weeping if the end is more terrible for England than the beginning! At the Reichstag session  of September 1, 1939, I said two things: First, since this war was forced on us, neither the  power of arms nor time will defeat us. Second, should Jewry instigate an international world  war in order to exterminate the Aryan people of Europe, then not the Aryan people will be  exterminated, but the Jews. The wire-pullers of this insane man in the White House have  managed to pull one nation after another into this war.  Correspondingly, however, a wave of anti-Semitism swept over one nation after  another. And it will continue to do so, taking hold of one state after another. Every state that  enters this war will one day emerge from it as an anti- Semitic state. The Jews once laughed  about my prophecies in Germany. I do not know whether they are still laughing today or  whether they no longer feel like laughing. Today, too, I can assure you of one thing: they will  soon not feel like laughing anymore anywhere. My prophecies will prove correct here, too.  The successes of the last months and their impact on world history are so great that it is  now necessary to think of those to whom we owe all these successes. They read in the  newspapers about great victories, great battles of encirclement. For weeks, however, they read  no more than: “the operations are progressing,” or “the operations are progressing favorably,”  or “there is calm at this or that front,” or “attacks at other fronts were repelled.” My  Volksgenossen! You have no idea what is concealed by these simple words in the reports of  the supreme Wehrmacht high command. The Wehrmacht report must remain modest. We  must try to keep a balanced view in order to render justice to the actual events in accordance  with their importance for the overall situation. This does not mean that the fight is any easier  for the individual German soldier in those instances which appear insignificant compared with  the great events, than for the soldier fighting for major decisions. It is always a human being  who risks his life.  There are often hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers from all branches of the  services-infantry, army, engineers, artillery, Waffen SS units, Luftwaffe units, naval units; our  warships above and below the water-all of them must risk their lives in such a situation for  many days only to read: “defensive battles,” or “breakthrough by the enemy thwarted,” or  “attacking enemy annihilated,” or “breakthrough achieved,” or “advances in this or that area,”  or “conquest of this or that pass,” or “taking of this or that city.” My Volksgenossen, you have  no idea what human heroism is concealed by this, what human pain and suffering, and, we  can say, what fear in many instances, what fear of death especially by those who face this trial  by ordeal for the first time. This is easy to read about, but incredibly difficult to do.  It is similar to the First World War. Then, too, many soldiers returned home and were  asked, “What is it actually like?” They then realized that you cannot explain this to someone  who has not gone through it himself. Who has not gone through this once himself does not  know and understand it, and you cannot explain it to him. And that is why some simply  remain silent and do not say anything, because they feel that they cannot describe what it was  really like, especially considering how barbaric the enemy is in the east. He is an enemy of  whom we know that he does not recruit men but beasts.  Behind all these dry descriptions, there lies endless suffering, endless devotion, endless  activity. When you read that someone has received the Knight’s Cross, then there is a short  report in the local press. However, the majority of our Volk cannot be made aware of what is  concealed in the description of his individual accomplishments. It is impossible for the  individual to know what it means when a pilot downs thirty, forty, or fifty planes or even  eighty or a hundred. This does not mean one hundred battles; he risks his life a thousand times  for this. And if he climbs to heights of, let us say, a hundred fifty, a hundred eighty, or two  hundred downings, then this is .… However, this has never yet happened. Not even in the last  war. Or, when U-boat commanders keep attacking time and again, when commanders of  small motorized torpedo boats accomplish their missions time and again, mineclearing details  carry out their orders in incessant deployment, which can be mentioned with only one line in  the Wehrmacht report-a continuous sacrifice of life over many weeks and months in contrast  to one line printed in the paper! If we keep this in mind, then we have to realize that,  considering everything the homeland does, it can never thank our soldiers enough.  And this applies not only to our soldiers but also to all the soldiers of our allied nations  who fight on our side. Something else should be mentioned here: namely, that the German  Wehrmacht does not act in its deployment as, for example, the English do. We do not send  others where it is particularly dangerous. Instead, we regard it as our conscientious duty, as  our honor, that we honestly assume our toll of blood ourselves. We have no Canadians or  Australians to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for us. Instead, we fight [side by side] with our  allies, all of them loyal and completely honorable.  We believe that this is necessary. Because only then will ultimately result from this  most difficult struggle-perhaps the most difficult in our history- what we National Socialists  envisioned when we came out of the First World War: the great Reich of a Volksgemeinschaft  bound together by suffering and by joy. For there is a great, bright aspect to this war: namely,  a great comradeship. What our party always sought to achieve in peacetime is now being  fortified: the building of a Volksgemeinschaft based on the experiences of the First World  War. All German tribes are part of this; otherwise, the foundation of the Greater German  Reich would merely have been a constitutional act. Instead, it became an eternal document  signed with the blood of all. It is a document that nobody can erase anymore and against  which our enemies’ talk and babble will remain completely ineffective. Above all, it is a  document that gives this state not only power but also inner meaning. You will notice this in  reading the proposals for the Knight’s Cross. You see the common man next to the private  first class, the noncommissioned officer next to the sergeant, the second lieutenant next to the  general. In looking at the promotion list for our young officers, you will see the beginning of  the impact by our National Socialist Volksgemeinschaft to its full extent.  There are no more privileges by birth certificate, none by former positions in life, none  by so-called origin, none by so-called education in former times.  There is only one criterion: the criterion of the brave, valiant, loyal man, the determined  fighter, the daring man who is fit to be a leader of his Volk. Truly, the collapse of an old  world has been brought about. From this war arises a blood-fortified Volksgemeinschaft, a  stronger one than that we National Socialists were able to convey to the nation after the World  War through our avowal of faith. And this will perhaps be the greatest blessing for our Volk  in the future: that we will emerge from this war improved in our community, cleansed of  many prejudices, that this war will prove all the more how correct the party program of our  movement was, how correct our whole National Socialist attitude is. For there is one thing  which is certain: no bourgeois state will survive this war.  Sooner or later, everybody has to put his cards on the table here. Only he who manages  to forge his people into a unity not only as a state but also as a society will emerge as the  victor from this war. That we National Socialists laid the foundations a long time ago, we and  I owe to our experiences in the first war. That the Greater German Reich must now fight a  second war-to this our movement will owe the reinforcement and additional depth of its  program in the future. May all those be assured of this who perhaps still believe that maybe  one day they will be able to witness the new rosy dawn of their class world through empty  talk and faultfinding. These gentlemen will pitifully suffer shipwreck. World history will push  them aside, as though they had never existed.  Returning from the Great War as a soldier, I once explained this Weltanschauung to the  German Volk and created the foundations for the party.  Do you believe that any German could offer the soldiers, who today are coming home  victorious from the war, anything less than a National Socialist Germany-in the sense of the  true fulfillment of our ideas of a true Volksgemeinschaft? That is impossible! And this will  surely be the most beneficial blessing of this war in the future.  Not only is the expansion of territory decisive, but also decisive is the filling of this  space with a united, strong Volk, which must avow as its essential principle: every soldier of  this Volk carries the marshal’s baton in his knapsack-not only in theory, but also in reality.  After this war, the way will all the more be open for every individual Volksgenosse whose  ingenuity, whose diligence, whose valor, whose fitness and willingness for deployment may  open the way for him.  At this moment, I should not like to neglect mentioning in contrast to the front, the  homeland, which has also had to suffer a lot. The German worker has slaved away. I have  witnessed this spring, when it was a question of quickly producing new defensive weapons,  that many workers not only worked ten or eleven hours, but also without Sundays off for  many weeks in the one thought of giving the front weapons and helping it. I must point out  that the German workers have done immense work and that they loyally stand behind today’s  state, their leadership, and, above all, their soldiers, their comrades, and their colleagues.  I must point out that the German rural population has also fulfilled its duty. Millions of  German women have integrated themselves into the working process. A peasant woman today  must often do the work of two men. And finally, I must point out that our professions that  work with the mind and all their institutions work self-sacrificially; millions and millions give  everything to think and work in order to arm the nation and never again to set the front an  example as in 1918.  If I can today tell the homeland that it can rest completely reassured that in the east, in  the west, in the north, in the south, the German front and our soldiers stand unshakably, then I  can also tell the front: German soldier, rest assured, behind you stands a homeland which will  never let you down.  That is not an empty phrase. Week after week, month after month, the best of our Volk  from all walks of life are increasingly forged together into an indissoluble community. And  this community will prove itself, especially in the great Hilfswerk which we have to make  succeed this winter. I have often pointed out that it would have been possible to render  assistance by some other means, but that we did not do it because of the simple realization  that it is important to acquaint the individual Volksgenossen with the tasks which move the  nation and which therefore touch every one of us. Above all, the blessed among men thereby  become concerned with the plight of those less fortunate.  Continuous propaganda shows them what still remains to be done so that we can speak  of a community in the true sense of the word, so that it is not lip service, but instead so that  every individual really contributes to the best of his abilities in rendering useful service to this  community and, above all, so that nobody has the right to excuse himself from this work,  especially not at a time when millions of others defend this community with their blood.  I direct this appeal to the entire German Volk in the name of all its soldiers and of all  those who sacrifice themselves in armament factories, the countryside, or elsewhere.  Also I should not like to neglect telling you at this hour that we will mercilessly destroy  every saboteur of this community. Only a few weeks ago, an English newspaper in an  enlightened hour correctly remarked that one ought not to laugh about the German  Winterhilfswerk. Above all, one thing is a fact: if someone in England enriches himself at the  expense of somebody else, then he will receive a sentence-provided that he is apprehended-of  perhaps a few hours of lessons, at worst a few weeks or months of jail, where he can live  better than any soldier at the front. On the other hand, anyone who sins against the community  in Germany is practically digging his own grave. This English newspaper is right: at a time  when the best of our Volk have to be deployed at the front, where they risk their lives, at such  a time there is no room for criminals and good-for-nothings who destroy the nation! Whoever  enriches himself on what was earmarked for our soldiers can count on being mercilessly  eliminated! Whoever enriches himself on what so many hands of our Volk made in sacrifice  for our soldiers should not expect to find mercy. Every German must know that what he gives  his soldiers or the suffering homeland will actually benefit those who deserve it and for whom  it was meant. Above all, no habitual offender should delude himself that a new crime will  help him survive this war. We will take care that it is not the decent man alone who may  possibly die at the front, but that the criminal and indecent man at home will certainly not  survive this time! I do not want a German woman who is on her way home from work at night  to have to constantly pay fearful attention to falling victim to some goodfor- nothing or  criminal. We will exterminate these criminals, and we have exterminated them. And it is to  this fact that the German Volk owes it that there are so few crimes happening today. I believe  that I am working on behalf of the maintenance of our community, especially on behalf of our  front, which has a right to demand that, while the soldiers are risking their lives out there,  their families, their wives, and other family members at home are protected.  At this moment I must assure the front of something else, too: namely, how immensely  bravely this German homeland accepts and suffers the war wherever it is most immediately  and harshly affected by it. I know a city, a Frisian city, which I have long wanted to evacuate  because it kept being attacked. I wished to remove the children and women from there to  bring them into security. It was out of the question; they kept returning to their city. You  could not get them to go away, although they had suffered so much there.  There are many acts of heroism being done, not only by men, but also by women, and  not only by women, but also by boys who are barely fifteen, sixteen, seventeen years old.  They risk their lives in the realization that, in this war, we are a single sworn community  which knows that either we all survive this war victoriously or we will be exterminated  together.  If the soldier did not know this, then you could not expect him to risk his life. Vice  versa, the homeland must know that it will be judged in accordance with its performance. I  therefore expect that the new Winterhilfswerk will strongly document this indissoluble  community, that the nation will show to the whole world through its vote that this is not a  phony poll, but a vote for sacrifice by declaring the following: We stand behind our soldiers,  just as our soldiers stand up for us! Together we stand for our Volk and our community and  we will never capitulate. Our enemies can continue this war for as long as they are able to.  What we can do to defeat them, we will do! That they will ever defeat us is impossible and  out of the question. Only National Socialist Germany and its allied states, as young nations,  true people and true people’s states, will emerge from this war after a glorious victory!\"\n",

            "        \"transcript\": \"For months a problem has tormented all of us. Long ago the Diktat of Versailles  bestowed this problem on us. In its depravity and degeneracy it has now become  insufferable. Danzig was a German city and is a German city! The Corridor was  German and is German! These regions owe their cultural development exclusively to the  German Volk. Without this Volk, these eastern regions would still be plunged in the depths of  barbarism.  Danzig was torn from us! Poland annexed the Corridor! The German minorities living  there are being persecuted in the vilest manner imaginable. In the years 1919 and 1920 over  one million men of German blood were forced to leave their homeland.  As always, I sought to bring about a change by peaceful means, by offering proposals to  remedy this situation which meanwhile had become unbearable.  It is a lie when others in the world claim that we sought to carry out our revisions by the  use of force exclusively. Fifteen years before National Socialism’s rise to power, there was  ample opportunity to carry out these revisions by peaceful means. Nothing of the sort was  done. In any event, I made proposals for a revision not once, but many times.  You know that all these proposals were rejected. There is no need for me to enumerate  them: my proposals on the limitation of arms; if necessary, even for the complete elimination  of weaponry; my proposals for limited warfare, for the abolition of methods employed in  modern warfare which, in my eyes, are hardly reconcilable with international law. You know  of my proposals on the necessity of restoring German sovereignty to the territory of the  German Reich. You know of the endless attempts I made for a peaceful resolution of the  problem of Austria, and later of the problem of the Sudetenland, of Bohemia and Moravia. It  was all for naught.  There is one thing that is simply not possible: to demand that an impossible situation be  resolved by means of peaceful revision-and then to consistently deny resolution by peaceful  means.  It is likewise not possible to claim that the one who, under the circumstances, resorts to  resolving this situation by himself, who undertakes the revisions on his own, is in breach of  the law. For the Diktat of Versailles does not constitute law for us Germans.  You simply cannot uphold and proclaim a signature to represent sanctified law when it  was extorted by holding a pistol to the signatory’s head and threatening to starve millions of  human beings if he failed to comply! Thus I attempted, also in the case of Danzig and the  Corridor, to obtain a resolution by means of proposals and their peaceful discussion. That  these problems had to be resolved was entirely clear. That the western states were  unconcerned with the time table is understandable. Yet it is of concern to us.  It was-and had to be-of concern especially to those suffering.  In my talks with Polish statesmen I once more expounded those thoughts which you  already heard in my last speech before the Reichstag. No man can accuse me of employing  inappropriate methods or of applying inappropriate pressure in an uncalled-for manner. It was  I who had the German proposals formulated in the end, and I must repeat here that there is  nothing more modest or loyal than these proposals. I should like to say this to the world: I  alone was in the position to make such proposals! I know very well that in doing so I brought  myself into opposition to millions of Germans. These proposals have been rejected. And not  only this! They were answered by mobilization, augmented terror, increasing pressure on  ethnic Germans in these regions. The previously slow and exclusively economic and political  throttling of the Free City of Danzig within the last few weeks has spilled over into an  outright war against it, a choking off of traffic there and military isolation.  Poland has unleashed this war against the Free City of Danzig! It was not willing to  settle the question of the Corridor in one manner or another, in a manner both reasonable and  rendering justice to the interests of both states.  And ultimately this meant that it was not willing to uphold its obligations toward  minorities.  And here I must establish the fact that Germany has fulfilled its obligations! The  minorities living within the Reich are not subject to persecution. There is not one Frenchman  who can stand up to claim that the French in the Saar territory are being oppressed, tortured,  or robbed of their rights. Not one can claim as much! I have been silently standing by and  observing the situation for four months now. Yet I have issued warnings repeatedly. And I  have intensified these warnings of late.  As long as three weeks ago, I already had the Polish Ambassador informed that if  Poland should send further notes to Danzig, in the nature of an ultimatum; if it should  implement further discriminatory measures against the Germans there; or if it should attempt  to destroy Danzig economically by imposing high customs on it; then Germany could simply  no longer be expected to stand by without taking action.  I left no doubt that it would be a grave mistake in this context to compare the Germany  of today to the Germany of days past.  There were attempts to justify recriminations against ethnic Germans by claiming that  these constituted a response to prior “provocations.” I know not what type of “provocations”  those women and children had allegedly perpetrated who were abused and abducted. Nor can  I imagine what provocations had been perpetrated by those who were sadistically and  bestlially tortured only to be murdered in the end.  Yet there is one thing I do know: no honorable great power could calmly tolerate such a  state of affairs in the long run! Nevertheless, I made one last effort. And this even though, in  my heart, I was convinced that the Polish Government-especially given its dependence on the  rabble of soldiers now freed of inhibitions-was not serious about attaining a true  understanding. Nevertheless, I accepted the proposal at mediation of the British Government.  The British suggested that while they were not willing to negotiate themselves, they would  open a direct line of communication between Poland and Germany to initiate talks once more.  And now I am forced to state the following: I accepted this proposal! It was for this new  round of negotiations that I drafted the proposals known to you.  For two whole days I sat with my Government and waited to see whether it was  convenient for the Polish Government to send a plenipotentiary or not.  Up to last night, it has not commissioned any such plenipotentiary. Rather it has  informed us, through the offices of its Ambassador, that it is presently contemplating whether  or not it is in a position to consider the English proposals. It would impart as much to England  later.  My Deputies! Should someone have the impertinence to expect the German Reich and  its head of state to accept this, and should the German Reich and its head of state tolerate this,  then truly the German nation would deserve no better than to take leave of the political stage!  For I am wrongly judged if my love for peace and my patience are mistaken for weakness or  even cowardice! Last night I informed the British Government that, under the circumstances, I  no longer see any willingness by the Polish Government to enter into serious negotiations  with us. And thus all attempts at mediation must be considered to have failed. For we had  indeed received a response to our proposals which consisted of: 1. general mobilization in  Poland and 2. renewed, heinous atrocities.  Similar events repeated themselves in the course of last night. And this after the recent  perpetration of twenty-one border transgressions in the span of one single night. Yesterday  fourteen additional violations of the border were recorded, among them three of a most  serious nature. I have therefore resolved to speak to Poland in the same language that Poland  has employed towards us in the months past.  Now that statesmen in the West go about declaring that this infringes on their interests, I  can only regret this position. This cannot and will not, however, make me waver for a minute  in the fulfillment of my duty. I have solemnly assured the Western states, and I repeat this  here, that we desire nothing of them. We shall never demand anything of them. I have assured  them that the border separating France and Germany is a final one. Time and time again I  have offered friendship, and if necessary close cooperation, to England. But love cannot  remain a one-sided affair. It must be met by the other side.  Germany is not pursuing any interests in the West. The West Wall delineates the  Reich’s border for all time. Our ambitions for the future are no different. And nothing shall  ever change the Reich’s standpoint in this matter.  The other European states, in part, comprehend our stance. Here I wish, above all, to  thank Italy, which lent us support during this entire time. You will understand that we do not  wish to appeal to a foreign power for assistance in this struggle. This is our task, and we shall  carry it out ourselves.  The neutral states have already assured us of their neutrality. We earlier guaranteed this  neutrality. We are deadly serious (es ist uns heiliger Ernst) in making this assertion. As long  as other powers do not violate this neutrality, we shall likewise respect it scrupulously. For  how could we wish to, or desire to, conduct ourselves differently towards these states? I am  happy to be able to inform you of a special development at this point.  You know that two different doctrines govern Russia and Germany. There remained but  one question to be resolved: as Germany has no intent of exporting its doctrine, and at the  moment that Soviet Russia no longer contemplates exporting its doctrine to Germany, I no  longer see any compelling reason why we should continue to take opposing stances. Both of  us are aware that any struggle between our two peoples would merely benefit third parties.  Hence we have determined to enter into a pact which shall preclude the application of force  between us for all time. It also obliges us to seek mutual consultation in certain European  questions. Moreover, it shall render possible economic cooperation and, above all, ensure that  the strength of the two great states is not squandered in rivalry with each other.  Any attempt by the West to change this is doomed to failure! And of one thing I would  like to assure all of you here today: this decision signals a fundamental change for the future  and is a final one! I believe the entire German Volk welcomes this political resolve. Russia  and Germany fought each other in the World War only to suffer its consequences equally in  the end. This shall not happen a second time! Yesterday in Moscow and Berlin, the NonAggression and Mutual Assistance Pact-which had originally entered into force upon  signature-was accorded final ratification. In Moscow this pact was as warmly welcomed as  you welcomed it here. I second every word of the Russian Foreign Commissar Molotov’s  speech.  Our goals: I am determined to resolve  1. the question of Danzig and  2. the question of the Corridor, and to see to it that  3. a change of tone comes about in German-Polish relations, so as to warrant peaceful  coexistence.  Meanwhile I am equally determined to wage this war until the present Polish  Government judges it opportune to assent to these changes, or another Polish Government  shall be willing to do so.  I will cleanse Germany’s borders of this element of insecurity, this civilwar- like  circumstance. I will take care that our border in the East enjoys the same peace as along any  other of our borders.  I will take the measures necessary in a fashion that does not contradict what I have  pronounced to be my proposals to the world before you, my Deputies.  This means I do not wish to lead this war against women and children. I have instructed  my Luftwaffe to limit its attacks to military objectives. Should, however, the enemy regard  this as giving him license to employ reverse measures against us, then he shall receive so  powerful a response that stars dance before his eyes! This night for the first time Polish  regular soldiers fired on our own territory. We have now been returning the fire since 5:45  a.m.!(Seit 5.45 Uhr wird jetzt zuruckgeschossen!) Henceforth, bomb will be met with bomb.  He who fights with poison shall be fought with poison gas. He who distances himself  from the rules for a humane conduct of warfare can only expect us to take like steps. I will  lead this struggle, whoever may be the adversary, until the security of the Reich and its rights  have been assured.  For over six years I worked on the rearmament of the German Wehrmacht. I have spent  over 90 billion on the rearmament of the Wehrmacht. Today it is among the best-equipped in  the entire world. It completely defies comparison to that of 1914! My confidence in it is  unshakeable! When I call on this Wehrmacht, and when I now demand sacrifice from the  German Volk, even the ultimate sacrifice should there be need, then it is because I have a  right to do this, because today I am as willing as I was before to make any personal sacrifice. I  am asking of no German man more than I myself was ready to do through four years!  Germans should not be asked to make any sacrifices I myself would not make without an  instant’s hesitation!I now wish to be nothing other than the first soldier of the German Reich.  Therefore I have put on that tunic which has always been the most holy and dear to me.  I shall not take it off again until after victory is ours, or-I shall not live to see the day! Should  something happen to me in this struggle, then my immediate successor shall be Party comrade  Goring.  Should anything happen to Party comrade Goring, then his successor shall be Party  comrade Hess. You shall owe this man-as your Fuhrer-the same loyalty and blind obedience  you owe to my person! Should anything happen to Party comrade Hess, then through the  offices of law I shall call upon the Senate, which is to determine the most worthy, i.e. the  most valiant from its midst. As a National Socialist and a German soldier I enter into this  struggle with a strong heart! My life was but one struggle for the German Volk, for its  resurrection, for Germany. This struggle was governed by only one creed: faith in this Volk!  There is one word which I have never known and this word is: capitulation! If some now  believe that we are facing hard times, then I would like to ask them to bear in mind that once a  Prussian king with a ludicrously small state faced off a far more powerful coalition. And three  battles later he stood victorious in the end, for he possessed that strong, believing heart, the  kind which we need in these times as well. I would like to assure the world around us of one  thing: there shall never ever be another November 1918 in German history! Since I myself  stand ever ready to lay down my life for my Volk and Germany, I demand the same of  everyone else! Whoever believes he can oppose this national commandment shall fall! We  will have nothing to do with traitors! And all of us pledge ourselves to the one ancient  principle: it is of no importance if we ourselves live-as long as our Volk lives, as long as  Germany lives! This is essential.  I expect of all of you as the Reich’s emissaries henceforth that you shall do your duty  wherever you may be assigned! You must carry the banner of resistance forth regardless of  the cost.  May no one approach me to report one day that morale is low in his Gau, in his Kreis,  or in his group or cell. The one responsible for morale is you- the responsibility is yours! I am  the one responsible for the morale of the German Volk. You are responsible for morale in  your Gaus, in your Kreise! No one has the right to cast off this responsibility. The sacrifices  demanded of us today are no greater than those made by countless earlier generations. All  men who have set out on this most bitter and strenuous of paths for Germany have  accomplished nothing else than what we must also accomplish. Their sacrifice was not made  without cost or suffering. It was no easier to make than the one demanded of us.  I expect every German woman to integrate herself into the great community-in-struggle  in an exemplary fashion and with iron discipline! It goes without saying that the German  youth will fulfill, with a radiant heart, the tasks the nation, the National Socialist state, expects  and demands of it. Provided all of us form part of this community, sworn together, determined  never to capitulate, then our will shall master all need.  I conclude with the avowal I once pronounced as I began my struggle for power in the  Reich. Back then I said: When our will is strong enough that need can no longer vanquish it,  then our will and our German state will vanquish and conquer need.\"\n",

The weight of  those you personify here each year has become consistently greater. Not only in  terms of quantity, oh no; we can see it: in terms of quality. If I think back on the first roll call  and on the second and compare them to this one today, I can see the same development we  see evidenced throughout the rest of German Volksleben: our Volk is becoming increasingly  disciplined, sturdier, more taut- and youth is beginning to as well. The ideal of the man has  been subjected to different views in our Volk as well. There were times-they seem to be long  ago and are almost incomprehensible to us-when the ideal of the young German man was, to  use the jargon, a beer-drinking, hard-living fellow.  Today we are happy to note that the ideal is no longer the beer-drinking and hardliving  young man, but the tough young man, impervious to wind and weather. For the main thing is  not how many glasses of beer he can drink, but how many blows he can withstand; not how  long he can make the rounds night after night, but how many kilometers he can march.  Today the beer-happy bourgeois (Bierspiesser) of those times is no longer regarded as  the ideal of the German Volk, but men and girls who are fit as a fiddle, who are string taut.  What we want from our German youth is different from what the past wanted of it. In our  eyes, the German youth of the future must be slender and supple, swift as greyhounds, tough  as leather, and hard as Krupp steel. We must cultivate a new man in order to prevent the ruin  of our Volk by the degeneration manifested in our age.\"\n",

After this we shall discuss military details.  It was clear to me that a conflict with Poland had to come sooner or later. I had already  made this decision in the spring, but I thought that I would first turn against the West in a few  years, and only after that against the East. But the sequence of these things cannot be fixed.  Nor should one close one’s eyes to threatening situations. I wanted first of all to establish a  tolerable relationship with Poland in order to fight first against the West. But this plan, which  appealed to me, could not be executed, as fundamental points had changed. It became clear to  me that, in the event of a conflict with the West, Poland would attack us. Poland is striving for  access to the sea. The further developmet appeared after the occupation of the Memel  Territory and it became clear to me that in certain circumstances a conflict with Poland might  come at an inopportune moment. I give as reasons for this conclusion: 1. First of all two  personal factors: My own personality and that of Mussolini.  Essentially all depends on me, on my existence, because of my political talents.  Furthermore, the fact that probably no one will ever again have the confidence of the whole  German people as I have. There will probably never again in the future be a man with more  authority than I have. My existence is therefore a fact of great value. But I can be eliminated  at any time by a criminal or a lunatic.  The second personal factor is the Duce. His existence is absolutely decisive.  If anything happens to him, Italy’s loyalty to the alliance will no longer be certain. The  Italian Court is fundamentally opposed to the Duce. Above all, the Court regards the  expansion of the empire as an encumbrance. The Duce is the man with the strongest nerves in  Italy.  The third personal factor in our favor is Franco. We can ask only for benevolent  neutrality from Spain. But this depends on Franco’s personality.  He guarantees a certain uniformity and stability in the present system in Spain.  We must accept the fact that Spain does not yet have a Fascist party with our internal  unity.  The other side presents a negative picture as far as authoritative persons are concerned.  There is no outstanding personality in England and France.  It is easy for us to make decisions. We have nothing to lose; we have everything to gain.  Because of our restrictions (Einschrankungen) our economic situation is such that we can  only hold out for a few more years. Goring can confirm this. We have no other choice, we  must act. Our opponents will be risking a great deal and can gain only little. Britain’s stake in  a war is inconceivably great. Our enemies have leaders who are below the average. No  masters, no men of action.  Besides the personal factors, the political situation is favorable for us: In the  Mediterranean, rivalry between Italy, France and England; in the Far East, tension between  Japan and England; in the Middle East, tension which causes alarm in the Mohammedan  world.  The English Empire did not emerge stronger from the last war. Nothing was achieved  from the maritime point of view. Strife between England and Ireland. The Union of South  Africa has become more independent.  Concessions have had to be made to India. England is in the utmost peril.  Unhealthy industrialization. A British statesman can only view the future with concern.  France’s position has also deteriorated, above all in the Mediterranean.  Further factors in our favor are these: Since Albania, there has been a balance of power  in the Balkans. Yugoslavia is infected with the fatal germ of decay because of her internal  situation.  Rumania has not grown stronger. She is open to attack and vulnerable. She is threatened  by Hungary and Bulgaria. Since Kemal’s death, Turkey has been ruled by petty minds,  unsteady, weak men.  All these favorable circumstances will no longer prevail in two or three years’ time. No  one knows how much longer I shall live. Therefore, better a conflict now.  The creation of Greater Germany was a great achievement politically, but militarily it  was doubtful, since it was achieved by bluff on the part of the political leaders. It is necessary  to test the military [machine]. If at all possible, not in a general reckoning, but by the  accomplishment of individual tasks.  The relationship with Poland has become unbearable. My Polish policy hitherto was  contrary to the views of the people. My proposals to Poland (Danzig and the Corridor) were  frustrated by England’s intervention. Poland changed her tone towards us. A permanent state  of tension is intolerable. The power of initiative cannot be allowed to pass to others. The  present moment is more favorable than in two or three years’ time. An attempt on my life or  Mussolini’s could change the situation to our disadvantage. One cannot forever face one  another with rifles cocked. One compromise solution suggested to us was that we should  change our convictions and make kind gestures. They talked to us again in the language of  Versailles. There was a danger of losing prestige. Now the probability is still great that the  West will not intervene. We must take the risk with ruthless determination. The politician  must take a risk just as much as the general. We are faced with the harsh alternatives of  striking or certain annihilation sooner or later.  Reference to previous hazardous undertakings.  I should have been stoned if I had not been proven right. The most dangerous step was  the entry into the neutral zone. Only a week before, I got a warning through France. I have  always taken a great risk in the conviction that it would succeed.  Now it is also a great risk. Iron nerves, iron resolution.  The following special reasons fortify me in my view. England and France have  undertaken obligations which neither is in a position to fulfil. There is no real rearmament in  England, but only propaganda. A great deal of harm was done by many Germans, who were  not in agreement with me, saying and writing to English people after the solution of the Czech  question: The Fuhrer succeeded because you lost your nerve, because you capitulated too  soon. This explains the present propaganda war. The English speak of a war of nerves. One  factor in this war of nerves is to boost the increase of armaments. But what are the real facts  about British rearmament? The naval construction program for 1938 has not yet been  completed. Only the reserve fleet has been mobilized.  Purchase of trawlers. No substantial strengthening of the Navy before 1941 or 1942.  Little has been done on land. England will be able to send at most three divisions to the  Continent. A little has been done for the Air Force, but only a beginning. Anti-aircraft defense  is in its initial stages. At the moment England has only 150 anti-aircraft guns. The new antiaircraft gun has been ordered. It will take a long time before sufficient numbers have been  produced. There is a shortage of anti-aircraft warning devices. England is still vulnerable from  the air.  This can change in two or three years. At the moment the English Air Force has only  130,000 men, France 72,000, Poland 15,000. England does not want the conflict to break out  for two or three years.  The following is typical for England. Poland wanted a loan from England for her  rearmament. England, however, only granted credits in order to make sure that Poland buy in  England, although England cannot make deliveries. This suggests that England does not really  want to support Poland. She is not risking eight million pounds in Poland, although she  poured five hundred million into China. England’s position in the world is too precarious. She  will not take any risks.  France is short of men (decline in the birth rate). Little has been done for rearmament.  The artillery is obsolete. France did not want to embark on this adventure. The West has only  two possibilities for fighting against us:  1. Blockade: It will not be effective because of our autarky and because we have sources  of supply in Eastern Europe.  2. Attack in the West from the Maginot line: I consider this impossible.  Another possibility would be the violation of Dutch, Belgian and Swiss neutrality. I  have no doubt that all these States, as well as Scandinavia, will defend their neutrality with all  available means. England and France will not violate the neutrality of these countries. Thus in  actual fact England cannot help Poland. There still remains an attack on Italy. Military  intervention is out of the question. No one is counting on a long war. If Herr von Brauchitsch  had told me that I would need four years to conquer Poland I would have replied: “Then it  cannot be done.” It is nonsense to say that England wants to wage a long war. We will hold  our position in the West until we have conquered Poland. We must bear in mind our great  production capacity. It is much greater than in 1914–1918.  The enemy had another hope, that Russia would become our enemy after the conquest  of Poland. The enemy did not reckon with my great strength of purpose. Our enemies are little  worms (kleine Wurmchen); I came to know them in Munich. I was convinced that Stalin  would never accept the English offer. Russia has no interest in preserving Poland, and Stalin  knows that it would mean the end of his regime, no matter whether his soldiers emerged from  a war victorious or vanquished. Litvinov’s replacement was decisive. I brought about the  change towards Russia gradually. In connection with the commercial treaty we got into  political conversations. Proposal for a non-aggression pact. Then came a comprehensive  proposal from Russia. Four days ago I took a special step, which led to Russia replying  yesterday that she is prepared to sign. Personal contact to Stalin is established. The day after  tomorrow von Ribbentrop will conclude the treaty.  Now Poland is in the position in which I wanted her.  We need not be afraid of a blockade. The East will supply us with grain, cattle, coal,  lead and zinc. It is a mighty aim, which demands great efforts. I am only afraid that at the last  moment some cur (Schweinehund) or other will yet submit to me a plan for mediation.  The political objective goes further. A start has been made on the destruction of  England’s hegemony. The way will be open for the soldiers after I have made the political  preparations.  Today’s announcement of the non-aggression pact with Russia came as a bombshell.  The consequences cannot be foreseen. Stalin also said that this course will benefit both  countries. The effect on Poland will be tremendous.\"\n",

At her own  wish, she will go into death with me as my wife. This will compensate us both for what my  work in the service of my Volk took from us.

Should the state be destroyed, then any further directives  by me would be superfluous.  The paintings in the collections that I bought over the years I never intended for private  purposes, but for the establishment of a gallery in my home town of Linz on the Danube.  It is my most heartfelt wish that this bequest be executed.  As the executor of my testament, I appoint my dearest party comrade Martin  Bormann.213 He will be entitled to make all decisions final and legal.

On the one hand, I was summoned by my Country, whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love, from a retreat which I had chosen with the fondest predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable decision, as the asylum of my declining years: a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me, by the addition of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time. On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my Country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens, a distrustful scrutiny into his qualification, could not but overwhelm with dispondence, one, who, inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpractised in the duties of civil administration, ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficencies. In this conflict of emotions, all I dare aver, is, that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance, by which it might be affected. All I dare hope, is, that, if in executing this task I have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances, or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof, of the confidence of my fellow-citizens; and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me; my error will be palliated by the motives which misled me, and its consequences be judged by my Country, with some share of the partiality in which they originated.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the public summons, repaired to the present station; it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official Act, my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the Universe, who presides in the Councils of Nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the People of the United States, a Government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes: and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success, the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the Great Author of every public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own; nor those of my fellow-citizens at large, less than either. No People can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand, which conducts the Affairs of men more than the People of the United States. Every step, by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation, seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency. And in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their United Government, the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities, from which the event has resulted, cannot be compared with the means by which most Governments have been established, without some return of pious gratitude along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage. These reflections, arising out of the present crisis, have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed. You will join with me I trust in thinking, that there are none under the influence of which, the proceedings of a new and free Government can more auspiciously commence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the article establishing the Executive Department, it is made the duty of the President \\\"to recommend to your consideration, such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\\\" The circumstances under which I now meet you, will acquit me from entering into that subject, farther than to refer to the Great Constitutional Charter under which you are assembled; and which, in defining your powers, designates the objects to which your attention is to be given. It will be more consistent with those circumstances, and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me, to substitute, in place of a recommendation of particular measures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them. In these honorable qualifications, I behold the surest pledges, that as on one side, no local prejudices, or attachments; no seperate views, nor party animosities, will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests: so, on another, that the foundations of our National policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality; and the pre-eminence of a free Government, be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its Citizens, and command the respect of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nI dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my Country can inspire: since there is no truth more thoroughly established, than that there exists in the oeconomy and course of nature, an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness, between duty and advantage, between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy, and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity: Since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of Heaven, can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right, which Heaven itself has ordained: And since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the Republican model of Government, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked, on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the ordinary objects submitted to your care, it will remain with your judgment to decide, how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the Fifth article of the Constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the System, or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them. Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities, I shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good: For I assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an United and effective Government, or which ought to await the future lessons of experience; a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen, and a regard for the public harmony, will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be more impregnably fortified, or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the preceeding observations I have one to add, which will be most properly addressed to the House of Representatives. It concerns myself, and will therefore be as brief as possible. When I was first honoured with a call into the Service of my Country, then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated my duty required that I should renounce every pecuniary compensation. From this resolution I have in no instance departed. And being still under the impressions which produced it, I must decline as inapplicable to myself, any share in the personal emoluments, which may be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the Executive Department; and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the Station in which I am placed, may, during my continuance in it, be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving thus imparted to you my sentiments, as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together, I shall take my present leave; but not without resorting once more to the benign parent of the human race, in humble supplication that since he has been pleased to favour the American people, with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquility, and dispositions for deciding with unparellelled unanimity on a form of Government, for the security of their Union, and the advancement of their happiness; so his divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged views, the temperate consultations, and the wise measures on which the success of this Government must depend.\\r\\n\",\"president\":\"George Washington\",\"title\":\"April 30, 1789: First Inaugural Address\"},{\"doc_name\":\"april-5-1792-veto-message-congressional-redistricting\",\"date\":\"1792-04-05\",\"transcript\":\" Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I have maturely considered   the Act passed by the two Houses, intitled, &quot;An Act for an apportionment   of Representatives among the several States according to the first enumeration,&quot;   44 and I return it to your House, wherein it originated, with the following   objections.

In that long space of time many good men have considered how the condition of the Indian natives of the country might be improved; and many attempts have been made to effect it. But, as we see at this day, all these attempts have been nearly fruitless. I also have thought much on this subject, and anxiously wished that the various Indian tribes, as well as their neighbours, the White people, might enjoy in abundance all the good things which make life comfortable and happy. I have considered how this could be done; and have discovered but one path that could lead them to that desirable situation. In this path I wish all the Indian nations to walk. From the information received concerning you, my beloved Cherokees, I am inclined to hope that you are prepared to take this path and disposed to pursue it. It may seem a little difficult to enter; but if you make the attempt, you will find every obstacle easy to be removed. Mr. Dinsmoor, my beloved agent to your nation, being here, I send you this talk by him. He will have it interpreted to you, and particularly explain my meaning.\\n\\nBeloved Cherokees,\\n\\nYou now find that the game with which your woods once abounded, are growing scarce; and you know when you cannot meet a deer or other game to kill, that you must remain hungry; you know also when you can get no skins by hunting, that the traders will give you neither powder nor cloathing; and you know that without other implements for tilling the ground than the hoe, you will continue to raise only scanty crops of corn. Hence you are sometimes exposed to suffer much from hunger and cold; and as the game are lessening in numbers more and more, these sufferings will increase. And how are you to provide against them? Listen to my words and you will know.\\n\\nMy beloved Cherokees,\\n\\nSome among you already experience the advantage of keeping cattle and hogs: let all keep them and increase their numbers, and you will ever have a plenty\\nof meet. To these add sheep, and they will give you cloathing as well as food. Your lands are good and of great extent. By proper management you can raise live stock not only for your own wants, but to sell to the White people. By using the plow you can vastly increase your crops of corn. You can also grow wheat, (which makes the best bread) as well as other useful grain. To these you will easily add flax and cotton, which you may dispose of to the White people, or have it made up by your own women into cloathing for yourselves. Your wives and daughters can soon learn to spin and weave; and to make this certain, I have directed Mr. Dinsmoor, to procure all the necessary apparatus for spinning and weaving, and to hire a woman to teach the use of them. He will also procure some plows and other implements of husbandry, with which to begin the improved cultivation of the ground which I recommend, and employ a fit person to shew you how they are to be used. I have further directed him to procure some cattle and sheep for the most prudent and industrious men, who shall be willing to exert themselves in tilling the ground and raising those useful animals. He is often to talk with you on these subjects, and give you all necessary information to promote your success. I must therefore desire you to listen to him; and to follow his advice. I appointed him to dwell among you as the Agent of the United States, because I judged him to be a faithful man, ready to obey my instructions and to do you good.\\n\\nBut the cares of the United States are not confined to your single nation.\\nThey extend to all the Indians dwelling on their borders. For which reason other agents are appointed; and for the four southern nations there will be a general or principal agent who will visit all of them, for the purpose of maintaining peace and friendship among them and with the United States; to superintend all their affairs; and to assist the particular agents with each nation in doing the business assigned them. To such general or principal agent I must desire your careful attention. He will be one of our greatly beloved men. His whole time will be employed in contriving how to do you good, and you will therefore act wisely to follow his advice. The first general or principal agent will be Colonel Benjamin Hawkins, a man already known and respected by you. I have chosen him for this office because he is esteemed for a good man; has a knowledge of Indian customs, and a particular love and friendship for all the Southern tribes.\\n\\nBeloved Cherokees,\\n\\nWhat I have recommended to you I am myself going to do. After a few moons are passed I shall leave the great town and retire to my farm. There I shall attend to the means of increasing my cattle, sheep and other useful animals; to the growing of corn, wheat, and other grain, and to the employing of women in spinning and weaving; all which I have recommended to you, that you may be as comfortable and happy as plenty of food, clothing and other good things can make you.\\n\\nBeloved Cherokees,\\n\\nWhen I have retired to my farm I shall hear of you; and it will give me great pleasure to know that you have taken my advice, and are walking in the path which I have described. But before I retire, I shall speak to my beloved man, the Secretary of War, to get prepared some medals, to be given to such Cherokees as by following my advice shall best deserve them. For this purpose Mr. Dinsmoor is from time to time to visit every town in your nation. He will give instructions to those who desire to learn what I have recommended. He will see what improvements are made; who are most industrious in raising cattle; in growing corn, wheat, cotton and flax; and in spinning and weaving; and on those who excel these rewards are to be bestowed.\\n\\nBeloved Cherokees,\\n\\nThe advice I here give you is important as it regards your nation; but still\\nmore important as the event of the experiment made with you may determine the\\nlot of many nations. If it succeeds, the beloved men of the United States will be encouraged to give the same assistance to all the Indian tribes within their boundaries. But if it should fail, they may think it vain to make any further attempts to better the condition of any Indian tribe; for the richness of the soil and mildness of the air render your country highly favorable for the practice of what I have recommended.\\n\\nBeloved Cherokees,\\n\\nThe wise men of the United States meet together once a year, to consider what\\nwill be for the good of all their people. The wise men of each separate state also meet together once or twice every year, to consult and do what is good for the people of their respective states. I have thought that a meeting of your wise men once or twice a year would be alike useful to you. Every town might send one or two of its wisest counsellors to talk together on the affairs of your nation, and to recommend to your people whatever they should think would be serviceable. The beloved agent of the United States would meet with them. He would give them information of those things which are found good by the white people, and which your situation will enable you to adopt. He would explain to them the laws made by the great council of the United States, for the preservation of peace; for the protection of your lands; for the security of your persons; for your improvement in the arts of living, and for promoting your general welfare. If it should be agreeable to you that your wise men should hold such meetings, you will speak your mind to my beloved man, Mr. Dinsmoor, to be communicated to the President of the United States, who will give such directions as shall be proper.\\n\\nBeloved Cherokees,\\n\\nThat this talk may be known to all your nation, and not forgotten, I have caused it to be printed, and directed one, signed by my own hand, to be lodged in each of your towns. The Interpreters will, on proper occasions, read and interpret the same to all your people.\\n\\nBeloved Cherokees,\\n\\nHaving been informed that some of your chiefs wished to see me in Philadelphia, I have sent them word that I would receive a few of the most esteemed.

by endeavors to deter those who might be so disposed from accepting offices under them through fear of public resentment and of injury to person and property, and to compel those who had accepted such offices by actual violence to surrender or forbear the execution of them; by circulating vindictive menaces against all those who should otherwise, directly or indirectly, aid in the execution of the said laws, or who, yielding to the dictates of conscience and to a sense of obligation, should themselves comply therewith;

by intercepting the public officers on the highways, abusing, assaulting, and otherwise ill treating them; by going to their houses in the night, gaining admittance by force, taking away their papers, and committing other outrages, employing for these unwarrantable purposes the agency of armed banditti disguised in such manner as for the most part to escape discovery;

having repeatedly attacked the said house with the persons therein, wounding some of them; having seized David Lenox, marshal of the district of Pennsylvania, who previous thereto had been fired upon while in the execution of his duty by a party of armed men, detaining him for some time prisoner, till for the preservation of his life and the obtaining of his liberty he found it necessary to enter into stipulations to forbear the execution of certain official duties touching processes issuing out of a court of the United States; and having finally obliged the said inspector of the said revenue and the said marshal from considerations of personal safety to fly from that part of the country, in order, by a circuitous route, to proceed to the seat of Government, avowing as the motives of these outrageous proceedings an intention to prevent by force of arms the execution of the said laws, to oblige the said inspector of the revenue to renounce his said office, to withstand by open violence the lawful authority of the Government of the United States, and to compel thereby an alteration in the measures of the Legislature and a repeal of the laws aforesaid;

I have received your Speech with satisfaction, as a proof of your confidence   in the justice of the United States, and I have attentively examined the several   objects which you have laid before me, whether delivered by your Chiefs at Tioga   point in the last month to Colonel Pickering, or laid before me in the present   month by the Cornplanter and the other Seneca Chiefs now in Philadelphia.  In the first place I observe to you, and I request it may sink deep in your   minds, that it is my desire, and the desire of the United States that all the   miseries of the late war should be forgotten and buried forever. That in future   the United States and the six Nations should be truly brothers, promoting each   other's prosperity by acts of mutual friendship and justice.  I am not uninformed that the six Nations have been led into some difficulties   with respect to the sale of their lands since the peace. But I must inform you   that these evils arose before the present government of the United States was   established, when the separate States and individuals under their authority,   undertook to treat with the Indian tribes respecting the sale of their lands.  But the case is now entirely altered. The general Government only has the   power, to treat with the Indian Nations, and any treaty formed and held without   its authority will not be binding.  Here then is the security for the remainder of your lands. No State nor person   can purchase your lands, unless at some public treaty held under the authority   of the United States. The general government will never consent to your being   defrauded. But it will protect you in all your just rights.  Hear well, and let it be heard by every person in your Nation, That the President   of the United States declares, that the general government considers itself   bound to protect you in all the lands secured you by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix,   the 22d of October 1784, excepting such parts as you may since had fairly sold   to persons properly authorized to purchase of you.  You complain that John Livingston and Oliver Phelps have obtained your lands,   assisted by Mr. Street of Niagara, and they have not complied with their agreement.  It appears upon enquiry of the Governor of New York, that John Livingston   was not legally authorized to treat with you, and that every thing he did with   you has been declared null and void, so that you may rest easy on that account.  But it does not appear from any proofs yet in the possession of government,   that Oliver Phelps has defrauded you.  If however you should have any just cause of complaint against him, and can   make satisfactory proof thereof, the federal Courts will be open to you for   redress, as to all other persons.  But your great object seems to be the security of your remaining lands, and   I have therefore upon this point, meant to be sufficiently strong and clear.  That in future you cannot be defrauded of your lands. That you possess the   right to sell, and the right of refusing to sell your lands.  That therefore the sale of your lands in future, will depend entirely upon   yourselves.  But that when you may find it for your interest to sell any parts of your   lands, the United States must be present by their Agent, and will be your security   that you shall not be defrauded in the bargain you may make.  [It will however be important, that before you make any sales of your land   that you should determine among yourselves, who are the persons among you that   shall give sure conveyances thereof as shall be binding upon your Nation and   forever preclude all disputes related to the validity of the sale.]  That besides the [before mentioned] security for your land, you will perceive   by the law of Congress, for regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian   tribes, the fatherly care the United States intend to take of the Indians. For   the particular meaning of this law, I refer you to the explanations given thereof   by Colonel Pickering at Tioga, which with the law, are herewith delivered to   you.  You have said in your Speech &quot;That the game is going away from among   you, and that you thought it the design of the great Spirit, that you should   till the ground, but before you speak upon this subject, you want to know whether   the United States meant to leave you any land to till?&quot;  You now know that all the lands secured to you by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix,   excepting such parts as you may since have fairly sold are yours, and that only   your own acts can convey them away; speak therefore your wishes on the subject   of tilling the ground. The United States will be happy to afford you every assistance   in the only business which will add to your numbers and happiness.  The murders that have been committed upon some of your people, by the bad   white men I sincerely lament and reprobate, and I earnestly hope that the real   murderers will be secured, and punished as they deserve. This business has been   sufficiently explained to you here, by the Governor of Pennsylvania, and by   Colonel Pickering on behalf of the United States, at Tioga.  The Senekas may be assured, that the rewards offered for apprehending the   murderers, will be continued until they are secured for trial, and that when   they shall be apprehended, that they will be tried and punished as if they had   killed white men.  Having answered the most material parts of your Speech, I shall inform you,   that some bad Indians, and the outcast of several tribes who reside at the Miamee   Village, have long continued their murders and depredations upon the frontiers,   lying along the Ohio. That they have not only refused to listen to my voice   inviting them to peace, but that upon receiving it, they renewed their incursions   and murders with greater violence than ever. I have therefore been obliged to   strike those bad people, in order to make them sensible of their madness. I   sincerely hope they will hearken to reason, and not require to be further chastised.   The United States desire to be the friends of the Indians, upon terms of justice   and humanity. But they will not suffer the depredations of the bad Indians to   go unpunished.  My desire is that you would caution all the Senekas and six Nations, to. prevent   their rash young men from joining the Miamee Indians. For the United States   cannot distinguish the tribes to which bad Indians belong, and every tribe must   take care of their own people.  The merits of the Cornplanter, and his friendship for the United States are   well known to me, and shall not be forgotten. And as a mark of the esteem of   the United States, I have directed the Secretary of war to make him a present   of Two hundred and Fifty Dollars, either in money or goods, as the Cornplanter   shall like best. And he may depend upon the future care and kindness of the   United States. And I have also directed the Secretary of War to make suitable   presents to the other Chiefs present in Philadelphia. And also that some further   tokens of friendship to be forwarded to the other Chiefs, now in their Nation.  Remember my words Senekas, continue to be strong in your friendship for the   United States, as the only rational ground of your future happiness, and you   may rely upon their kindness and protection.  An Agent shall soon be appointed to reside in some place convenient to the   Senekas and six Nations. He will represent the United States. Apply to him on   all occasions.  If any man brings you evil reports of the intentions of the United States,   mark that man as your enemy, for he will mean to deceive you and lead you into   trouble. The United States will be true and faithful to their engagements.\",\"president\":\"George Washington\",\"title\":\"December 29, 1790: Talk to the Chiefs and Counselors of the Seneca Nation\"},{\"doc_name\":\"december-3-1793-fifth-annual-message-congress\",\"date\":\"1793-12-03\",\"transcript\":\"Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. Since the commencement of the term for which I have been again calledinto office no fit occasion has arisen for expressing to me fellow citizensat large the deep and respectful sense which I feel of the renewed testimonyof public approbation. While on the one hand it awakened my gratitude forall those instances of affectionate partiality with which I have been honoredby my country, on the other it could not prevent an earnest wish for thatretirement from which no private consideration should ever have torn me.But influenced by the belief that my conduct would be estimated accordingto its real motives, and that the people, and the authorities derived fromthem, would support exertions having nothing personal for their object,I have obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the Executive power;and I humbly implore that Being on whose will the fate of nations dependsto crown with success our mutual endeavors for the general happiness. As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom theUnited States have the most extensive relations there was reason to apprehendthat our intercourse with them might be interrupted and our dispositionfor peace drawn into question by the suspicions too often entertained bybelligerent nations. It seemed, therefore, to be my duty to admonish ourcitizens of the consequences of a contraband trade and of hostile actsto any of the parties, and to obtain by a declaration of the existing legalstate of things an easier admission of our right to the immunities belongingto our situation. Under these impressions the proclamation which will belaid before you was issued. In this posture of affairs, both new and delicate, I resolved to adoptgeneral rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the privilegesof the United States. These were reduced into a system, which will be communicatedto you. Although I have not thought of myself at liberty to forbid thesale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of commerce with France to bebrought into our ports, I have not refused to cause them to be restoredwhen they were taken within the protection of our territory, or by vesselscommissioned or equipped in a warlike form within the limits of the UnitedStates. It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct, improve, or enforcethis plan of procedure; and it will probably be found expedient to extendthe legal code and the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Statesto many cases which, though dependent on principles already recognized,demand some further provisions. Where individuals shall, within the United States, array themselvesin hostility against any of the powers at war, or enter upon military expeditionsor enterprises within the jurisdiction of the United States, or usurp andexercise judicial authority within the United States, or where the penaltieson violations of the law of nations may have been indistinctly marked,or are inadequate -- these offenses can not receive too early and closean attention, and require prompt and decisive remedies. Whatsoever those remedies may be, they will be well administered bythe judiciary, who possess a long-established course of investigation,effectual process, and officers in the habit of executing it. In like manner, as several of the courts have doubted, under particularcircumstances, their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peace,and even of a citizen of the United States, although seized under a falsecolor of being hostile property, and have denied their power to liberatecertain captures within the protection of our territory, it would seemproper to regulate their jurisdiction in these points. But if the Executiveis to be the resort in either of the two last-mentioned cases, it is hopedthat he will be authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courtswhen for his own information he shall request it. I can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of ourduties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the necessityof placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense and of exactingfrom them the fulfillment of their duties toward us. The United Statesought not to indulge a persuasion that, contrary to the order of humanevents, they will forever keep at a distance those painful appeals to armswith which the history of every other nation abounds. There is a rank dueto the United States among nations which will be withheld, if not absolutelylost, by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult, we mustbe able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerfulinstruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known that we are at alltimes ready for war. The documents which will be presented to you willshew the amount and kinds of arms and military stores now in our magazinesand arsenals; and yet an addition even to these supplies can not with prudencebe neglected, as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuringwarlike apparatus in the moment of public danger. Nor can such arrangements, with such objects, be exposed to the censureor jealousy of the warmest friends of republican government. They are incapableof abuse in the hands of the militia, who ought to possess a pride in beingthe depository of the force of the Republic, and may be trained to a degreeof energy equal to every military exigency of the United States. But itis an inquiry which can not be too solemnly pursued, whether the act \\\"moreeffectually to provide for the national defense by establishing an uniformmilitia throughout the United States\\\" has organized them so as to producetheir full effect; whether your own experience in the several States hasnot detected some imperfections in the scheme, and whether a material featurein an improvement of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity for thestudy of those branches of the military art which can scarcely ever beattained by practice alone. The connection of the United States with Europe has become extremelyinteresting. The occurrences which relate to it and have passed under theknowledge of the Executive will be exhibited to Congress in a subsequentcommunication. When we contemplate the war on our frontiers, it may be truly affirmedthat every reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissensionwith the Indians north of the Ohio. The instructions given to the commissionersevince a moderation and equity proceeding from a sincere love of peace,and a liberality having no restriction but the essential interests anddignity of the United States. The attempt, however, of an amicable negotiationhaving been frustrated, the troops have marched to act offensively. Althoughthe proposed treaty did not arrest the progress of military preparation,it is doubtful how far the advance of the season, before good faith justifiedactive movements, may retard them during the remainder of the year. Fromthe papers and intelligence which relate to this important subject youwill determine whether the deficiency in the number of troops granted bylaw shall be compensated by succors of militia, or additional encouragementsshall be proposed to recruits. An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive for peace withthe Creeks and the Cherokees. The former have been relieved with corn andwith clothing, and offensive measures against them prohibited during therecess of Congress. To satisfy the complaints of the latter, prosecutionshave been instituted for the violences committed upon them. But the paperswhich will be delivered to you disclose the critical footing on which westand in regard to both those tribes, and it is with Congress to pronouncewhat shall be done. After they shall have provided for the present emergency, it will merittheir most serious labors to render tranquillity with the savages permanentby creating ties of interest. Next to a rigorous execution of justice onthe violators of peace, the establishment of commerce with the Indian nationsin behalf of the United States is most likely to conciliate their attachment.But it ought to be conducted without fraud, without extortion, with constantand plentiful supplies, with a ready market for the commodities of theIndians and a stated price for what they give in payment and receive inexchange. Individuals will not pursue such a traffic unless they be alluredby the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the United States to bereimbursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the opinion ofCongress, they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by any meansyet in the hands of the Executive. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: The commissioners charged with the settlement of accounts between theUnited States and individual States concluded their important functionwithin the time limited by law, and the balances struck in their report,which will be laid before Congress, have been placed on the books of theTreasury. On the first day of June last an installment of 1,000,000 florins becamepayable on the loans of the United States in Holland. This was adjustedby a prolongation of the period of reimbursement in nature of a new loanat an interest of 5% for the term of ten years, and the expenses of thisoperation were a commission of 3%. The first installment of the loan of $2,000,000 from the Bank of theUnited States has been paid, as was directed by law. For the second itis necessary that provision be made. No pecuniary consideration is more urgent than the regular redemptionand discharge of the public debt. On none can delay be more injurious oran economy of time more valuable. The productiveness of the public revenues hitherto has continued toequal the anticipations which were formed of it, but it is not expectedto prove commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested. Someauxiliary provisions will therefore, it is presumed, be requisite, andit is hoped that these may be made consistently with a due regard to theconvenience of our citizens, who can not but be sensible of the true wisdomof encountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviatea future accumulation of burthens. But here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the transportationof public prints. There is no resource so firm for the Government of theUnited States as the affections of the people, guided by an enlightenedpolicy; and to this primary good nothing can conduce more than a faithfulrepresentation of public proceedings, diffused without restraint throughoutthe United States. An estimate of the appropriations necessary for the current serviceof the ensuing year and a statement of a purchase of arms and militarystores made during the recess will be presented to Congress. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: The several subjects to which I have now referred open a wide rangeto your deliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of ourcommon country. Permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude ofyour task. Without an unprejudiced coolness the welfare of the Governmentmay be hazarded; without harmony as far as consists with freedom of sentimentits dignity may be lost. But as the legislative proceedings of the UnitedStates will never, I trust, be reproached for the want of temper or ofcandor, so shall not the public happiness languish from the want of mystrenuous and warmest cooperation. \",\"president\":\"George Washington\",\"title\":\"December 3, 1793: Fifth Annual Message to Congress\"},{\"doc_name\":\"december-7-1796-eighth-annual-message-congress\",\"date\":\"1796-12-07\",\"transcript\":\" Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:         In     recurring to the internal situation of our Country, since I had last the pleasure     to Address you, I find ample reason for a renewed expression of that gratitude     to the ruler of the Universe, which a continued series of prosperity has so     often and so justly called forth.          The Acts of the last Session, which required special arrangements, have been,   as far as circumstances would admit, carried into operation.  Measures calculated to insure a continuance of the friendship of the Indians,   and to preserve peace along the extent of our interior frontier, have been digested   and adopted. In the framing of these, care has been taken to guard on the one   hand, our advanced Settlements from the predatory incursions of those unruly   Individuals, who cannot be restrained by their Tribes; and on the other hand,   to protect the rights secured to the Indians by Treaty; to draw them nearer   to the civilized state; and inspire them with correct conceptions of the Power,   as well as justice of the Government.  The meeting of the deputies from the Creek Nation at Colerain, in the State   of Georgia, which had for a principal object the purchase of a parcel of their   land, by that State, broke up without its being accomplished; the Nation having,   previous to their departure, instructed them against making any Sale; the occasion   however has been improved, to confirm by a new Treaty with the Creeks, their   pre-existing engagements with the United States; and to obtain their consent,   to the establishment of Trading Houses and Military Posts within their boundary;   by means of which, their friendship, and the general peace, may be more effectually   secured.  The period during the late Session, at which the appropriation was passed,   for carrying into effect the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, between   the United States and his Britannic Majesty, necessarily procrastinated the   reception of the Posts stipulated to be delivered, beyond the date assigned   for that event. As soon however as the Governor General of Canada could be addressed   with propriety on the subject, arrangements were cordially and promptly concluded   for their evacuation; and the United States took possession of the principal   of them, comprehending Oswego, Niagara, Detroit, Michelimackina, and Fort Miami;   where, such repairs, and additions have been ordered to be made, as appeared   indispensible.  The Commissioners appointed on the part of the United States and of Great   Britain, to determine which is the river St. Croix, mentioned in the Treaty   of peace of 1783, agreed in the choice of Egbert Benson Esqr. of New York, for   the third Commissioner. The whole met at St. Andrews, in Passamaquoddy Bay,   in the beginning of October; and directed surveys to be made of the Rivers in   dispute; but deeming it impracticable to have these Surveys completed before   the next Year, they adjourned, to meet at Boston in August 1797, for the final   decision of the question.  Other Commissioners appointed on the part of the United States, agreeably   to the seventh Article of the Treaty with Great Britain, relative to captures   and condemnations of Vessels and other property, met the Commissioners of his   Britannic Majesty in London, in August last, when John Trumbull, Esqr. was chosen   by lot, for the fifth Commissioner. In October following the Board were to proceed   to business. As yet there has been no communication of Commissioners on the   part of Great Britain, to unite with those who have been appointed on the part   of the United States, for carrying into effect the sixth Article of the Treaty.  The Treaty with Spain, required, that the Commissioners for running the boundary   line between the territory of the United States, and his Catholic Majesty's   Provinces of East and West Florida, should meet at the Natchez, before the expiration   of six Months after the exchange of the ratifications, which was effected at   Aranjuez on the 25th. day of April; and the troops of his Catholic Majesty occupying   any Posts within the limits of the United States, were within the same period   to be withdrawn. The Commissioner of the United States therefore, commenced   his journey for the Natchez in September; and troops were ordered to occupy   the Posts from which the Spanish Garrisons should be withdrawn. Information   has been recently received, of the appointment of a Commissioner on the part   of his Catholic Majesty for running the boundary line, but none of any appointment,   for the adjustment of the claims of our Citizens, whose Vessels were captured   by the Armed Vessels of Spain.  In pursuance of the Act of Congress, passed in the last Session, for the protection   and relief of American Seamen, Agents were appointed, one to reside in Great   Britain, and the other in the West Indies. The effects of the Agency in the   West Indies, are not yet fully ascertained; but those which have been communicated   afford grounds to believe, the measure will be beneficial. The Agent destined   to reside in Great Britain, declining to accept the appointment, the business   has consequently devolved on the Minister of the United States in London; and   will command his attention, until a new Agent shall be appointed.  After many delays and disappointments, arising out of the European War, the   final arrangements for fulfilling the engagements made to the Dey and Regency   of Algiers, will, in all present appearance, be crowned with success: but under   great, tho' inevitable disadvantages, in the pecuniary transactions, occasioned   by that War; which will render a further provision necessary. The actual liberation   of all our Citizens who were prisoners in Algiers, while it gratifies every   feeling heart, is itself an earnest of a satisfactory termination of the whole   negotiation. Measures are in operation for effecting Treaties with the Regencies   of Tunis and Tripoli.  To an active external Commerce, the protection of a Naval force is indispensable.   This is manifest with regard to Wars in which a State itself is a party. But   besides this, it is in our own experience, that the most sincere Neutrality   is not a sufficient guard against the depredations of Nations at War. To secure   respect to a Neutral Flag, requires a Naval force, organized, and ready to vindicate   it, from insult or aggression. This may even prevent the necessity of going   to War, by discouraging belligerent Powers from committing such violations of   the rights of the Neutral party, as may first or last, leave no other option.   From the best information I have been able to obtain, it would seem as if our   trade to the mediterranean, without a protecting force, will always be insecure;   and our Citizens exposed to the calamities from which numbers of them have but   just been relieved.  These considerations invite the United States, to look to the means, and to   set about the gradual creation of a Navy. The increasing progress of their Navigation,   promises them, at no distant period, the requisite supply of Seamen; and their   means, in other respects, favour the undertaking. It is an encouragement, likewise,   that their particular situation, will give weight and influence to a moderate   Naval force in their hands. Will it not then be adviseable, to begin without   delay, to provide, and lay up the materials for the building and equipping of   Ships of War; and to proceed in the Work by degrees, in proportion as our resources   shall render it practicable without inconvenience; so that a future War of Europe,   may not find our Commerce in the same unprotected state, in which it was found   by the present.  Congress have repeatedly, and not without success, directed their attention   to the encouragement of Manufactures. The object is of too much consequence,   not to insure a continuance of their efforts, in every way which shall appear   eligible. As a general rule, Manufactures on public account, are inexpedient.   But where the state of things in a Country, leaves little hope that certain   branches of Manufacture will, for a great length of time obtain; when these   are of a nature essential to the furnishing and equipping of the public force   in time of War, are not establishments for procuring them on public account,   to the extent of the ordinary demand for the public service, recommended by   strong considerations of National policy, as an exception to the general rule?   Ought our Country to remain in such cases, dependant on foreign supply, precarious,   because liable to be interrupted? If the necessary Articles should, in this   mode cost more in time of peace, will not the security and independence thence   arising, form an ample compensation? Establishments of this sort, commensurate   only with the calls of the public service in time of peace, will, in time of   War, easily be extended in proportion to the exigencies of the Government; and   may even perhaps be made to yield a surplus for the supply of our Citizens at   large; so as to mitigate the privations from the interruption of their trade.   If adopted, the plan ought to exclude all those branches which are already,   or likely soon to be, established in the Country; in order that there may be   no danger of interference with pursuits of individual industry.  It will not be doubted, that with reference either to individual, or National   Welfare, Agriculture is of primary importance. In proportion as Nations advance   in population, and other circumstances of maturity, this truth becomes more   apparent; and renders the cultivation of the Soil more and more, an object of   public patronage. Institutions for promoting it, grow up, supported by the public   purse: and to what object can it be dedicated with greater propriety? Among   the means which have been employed to this end, none have been attended with   greater success than the establishment of Boards, composed of proper characters,   charged with collecting and diffusing information, and enabled by premiums,   and small pecuniary aids, to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and   improvement. This species of establishment contributes doubly to the increase   of improvement; by stimulating to enterprise and experiment, and by drawing   to a common centre, the results everywhere of individual skill and observation;   and spreading them thence over the whole Nation. Experience accordingly has   shewn, that they are very cheap Instruments, of immense National benefits.  I have heretofore proposed to the consideration of Congress, the expediency   of establishing a National University; and also a Military Academy. The desirableness   of both these Institutions, has so constantly increased with every new view   I have taken of the subject, that I cannot omit the opportunity of once for   all, recalling your attention to them.  The Assembly to which I address myself, is too enlightened not to be fully   sensible how much a flourishing state of the Arts and Sciences, contributes   to National prosperity and reputation. True it is, that our Country, much to   its honor, contains many Seminaries of learning highly respectable and useful;   but the funds upon which they rest, are too narrow, to command the ablest Professors,   in the different departments of liberal knowledge, for the Institution contemplated,   though they would be excellent auxiliaries.  Amongst the motives to such an Institution, the assimilation of the principles,   opinions and manners of our Country men, but the common education of a portion   of our Youth from every quarter, well deserves attention. The more homogeneous   our Citizens can be made in these particulars, the greater will be our prospect   of permanent Union; and a primary object of such a National Institution should   be, the education of our Youth in the science of Government . In a Republic,   what species of knowledge can be equally important? and what duty, more pressing   on its Legislature, than to patronize a plan for communicating it to those,   who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the Country?  The Institution of a Military Academy, is also recommended by cogent reasons.   However pacific the general policy of a Nation may be, it ought never to be   without an adequate stock of Military knowledge for emergencies. The first would   impair the energy of its character, and both would hazard its safety, or expose   it to greater evils when War could not be avoided. Besides that War, might often,   not depend upon its own choice. In proportion, as the observance of pacific   maxims, might exempt a Nation from the necessity of practising the rules of   the Military Art, ought to be its care in preserving, and transmitting by proper   establishments, the knowledge of that Art. Whatever argument may be drawn from   particular examples, superficially viewed, a thorough examination of the subject   will evince, that the Art of War, is at once comprehensive and complicated;   that it demands much previous study; and that the possession of it, in its most   improved and perfect state, is always of great moment to the security of a Nation.   This, therefore, ought to be a serious care of every Government: and for this   purpose, an Academy, where a regular course of Instruction is given, is an obvious   expedient, which different Nations have successfully employed.  The compensations to the Officers of the United States, in various instances,   and in none more than in respect to the most important stations, appear to call   for Legislative revision. The consequences of a defective provision, are of   serious import to the Government. If private wealth, is to supply the defect   of public retribution, it will greatly contract the sphere within which, the   selection of Characters for Office, is to be made, and will proportionally diminish   the probability of a choice of Men, able, as well as upright: Besides that it   would be repugnant to the vital principles of our Government, virtually to exclude   from public trusts, talents and virtue, unless accompanied by wealth.  While in our external relations, some serious inconveniences and embarrassments   have been overcome, and others lessened, it is with much pain and deep regret   I mention, that circumstances of a very unwelcome nature, have lately occurred.   Our trade has suffered, and is suffering, extensive injuries in the West Indies,   from the Cruisers, and Agents of the French Republic; and communications have   been received from its Minister here, which indicate the danger of a further   disturbance of our Commerce, by its authority; and which are, in other respects,   far from agreeable.  It has been my constant, sincere, and earnest wish, in conformity with that   of our Nation, to maintain cordial harmony, and a perfectly friendly understanding   with that Republic. This wish remains unabated; and I shall persevere in the   endeavour to fulfil it, to the utmost extent of what shall be consistent with   a just, and indispensable regard to the rights and honour of our Country; nor   will I easily cease to cherish the expectation, that a spirit of justice, candour   and friendship, on the part of the Republic, will eventually ensure success.  In pursuing this course however, I cannot forget what is due to the character   of our Government and Nation; or to a full and entire confidence in the good   sense, patriotism, selfrespect, and fortitude of my Countrymen.  I reserve for a special Message a more particular communication on this interesting   subject.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I have directed an estimate of   the Appropriations, necessary for the service of the ensuing year, to be submitted   from the proper Department; with a view of the public receipts and expenditures,   to the latest period to which an account can be prepared.  It is with satisfaction I am able to inform you, that the Revenues of the   United States continue in a state of progressive improvement.  A reinforcement of the existing provisions for discharging our public Debt,   was mentioned in my Address at the opening of the last Session. Some preliminary   steps were taken towards it, the maturing of which will, no doubt, engage your   zealous attention during the present. I will only add, that it will afford me,   heart felt satisfaction, to concur in such further measures, as will ascertain   to our Country the prospect of a speedy extinguishment of the Debt. Posterity   may have cause to regret, if, from any motive, intervals of tranquillity are   left unimproved for accelerating this valuable end.  Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives: My solicitude   to see the Militia of the United States placed on an efficient establishment,   has been so often, and so ardently expressed, that I shall but barely recall   the subject to your view on the present occasion; at the same time that I shall   submit to your enquiry, whether our Harbours are yet sufficiently secured.  The situation in which I now stand, for the last time, in the midst of the   Representatives of the People of the United States, naturally recalls the period   when the Administration of the present form of Government commenced; and I cannot   omit the occasion, to congratulate you and my Country, on the success of the   experiment; nor to repeat my fervent supplications to the Supreme Ruler of the   Universe, and Sovereign Arbiter of Nations, that his Providential care may still   be extended to the United States; that the virtue and happiness of the People,   may be preserved; and that the Government, which they have instituted, for the   protection of their liberties, maybe perpetual. \",\"president\":\"George Washington\",\"title\":\"December 7, 1796: Eighth Annual Message to Congress\"},{\"doc_name\":\"december-8-1790-second-annual-message-congress\",\"date\":\"1790-12-08\",\"transcript\":\" Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: In   meeting you again I feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my congratulations   on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish our public Affairs.   The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our Country with plenty, and   with the means of a flourishing commerce. The progress of public credit is witnessed   by a considerable rise of American Stock abroad as well as at home. And the   revenues allotted for this and other national purposes, have been productive   beyond the calculations by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance   is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources,   but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and   credit; and let me add, as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism   and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our Citizens. The punctuality   of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary.  In conforming to the powers vested in me by acts of the last Session, a loan   of three millions of florins, towards which some provisional measures had previously   taken place, has been completed in Holland. As well the celerity with which   it has been filled, as the nature of the terms, (considering the more than ordinary   demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) gives a reasonable   hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and   success. The Secretary of the Treasury has my directions to communicate such   further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information.  Since your last Sessions, I have received communications by which it appears,   that the District of Kentucky, at present a part of Virginia, has concurred   in certain propositions contained in a law of that State; in consequence of   which the District is to become a distinct member of the Union, in case the   requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now   made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid   before you. The liberality and harmony, with which it has been conducted will   be found to do great honor to both the parties; and the sentiments of warm attachment   to the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow citizens of   Kentucky cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare   to the great national impressions under which you will decide on the case submitted   to you.  It has been heretofore known to Congress, that frequent incursions have been   made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the North   West side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the   Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being   emboldened by the impunity of their crimes, and aided by such parts of the neighboring   tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat   for their prisoners and plunder, they have, instead of listening to the humane   overtures92 made on the part of the United States, renewed their violences with   fresh alacrity and greater effect. The lives of a number of valuable Citizens   have thus been sacrificed, and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking;   whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.   These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the Western   Settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the Government   of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes, than it is disposed   to respect their rights and reward their attachments. As this object could not   be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the Act,   which empowers the President to call out the Militia for the protection of the   frontiers. And I have accordingly authorized an expedition in which the regular   troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of Militia as were deemed   sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me. The Secretary of   war is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it   is founded, as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended.  The disturbed situation of Europe, and particularly the critical posture of   the great maritime powers, whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the   general peace and security enjoyed by the United States, reminds us at the same   time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings.   It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even   of preparations for a war, among the Nations most concerned in active Commerce   with this Country, to abridge the means, and thereby at least enhance the price   of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend   it to your serious reflexion how far and in what mode, it may be expedient to   guard against embarrassments from these contingencies, by such encouragements   to our own Navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture less dependent   on foreign bottoms, which may fail us in the very moments most interesting to   both of these great objects. Our fisheries, and the transportation of our own   produce offer us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil.  Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade   which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering   the present state of it distressful to us, that you will not think any deliberations   misemployed, which may lead to its relief and protection.  The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a Judiciary System   have opened the doors of Justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider   in your wisdom, whether improvements in that system may yet be made; and particularly   whether a uniform process of execution on sentences issuing, from the federal   Courts be not desireable through all the states.  The patronage of our commerce, of our merchants and Seamen, has called for   the appointment of Consuls in foreign Countries. It seems expedient to regulate   by law the exercise of that Jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted   them, either by express Convention, or by a friendly indulgence in the places   of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty   has stipulated in certain cases, the aid of the national authority to his Consuls   established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations   into full effect.  The establishment of the Militia; of a mint; of Standards of weights and measures;   of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume   of course, and which are abundantly urged by their own importance.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: The sufficiency of the Revenues   you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated, leaves   no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects   for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me, moreover, to hope that   it will be a favorite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the   Interest of the debt funded, but, as far and as fast as [the] growing resources   of the Country will permit, to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation   you have made of the Western Lands explains your dispositions on this subject:   And I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along   with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt, the more salutary   will the measure be to every public interest, as well as the more satisfactory   to our Constituents.  Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives: In pursuing the various   and weighty business of the present Session I indulge the fullest persuasion   that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom, and animated by   the love of your Country. In whatever belongs to my duty, you shall have all   the cooperation which an undiminished zeal for its welfare can inspire. It will   be happy for us both, and our best reward, if by a successful administration   of our respective trusts we can make the established Government more and more   instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow Citizens, and more and more   the object of their attachment and confidence.\",\"president\":\"George Washington\",\"title\":\"December 8, 1790: Second Annual Message to Congress\"},{\"doc_name\":\"december-8-1795-seventh-annual-message-congress\",\"date\":\"1795-12-08\",\"transcript\":\"I trust I do not deceive myself when I indulge the persuasion that I have never met you at any period when more than at the present the situation of our public affairs has afforded just cause for mutual congratulation, and for inviting you to join with me in profound gratitude to the Author of all Good for the numerous and extraordinary blessings we enjoy.\\nThe termination of the long, expensive, and distressing war in which we have been engaged with certain Indians northwest of the Ohio is placed in the option of the United States by a treaty which the commander of our army has concluded provisionally with the hostile tribes in that region.\\nIn the adjustment of the terms the satisfaction of the Indians was deemed worthy no less of the policy than of the liberality of the United States as the necessary basis of durable tranquillity. the object, it is believed, has been fully attained. The articles agreed upon will immediately be laid before the Senate for their consideration.\\nThe Creek and Cherokee Indians, who alone of the Southern tribes had annoyed our frontiers, have lately confirmed their preexisting treaties with us, and were giving evidence of a sincere disposition to carry them into effect by the surrender of the prisoners and property they had taken. But we have to lament that the fair prospect in this quarter has been once more clouded by wanton murders, which some citizens of Georgia are represented to have recently perpetrated on hunting parties of the Creeks, which have again subjected that frontier to disquietude and danger, which will be productive of further expense, and may occasion more effusion of blood. Measures are pursuing to prevent or mitigate the usual consequences of such outrages, and with the hope of their succeeding at least to avert general hostility.\\nA letter from the Emperor of Morocco announces to me his recognition of our treaty made with his father, the late Emperor, and consequently the continuance of peace with that power. With peculiar satisfaction I add that information has been received from an agent deputed on our part to Algiers importing that the terms of the treaty with the Day and Regency of that country had been adjusted in such a manner as to authorize the expectation of a speedy peace and the resolution of our unfortunate fellow citizens from a grievous captivity.\\nThe latest advices from our envoy at the Court of Madrid give, moreover, the pleasing information that he had assurances of a speedy and satisfactory conclusion of his negotiation. While the event depending upon unadjusted particulars can not be regarded as ascertained, it is agreeable to cherish the expectation of an issue which, securing amicably very essential interests of the United States, will at the same time lay the foundation of lasting harmony with a power whose friendship we have uniformly and sincerely desired to cultivate.\\nThough not before officially disclosed to the House of Representatives, you, gentlemen, are all apprised that a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation has been negotiated with Great Britain, and that the Senate have advised and consented to its ratification upon a condition which excepts part of one article. Agreeably thereto, and to the best judgment I was able to form of the public interest after full and mature deliberation, I have added my sanction. The result on the part of His Britannic Majesty is unknown. When received, the subject will without delay be placed before Congress.\\nThis interesting summary of our affairs with regard to the foreign powers between whom and the United States controversies have subsisted, and with regard also to those of our Indian neighbors with whom we have been in a state of enmity or misunderstanding, opens a wide field for consoling and gratifying reflections. If by prudence and moderation on every side the extinguishment of all the causes of external discord which have heretofore menaced our tranquillity, on terms compatible with our national rights and honor, shall be the happy result, how firm and how precious a foundation will have been laid for accelerating, maturing, and establishing the prosperity of our country.\\nContemplating the internal situation as well as the external relations of the United States, we discover equal cause for contentment and satisfaction. While many of the nations of Europe, with their American dependencies, have been involved in a contest unusually bloody, exhausting, and calamitous, in which the evils of foreign war have been aggravated by domestic convulsion and insurrection; in which many of the arts most useful to society have been exposed to discouragement and decay; in which scarcity of subsistence has imbittered other sufferings; while even the anticipations of a return of the blessings of peace and repose are alloyed by the sense of heavy and accumulating burthens, which press upon all the departments of industry and threaten to clog the future springs of government, our favored country, happy in a striking contrast, has enjoyed tranquillity&mdash;a tranquillity the more satisfactory because maintained at the expense of no duty. Faithful to ourselves, we have violated no obligation to others.\\nOur agriculture, commerce, and manufactures prosper beyond former example, the molestations of our trade (to prevent a continuance of which, however, very pointed remonstrances have been made) being overbalanced by the aggregate benefits which it derives from a neutral position. Our population advances with a celerity which, exceeding the most sanguine calculations, proportionally augments our strength and resources, and guarantees our future security.\\nEvery part of the Union displays indications of rapid and various improvement; and with burthens so light as scarcely to be perceived, with resources fully adequate to our present exigencies, with governments founded on the genuine principles of rational liberty, and with mild and wholesome laws, is it too much to say that our country exhibits a spectacle of national happiness never surpassed, if ever before equaled?\\nPlaced in a situation every way so auspicious, motives of commanding force impel us, with sincere acknowledgment to Heaven and pure love to our country, to unite our efforts to preserve, prolong, and improve our immense advantages. To cooperate with you in this desirable work is a fervent and favorite wish of my heart.\\nIt is a valuable ingredient in the general estimate of our welfare that the part of our country which was lately the scene of disorder and insurrection now enjoys the blessings of quiet and order. The misled have abandoned their errors, and pay the respect to our Constitution and laws which is due from good citizens to the public authorities of the society. These circumstances have induced me to pardon generally the offenders here referred to, and to extend forgiveness to those who had been adjudged to capital punishment. For though I shall always think it a sacred duty to exercise with firmness and energy the constitutional powers with which I am vested, yet it appears to me no less consistent with the public good than it is with my personal feelings to mingle in the operations of Government every degree of moderation and tenderness which the national justice, dignity, and safety may permit.\\nGentlemen: Among the objects which will claim your attention in the course of the session, a review of our military establishment is not the least important. It is called for by the events which have changed, and may be expected still further to change, the relative situation of our frontiers. In this review you will doubtless allow due weight to the considerations that the questions between us and certain foreign powers are not yet finally adjusted, that the war in Europe is not yet terminated, and that our Western posts, when recovered, will demand provision for garrisoning and securing them. A statement of our present military force will be laid before you by the Department of War.\\nWith the review of our Army establishment is naturally connected that of the militia. It will merit inquiry what imperfections in the existing plan further experience may have unfolded. The subject is of so much moment in my estimation as to excite a constant solicitude that the consideration of it may be renewed until the greatest attainable perfection shall be accomplished. Time is wearing away some advantages for forwarding the object, while none better deserves the persevering attention of the public councils.\\nWhile we indulge the satisfaction which the actual condition of our Western borders so well authorizes, it is necessary that we should not lose sight of an important truth which continually receives new confirmations, namely, that the provisions heretofore made with a view to the protection of the Indians from the violences of the lawless part of our frontier inhabitants are insufficient. It is demonstrated that these violences can now be perpetrated with impunity, and it can need no argument to prove that unless the murdering of Indians can be restrained by bringing the murderers to condign punishment, all the exertions of the Government to prevent destructive retaliations by the Indians will prove fruitless and all our present agreeable prospects illusory. The frequent destruction of innocent women and children, who are chiefly the victims of retaliation, must continue to shock humanity, and an enormous expense to drain the Treasury of the Union.\\nTo enforce upon the Indians the observance of justice it is indispensable that there shall be competent means of rendering justice to them. If these means can be devised by the wisdom of Congress, and especially if there can be added an adequate provision for supplying the necessities of the Indians on reasonable terms (a measure the mention of which I the more readily repeat, as in all the conferences with them they urge it with solicitude), I should not hesitate to entertain a strong hope of rendering our tranquillity permanent. I add with pleasure that the probability even of their civilization is not diminished by the experiments which have been thus far made under the auspices of Government. The accomplishment of this work, if practicable, will reflect undecaying luster on our national character and administer the most grateful consolations that virtuous minds can know.\\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\\nThe state of our revenue, with the sums which have been borrowed and reimbursed pursuant to different acts of Congress, will be submitted from the proper Department, together with an estimate of the appropriations necessary to be made for the service of the ensuing year.\\nWhether measures may not be advisable to reinforce the provision of the redemption of the public debt will naturally engage your examination. Congress have demonstrated their sense to be, and it were superfluous to repeat mine, that whatsoever will tend to accelerate the honorable extinction of our public debt accords as much with the true interest of our country as with the general sense of our constituents.\\nGentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\\nThe statements which will be laid before you relative to the Mint will shew the situation of that institution and the necessity of some further legislative provisions for carrying the business of it more completely into effect, and for checking abuses which appear to be arising in particular quarters.\\nThe progress in providing materials for the frigates and in building them, the state of the fortifications of our harbors, the measures which have been pursued for obtaining proper sites for arsenals and for replenishing our magazines with military stores, and the steps which have been taken toward the execution of the law for opening a trade with the Indians will likewise be presented for the information of Congress.\\nTemperate discussion of the important subjects which may arise in the course of the session and mutual forbearance where there is a difference of opinion are too obvious and necessary for the peace, happiness, and welfare of our country to need any recommendation of mine.\",\"president\":\"George Washington\",\"title\":\"December 8, 1795: Seventh Annual Message to Congress\"},{\"doc_name\":\"january-8-1790-first-annual-message-congress\",\"date\":\"1790-01-08\",\"transcript\":\"Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: I    embrace with great satisfaction the opportunity which now presents itself, of    congratulating you on the present favourable prospects of our public affairs.    The recent accession of the important State of North Carolina to the Constitution    of the United States (of which official information has been received); the    rising credit and respectability of our Country; the general and increasing    good will towards the Government of the Union, and the concord, peace, and plenty,    with which we are blessed are circumstances auspicious in an eminent degree,    to our national prosperity.In resuming your consultations for the general good, you cannot but derive    encouragement from the reflection that the measures of the last Session have    been as satisfactory to your Constituents, as the novelty and difficulty of    the work allowed you to hope. Still further to realize their expectations and    to secure the blessings which a Gracious Providence has placed within our reach,    will in the course of the present important Session, call for the cool and deliberate    exertion of your patriotism, firmness and wisdom.Among the many interesting objects, which will engage your attention, that    of providing for the common defence will merit particular regard. To be prepared    for War is one of the most effectual means of perserving peace.A free people ought not only to be armed but disciplined; to which end a uniform    and well digested plan is requisite: And their safety and interest require,    that they should promote such manufactories, as tend to render them independent    on others for essential, particularly for military supplies.The proper establishment of the Troops, which may be deemed indispensable,    will be entitled to mature deliberation. In the arrangements, which may be    made respecting it, it will be of importance to conciliate the comfortable support    of the Officers and Soldiers with a due regard to oeconomy.There was reason to hope that the pacific measures adopted with regard to certain    hostile tribes of Indians would have relieved the Inhabitants of our Southern    and Western frontiers from their depredations. But you will perceive from the    information contained in the papers which I shall direct to be laid before you    (comprehending a communication from the Commonwealth of Virginia) that we ought    to be prepared to afford protection to those parts of the Union; and if necessary    to punish aggressors.The interests of the United States requires that our intercourse with other    nations should be facilitated, by such provisions as will enable me to fulfill    my duty in that respect, in the manner which circumstances may render most conducive    to the public good: And to this end that the compensations to be made to the    persons who may be employed, should according to the nature of their appointments,    be defined by law; and a competent fund designated for defraying the expenses    incident to the conduct of our foreign affairs.Various considerations also render it expedient, that the terms on which foreigners    may be admitted to the rights of Citizens should be speedily ascertained by    a uniform rule of naturalization.Uniformity in the Currency, Weights and Measures of the United States is an    object of great importance, and will I am persuaded be duly attended to.The advancement of Agriculture, Commerce and Manufactures by all proper means,    will not I trust need recommendation. But I cannot forbear intimating to you    the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as well to the introduction    of new and useful inventions from abroad, as to the exertions of skill and genius    in producing them at home; and of facilitating the intercourse between the distant    parts of our Country by a due attention to the Post-Office and Post-Roads.Nor am I less persuaded, that you will agree with me in opinion, that there    is nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the promotion of Science    and Literature. Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness.    In one in which the measures of Government receive their impression so immediately    from the sense of the Community as in ours it is proportionably essential. To    the security of a free Constitution it contributes in various ways: By convincing    those who are intrusted with the public administration, that every valuable    end of Government is best answered by the enlightened confidence of the people:    and by teaching the people themselves to know and to value their own rights;    to discern and provide against invasions of them; to distinguish between oppression    and the necessary exercise of lawful authority; between burthens proceeding    from a disregard to their convenience and those resulting from the inevitable    exigencies of Society; to discriminate the spirit of Liberty from that of licentiousness,    cherishing the first, avoiding the last, and uniting a speedy, but temperate    vigilance against encroachments, with an inviolable respect to the Laws.Whether this desirable object will be the best promoted by affording aids    to seminaries of learning already established, by the institution of a national    University, or by any other expedients, will be well worthy of a place in the    deliberations of the Legislature.\",\"president\":\"George Washington\",\"title\":\"January 8, 1790: First Annual Message to Congress\"},{\"doc_name\":\"july-10-1795-proclamation-pardons-western-pennsylvania\",\"date\":\"1795-07-10\",\"transcript\":\" Whereas the commissioners appointed by the President of the United   States to confer with the citizens in the western counties of Pennsylvania during   the late insurrection which prevailed therein, by their act and agreement bearing   date the 2d day of September last, in pursuance of the powers in them vested,   did promise and engage that if assurances of submission to the laws of the United   States should be bona fide given by the citizens resident in the fourth survey   of Pennsylvania, in the manner and within the time in the said act and agreement   specified, a general pardon should be granted on the 10th day of July then next   ensuing of all treasons and other indictable offenses against the United States   committed within the said survey before the 22d day of August last, excluding   therefrom, nevertheless, every person who should refuse or neglect to subscribe   such assurance and engagement in manner aforesaid, or who should after such   subscription violate the same, or will fully obstruct or attempt to obstruct   the execution of the acts for raising a revenue on distilled spirits and stills,   or be aiding or abetting therein; and  Whereas I have since thought proper to extend' the said pardon to all persons   guilty of the said treasons, misprisions of treasons, or otherwise concerned   in the late insurrection within the survey aforesaid who have not since been   indicted or convicted thereof, or of any other offense against the United States:  Therefore be it known that I, George Washington, President of the said United   States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free, and entire   pardon to all persons (excepting as is hereinafter excepted) of all treasons,   misprisions of treason, and other indictable offenses against the United States   committed within the fourth survey of Pennsylvania before the said 22d day of   August last past, excepting and excluding therefrom, nevertheless, every person   who refused or neglected to give and subscribe the said assurances in the manner   aforesaid (or having subscribed hath violated the same) and now standeth indicted   or convicted of any treason, misprision of treason, or other offense against   the said United States, hereby remitting and releasing unto all persons, except   as before excepted, all penalties incurred, or supposed to be incurred, for   or on account of the premises.\",\"president\":\"George Washington\",\"title\":\"July 10, 1795: Proclamation of Pardons in Western Pennsylvania\"},{\"doc_name\":\"march-30-1796-message-house-representatives-declining-submit\",\"date\":\"1796-03-30\",\"transcript\":\" Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:         With the utmost attention     I have considered your resolution of the 24th. instant, requesting me to lay     before your House, a copy of the instructions to the Minister of the United     States who negotiated the Treaty with the King of Great Britain, together with     the correspondence and other documents relative to that Treaty, excepting such     of the said papers as any existing negotiation may render improper to be disclosed.          In deliberating upon this subject, it was impossible for me to lose sight   of the principle which some have avowed in its discussion; or to avoid extending   my views to the consequences which must flow from the admission of that principle.  I trust that no part of my conduct has ever indicated a disposition to withhold   any information which the Constitution has enjoined upon the President as a   duty to give, or which could be required of him by either House of Congress   as a right; And with truth I affirm, that it has been, as it will continue to   be, while I have the honor to preside in the Government, my constant endeavour   to harmonize with the other branches thereof; so far as the trust delegated   to me by the People of the United States, and my sense of the obligation it   imposes to &quot;preserve, protect and defend the Constitution&quot; will permit.  The nature of foreign negotiations requires caution; and their success must   often depend on secrecy: and even when brought to a conclusion, a full disclosure   of all the measures, demands, or eventual concessions, which may have been proposed   or contemplated, would be extremely impolitic: for this might have a pernicious   influence on future negotiations; or produce immediate inconveniences, perhaps   danger and mischief, in relation to other powers. The necessity of such caution   and secrecy was one cogent reason for vesting the power of making Treaties in   the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, the principle on which   that body was formed confining it to a small number of Members.  To admit then a right in the House of Representatives to demand, and to have   as a matter of course, all the Papers respecting a negotiation with a foreign   power, would be to establish a dangerous precedent.  It does not occur that the inspection of the papers asked for, be relative   to any purpose under the cognizance of the House of Representatives, except   that of an impeachment, which the resolution has not expressed. I repeat, that   I have no disposition to withhold any information which the duty of my station   will permit, or the public good shall require to be disclosed: and in fact,   all the Papers affecting the negotiation with Great Britain were laid before   the Senate, when the Treaty itself was communicated for their consideration   and advice.  The course which the debate has taken, on the resolution of the House, leads   to some observations on the mode of making treaties under the Constitution of   the United States.  Having been a member of the General Convention, and knowing the principles   on which the Constitution was formed, I have ever entertained but one opinion   on this subject; and from the first establishment of the Government to this   moment, my conduct has exemplified that opinion, that the power of making treaties   is exclusively vested in the President, by and with the advice and consent of   the Senate, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur, and that every   treaty so made, and promulgated, thenceforward became the Law of the land. It   is thus that the treaty making power has been understood by foreign Nations:   and in all the treaties made with them, we have declared, and they have believed,   that when ratified by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate,   they became obligatory. In this construction of the Constitution every House   of Representatives has heretofore acquiesced; and until the present time, not   a doubt or suspicion has appeared to my knowledge that this construction was   not the true one. Nay, they have more than acquiesced: for till now, without   controverting the obligation of such treaties, they have made all the requisite   provisions for carrying them into effect.  There is also reason to believe that this construction agrees with the opinions   entertained by the State Conventions, when they were deliberating on the Constitution;   especially by those who objected to it, because there was not required, in commercial   treaties, the consent of two thirds of the whole number of the members of the   Senate, instead of two thirds of the Senators present; and because in treaties   respecting territorial and certain other rights and claims, the concurrence   of three fourths of the whole number of the members of both houses respectively,   was not made necessary.  It is a fact declared by the General Convention, and universally understood,   that the Constitution of the United States was the result of a spirit of amity   and mutual concession. And it is well known that under this influence the smaller   States were admitted to an equal representation in the Senate with the larger   States; and that this branch of the government was invested with great powers:   for on the equal participation of those powers, the sovereignty andpolitical   safety of the smaller States were deemed essentially to depend.  If other proofs than these, and the plain letter of the Constitution itself,   be necessary to ascertain the point under consideration, they may be found in   the journals of the General Convention, which I have deposited in the office   of the department of State. In these journals it will appear that a proposition   was made, &quot;that no Treaty should be binding on the United States which   was not ratified by a Law&quot;; and that the proposition was explicitly rejected.  As therefore it is perfectly clear to my understanding, that file assent of   the House of Representatives is not necessary to the validity of a treaty: as   the treaty with Great Britain exhibits in itself all the objects requiring legislative   provision; And on these the papers called for can throw no light: And as it   is essential to the due administration of the government, that the boundaries   fixed by the constitution between the different departments should be preserved:   A just regard to the Constitution and to the duty of my Office, under all the   circumstances of this case, forbids a complyance with your request.\",\"president\":\"George Washington\",\"title\":\"March 30, 1796: Message to the House of Representatives, Declining to Submit Diplomatic Instructions and Corresponde\"},{\"doc_name\":\"march-4-1793-second-inaugural-address\",\"date\":\"1793-03-04\",\"transcript\":\"Fellow-Citizens:\\n\\nI am again called upon by the voice of my Country to execute the functions of its Chief Magistrate.

It is due, however, to the character of our government, and to its stability,   which cannot be shaken by the enemies of order, freely to unfold the course   of this event.  During the session of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety, it was   expedient to exercise the legislative power, granted by the constitution of   the United States, &quot;to lay and collect excises.&quot; In a majority of   the States, scarcely an objection was heard to this mode of taxation. In some,   indeed, alarms were at first conceived, until they were banished by reason and   patriotism. In the four western counties of Pennsylvania, a prejudice, fostered   and embittered by the artifice of men, who labored for an ascendency over the   will of others, by the guidance of their passions, produced symptoms of riot   and violence. It is well known, that Congress did not hesitate to examine the   complaints which were presented, and to relieve them, as far as justice dictated,   or general convenience would permit, But the impression, which this moderation   made on the discontented, did not correspond, with what it deserved. The arts   of delusion were no longer confined to the efforts of designing individuals.  The very forbearance to press prosecutions was misinterpreted into a fear   of urging the execution of the laws; and associations of men began to denounce   threats against the officers employed. From a belief, that by a more formal   concert, their operation might be defeated, certain self-created societies 36   assumed the tone of condemnation. Hence, while the greater part of Pennsylvania   itself were conforming themselves to the acts of excise, a few counties were   resolved to frustrate them. It was now perceived, that every expectation from   the tenderness which had been hitherto pursued, was unavailing, and that further   delay could only create an opinion of impotency or irresolution in the government.   Legal process was, therefore, delivered to the marshal, against the rioters   and delinquent distillers.   No sooner was he understood to be engaged in this duty, than the vengeance of   armed men was aimed at his person, and the person and property of the inspector   of the revenue. They fired upon the marshal, arrested him, and detained him   for some time, as a prisoner. He was obliged, by the jeopardy of his life, to   renounce the service of other process, on the west side of the Allegeny mountain;   and a deputation was afterwards sent to him to demand a surrender of that which   he had served. A numerous body repeatedly attacked the house of the inspector,   seized his papers of office, and finally destroyed by fire, his buildings, and   whatsoever they contained. Both of these officers, from a just regard to their   safety, fled to the seat of government; it being avowed, that the motives to   such outrages were to compel the resignation of the inspector, to withstand   by force of arms the authority of the United States, and thereby to extort a   repeal of the laws of excise, and an alteration in the conduct of government.  Upon the testimony of these facts, an associate Justice of the Supreme Court   of the United States notified to me, that &quot;in the counties of Washington   and Allegeny, in Pennsylvania, laws of the United States were opposed, and the   execution thereof obstructed by combinations, too powerful to be suppressed   by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the   marshal of that district.&quot; On this call, momentous in the extreme, I sought   and weighed, what might best subdue the crisis. On the one hand, the judiciary   was pronounced to be stripped of its capacity to enforce the laws; crimes, which   reached the very existence of social order, were perpetrated without controul,   the friends of government were insulted, abused, and overawed into silence,   or an apparent acquiescence; and the yield to the treasonable fury of so small   a portion of the United States, would be to violate the fundamental principle   of our constitution, which enjoins that the will of the majority shall prevail.   On the other, to array citizen against citizen, to publish the dishonor of such   excesses, to encounter the expense, and other embarrassments of so distant an   expedition, were steps too delicate, too closely interwoven with many affecting   considerations, to be lightly adopted. I postponed, therefore, the summoning   of the militia immediately into the field. But I required them to be held in   readiness, that if my anxious endeavours to reclaim the deluded, and to convince   the malignant of their danger, should be fruitless, military force might be   prepared to act, before the season should be too far advanced.  My Proclamation of the 7th of August last was accordingly issued, and accompanied   by the appointment of Commissioners, who were charged to repair to the scene   of insurrection. They were authorized to confer with any bodies of men, or individuals.   They were instructed to be candid and explicit, in stating the sensations, which   had been excited in the Executive, and his earnest wish to avoid a resort to   coercion. To represent, however, that without submission, coercion must be the   resort; but to invite them, at the same time, to return to the demeanor of faithful   citizens, by such accommodations as lay within the sphere of the executive power.   Pardon, too, was tendered to them by the government of the United States, and   that of Pennsylvania, upon no other condition, than a satisfactory assurance   of obedience to the laws.  Although the report of the commissioners marks their firmness and abilities,   and must unite all virtuous men, by shewing, that the means of conciliation   have been exhausted, all of those who had committed or abetted the tumults,   did not subscribe the mild form, which was proposed, as the atonement; and the   indications of a peaceable temper were neither sufficiently general, nor conclusive,   to recommend or warrant, a further suspension of the march of the militia.  Thus, the painful alternative could not be discarded. I ordered the militia   to march, after once more admonishing the insurgents, in my proclamation of   the 25th of September last.  It was a task too difficult to ascertain with precision, the lowest degree   of force, competent to the quelling of the insurrection. From a respect, indeed,   to oeconomy, and the ease of my fellow citizens belonging to the militia, it   would have gratified me to accomplish such an estimate. My very reluctance to   ascribe too much importance to the opposition, had its extent been accurately   seen, would have been a decided inducement to the smallest efficient numbers.   In this uncertainty, therefore, I put in motion fifteen thousand men, as being   an army, which, according to all human calculation, would be prompt, and adequate   in every view; and might perhaps, by rendering resistance desperate, prevent   the effusion of blood. Quotas had been assigned to the states of New-Jersey,   Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia; the governor of Pennsylvania having declared   on this occasion, an opinion which justified a requisition to the other states.  As commander in chief of the militia, when called into the actual service   of the United States, I have visited the places of general rendezvous, to obtain   more exact information, and to direct a plan for ulterior movements. Had there   been room for a persuasion, that the laws were secure from obstruction; that   the civil magistrate was able to bring to justice such of the most culpable,   as have not embraced the proffered terms of amnesty, and may be deemed fit objects   of example; that the friends to peace and good government were not in need of   that aid and countenance, which they ought always to receive, and I trust, ever   will receive, against the vicious and turbulent; I should have caught with avidity   the opportunity of restoring the militia to their families and home. But succeeding   intelligence has tended to manifest the necessity of what has been done; it   being now confessed by those who were not inclined to exaggerate the ill-conduct   of the insurgents, that their malevolence was not pointed merely to a particular   law; but that a spirit, inimical to all order, has actuated many of the offenders.   If the state of things had afforded reason for the continuance of my presence   with the army, it would not have been withholden. But every appearance assuring   such an issue, as will redound to the reputation and strength of the United   States, I have judged it most proper, to resume my duties at the seat of government,   leaving the chief command with the governor of Virginia.  Still, however, as it is probable, that in a commotion like the present, whatsoever   may be the pretence, the purposes of mischief and revenge may not be laid aside;   the stationing of a small force for a certain period in the four western counties   of Pennsylvania will be indispensable; whether we contemplate the situation   of those, who are connected with the execution of the laws; or of others who   may have exposed themselves by an honorable attachment to them.  Thirty days from the commencement of this session, being the legal limitation   of the employment of the militia, Congress cannot be too early occupied with   this subject.  Among the discussions, which may arise from this aspect of our affairs, and   from the documents which will be submitted to Congress, it will not escape their   observation, that not only the inspector of the revenue, but other officers   of the United States in Pennsylvania have, from their fidelity in the discharge   of their functions, sustained material injuries to their property. The obligation   and policy of indemnifying them are strong and obvious. It may also merit attention,   whether policy will not enlarge this provision to the retribution of other citizens,   who, though not under the ties of office, may have suffered damage by their   generous exertions for upholding the constitution and the laws. The amount,   even if all the injured were included, would not be great; and on future emergencies,   the government would be amply repaid by the influence of an example, that he,   who incurs a loss in its defence shall find a recompense in its liberality.  While there is cause to lament, that occurrences of this nature should have   disgraced the name, or interrupted the tranquillity of any part of our community,   or should have diverted to a new application, any portion of the public resources,   there are not wanting real and substantial consolations for the misfortune.   It has demonstrated, that our prosperity rests on solid foundations; by furnishing   an additional proof, that my fellow citizens understand the true principles   of government and liberty: that they feel their inseparable union: that notwithstanding   all the devices which have been used to sway them from their interest and duty,   they are now as ready to maintain the authority of the laws against licentious   invasions, as they were to defend their rights against usurpation. It has been   a spectacle, displaying to the highest advantage, the value of Republican Government,   to behold the most and least wealthy of our citizens standing in the same ranks   as private soldiers; pre-eminently distinguished by being the army of the constitution;   undeterred by a march of three hundred miles over rugged mountains, by the approach   of an inclement season, or by any other discouragement. Nor ought I to omit   to acknowledge the efficacious and patriotic co-operation, which I have experienced   from the chief magistrates of the states, to which my requisitions have been   addressed.  To every description, indeed, of citizens let praise be given. But let them   persevere in their affectionate vigilance over that precious depository of American   happiness, the constitution of the United States. Let them cherish it too, for   the sake of those, who from every clime are daily seeking a dwelling in our   land. And when in the calm moments of reflection, they shall have retraced the   origin and progress of the insurrection, let them determine, whether it has   not been fomented by combinations of men, who, careless of consequences, and   disregarding the unerring truth, that those who rouse, cannot always appease   a civil convulsion, have disseminated, from an ignorance or version of facts,   suspicions, jealousies, and accusations of the whole government.  Having thus fulfilled the engagement, which I took, when I entered into office,   &quot;to the best of my ability to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution   of the United States,&quot; on you, Gentlemen, and the people by whom you are   deputed, I rely for support.  In the arrangements, to which the possibility of a similar contingency will   naturally draw your attention, it ought not to be forgotten, that the militia   laws have exhibited such striking defects, as could not have been supplied but   by the zeal of our citizens. Besides the extraordinary expense and waste, which   are not the least of the defects, every appeal to those laws is attended with   a doubt of its success.  The devising and establishing of a well regulated militia, would be a genuine   source of legislative honor, and a perfect title to public gratitude. I, therefore,   entertain a hope, that the present session will not pass, without carrying to   its full energy the power of organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia;   and thus providing, in the language of the constitution, for calling them forth   to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.  As auxiliary to the state of our defence, to which Congress can never too   frequently recur, they will not omit to enquire whether the fortifications,   which have been already licensed by law, be commensurate with our exigencies.  The intelligence from the army, under the command of general Wayne, is a happy   presage to our military operations against the hostile Indians north of the   Ohio. From the advices which have been forwarded, the advance which he has made   must have damped the ardor of the savages, and weakened their obstinacy in waging   war against the United States. And yet, even at this late hour, when our power   to punish them cannot be questioned, we shall not be unwilling to cement a lasting   peace, upon terms of candor, equity, and good neighborhood.  Towards none of the Indian tribes have overtures of friendship been spared.   The Creeks in particular are covered from encroachment by the interposition   of the General Government and that of Georgia. From a desire also to remove   the discontents of the Six Nations, a settlement, meditated at Presqu'isle on   Lake Erie, has been suspended; and an agent is now endeavoring to rectify any   misconception, into which they may have fallen. But I cannot refrain from again   pressing upon your deliberations, the plan which I recommended at the last session,   for the improvement of harmony with all the Indians within our limits, by the   fixing and conducting of trading houses, upon the principles then expressed.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: The time, which has elapsed, since   the commencement of our fiscal measures, has developed our pecuniary resources,   so as to open a way for a definitive plan for the redemption of the public debt.   It is believed, that the result is such, as to encourage Congress to consummate   this work, without delay. Nothing can more promote the permanent welfare of   the nation, and nothing would be more grateful to our constituents. Indeed whatsoever   is unfinished of our system of public credit, cannot be benefited by procrastination;   and as far as may be practicable, we ought to place that credit on grounds which   cannot be disturbed, and to prevent that progressive accumulation of debt which   must ultimately endanger all governments.  An estimate of the necessary appropriations, including the expenditures into   which we have been driven by the insurrection, will be submitted to Congress.  Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives: The mint of   the United States has entered upon the coinage of the precious metals; and considerable   sums of defective coins and bullion have been lodged with the director by individuals.   There is a pleasing prospect that the institution will, at no remote day, realize   the expectation which was originally formed of its utility.  In subsequent communications, certain circumstances of our intercourse with   foreign nations, will be transmitted to Congress. However, it may not be unseasonable   to announce that my policy in our foreign transactions has been, to cultivate   peace with all the world; to observe treaties with pure and absolute faith;   to check every deviation from the line of impartiality; to explain what may   have been misapprehended, and correct what may have been injurious to any nation;   and having thus acquired the right, to lose no time in acquiring the ability,   to insist upon justice being done to ourselves.  Let us unite, therefore, in imploring the Supreme Ruler of nations, to spread   his holy protection over these United States: to turn the machinations of the   wicked to the confirming of our constitution: to enable us at all times to root   out internal sedition, and put invasion to flight: to perpetuate to our country   that prosperity, which his goodness has already conferred, and to verify the   anticipations of this government being a safe guard to human rights.\",\"president\":\"George Washington\",\"title\":\"November 19, 1794: Sixth Annual Message to Congress\"},{\"doc_name\":\"november-6-1792-fourth-annual-message-congress\",\"date\":\"1792-11-06\",\"transcript\":\" Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives: It is some abatement of the satisfaction, with which I meet you on the present     occasion, that in felicitating you on a continuance of the National prosperity,     generally, I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hostilities,     which have for some time past distressed our North Western frontier, have terminated.  You will, I am persuaded, learn, with no less concern than I communicate it,   that reiterated endeavors, toward effecting a pacification, have hitherto issued   only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility, on the part of the   tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity   to the frontier; to stop the further effusion of blood; to arrest the progress   of expense; to forward the prevalent wish of the Nation, for peace, has led,   through various channels, to strenuous efforts, to accomplish these desirable   purposes: In making which efforts, I consulted less my own anticipations of   the event, or the scruples, which some considerations were calculated to inspire,   than the wish to find the object attainable; or if not attainable, to ascertain   unequivocally that such is the case.  A detail of the measures, which have been pursued, and of their consequences,   which will be laid before you, while it will confirm to you the want of success,   thus far, will, I trust, evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could   have been devised, have been employed. The issue of some of them, indeed, is   still depending; but a favourable one, though not to be despaired of, is not   promised by anything that has yet happened.  In the course of the attempts which have been made, some valuable citizens   have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly   respected even among savages, has been found, in this instance, insufficient   to protect from Massacre the emissaries of peace. It will, I presume, be duly   considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality   towards the families of the deceased.  It must add to your concern, to be informed, that besides the continuation   of hostile appearances among the tribes North of the Ohio, some threatening   symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it.  A part of the Cherokees, known by the name of Chickamagas, inhabitating five   Villages on the Tennesee River, have been long in the practice of committing   depredations on the neighbouring settlements.  It was hoped that the treaty of Holstin, made with the Cherokee nation in   July 1791, would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event   has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas, aided by some Banditti of another   tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities   upon the Citizens of the United States in that quarter. The information which   has been received on this subject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive   precautions only have been strictly enjoined and observed.  It is not understood that any breach of Treaty, or aggression whatsoever,   on the part of the United States, or their Citizens, is even alleged as a pretext   for the spirit of hostility in this quarter.  I have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made (pursuant   to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative   of a prosecution of the war, in the event of a failure of pacific overtures.   A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised, has been recruited,   though the number is still incomplete. And pains have been taken to discipline   and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed.   A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing   towards a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable   to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the   number of troops raised, and some other points which have been suggested, will   afford more precise information, as a guide to the legislative consultations;   and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional   stimulus to the recruiting service may not be adviseable.  In looking forward to the future expense of the operations, which may be found   inevitable, I derive consolation from the information I receive, that the product   of the revenues for the present year, is likely to supersede the necessity of   additional burthens on the community, for the service of the ensuing year. This,   however, will be better ascertained in the course of the Session; and it is   proper to add, that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition   of no material extension of the spirit of hostility.  I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending   to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy   to the laws throughout our interior frontier, and for restraining the commission   of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory.   To enable, by competent rewards, the employment of qualified and trusty persons   to reside among them, as agents, would also contribute to the preservation of   peace and good neighbourhood. If, in addition to these expedients, an eligible   plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes,   and for carrying on trade with them, upon a scale equal to their wants, and   under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion,   its influence in cementing their interests with our's could not but be considerable.  The prosperous state of our Revenue has been intimated. This would be still   more the case, were it not for the impediments, which in some places continue   to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United   States. These impediments have lessened, and are lessening in local extent,   and as applied to the community at large, the contentment with the law appears   to be progressive.  But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in   certain quarters, I judged a special interposition on my part, proper and adviseable;   and under this impression, have issued a proclamation, warning against all unlawful   combinations and proceedings, having for their object or tending to obstruct   the operation of the law in question, and announcing that all lawful ways and   means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors   thereof, and securing obedience thereto.  Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders: and Congress   may be assured, that nothing within Constitutional and legal limits, which may   depend on me, shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of   the laws. In fulfilling this trust, I shall count intirely upon the full cooperation   of the other departments of Government, and upon the zealous support of all   good Citizens.  I cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the subject   of a revision of the Judiciary System. A representation from the Judges of the   Supreme Court, which will be laid before you, points out some of the inconveniences   that are experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws, considerations   arise out of the structure of that System, which, in some cases, tend to relax   their efficacy. As connected with this subject, provisions to facilitate the   taking of bail upon processes out of the Courts of the United States, and supplementary   definition of Offences against the Constitution and laws of the Union, and of   the punishment for such Offences, will, it is presumed, be found worthy of particular   attention.  Observations on the value of peace with other Nations are unnecessary. It   would be wise, however, by timely provisions, to guard against those acts of   our own Citizens, which might tend to disturb it, and to put ourselves in a   condition to give that satisfaction to foreign Nations which we may sometimes   have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your consideration   the means of preventing those aggressions by our Citizens on the territory of   other nations, and other infractions of the law of Nations, which, furnishing   just subject of complaint, might endanger our peace with them. And in general,   the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented   to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose, which takes   place if not renewed, at the close of the present session.  In execution of the Authority given by the legislature, measures have been   taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our   mint; others have been employed at home. Provision has been made for the requisite   buildings, and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes   of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of   half-dismes; the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention   to them.  The regulation of foreign Coins in correspondency with the principles of our   national coinage, as being essential to their due operation, and to order in   our money concerns, will, I doubt not, be resumed and completed.  It is represented that some provisions in the law, which establishes the Post-Office,   operate, in experiment, against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts   of the Country. Should this, upon due inquiry, be found to be the case, a full   conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence   and information, will, I doubt not, lead to the application of a remedy. 15 [Note:On December 31 Lear wrote to the Postmaster General: &quot;In reply to   your letter of this date requesting me to inform you of the facts or representations   communicated to the President relative to newspapers, which led him to notice   them in his Speech at the opening of the present session of Congress; I have   the honor to inform you that it was represented to the President in such a way   as to place the fact beyond a doubt in his mind, that in consequence of the   rate of postage imposed on the transmission of Newspapers by the Post-office   Law, many persons in Virginia who had heretofore taken Newspapers from this   City, had declined receiving them any longer; and that many others declared   that they only continued to take them under a full persuasion that the rate   of postage would be reduced during the present Session of Congress, and that   if such reduction should not take place, they would desire the printers to stop   their papers.  &quot;In addition to these strong marks of disapprobation of the rate of postage   on newspapers given by individuals, he was informed that the public mind, so   far as it had been expressed in that quarter on the subject, appeared very anxious   that an alteration should take place in that part of the post office Law which   relates to the transmission of Newspapers.&quot;  This letter is entered in the &quot;Letter Book&quot; in the Washington Papers   . ] The adoption of a Constitution for the State of Kentucky has been notified   to me. The Legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from   an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the Nation to which it   relates, and conducive to the general Order.  It is proper likewise to inform you, that since my last communication on the   subject, and in further execution of the Acts severally making provision for   the public debt, and for the reduction thereof, three new loans have been effected,   each for three millions of Florins. One at Antwerp, at the annual interest of   four and one half per Cent, with an Allowance of four per Cent in lieu of all   charges; and the other two at Amsterdam, at the annual interest of four per   Cent, with an allowance of five and one half per Cent in one case, and of five   per Cent in the other in lieu of all charges. The rates of these loans, and   the circumstances under which they have been made, are confirmations of the   high state of our Credit abroad.  Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied, the   payment of the debts due to certain foreign Officers, according to the provision   made during the last Session, has been embraced.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I entertain a strong hope that   the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you   to enter upon a Systematic and effectual arrangement for the regular redemption   and discharge of the public debt, according to the right which has been reserved   served to the Government. No measure can be more desireable, whether viewed   with an eye to its intrinsic importance, or to the general sentiment and wish   of the Nation.  Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has   been made for the Bank of the United States, pursuant to the eleventh section   of the Act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations   in this particular, it is expected a valuable saving will be made.  Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year, and for such extraordinaries   as may require provision, will demand, and, I doubt not, will engage your early   attention.  Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: I content myself   with recalling your attention, generally, to such objects, not particularized   in my present, as have been suggested in my former communications to you.  Various temporary laws will expire during the present Session. Among these,   that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian Tribes, will merit   particular notice.  The results of your common deliberations, hitherto, will, I trust, be productive   of solid and durable advantages to our Constituents; such as, by conciliating   more and more their ultimate suffrage, will tend to strengthen and confirm their   attachment to that constitution of Government, upon which, under Divine Providence,   materially depend their Union, their safety and their happiness.  Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends, there is nothing   which can have a more powerful tendency, than the careful cultivation of harmony,   combined with a due regard to stability, in the public Councils. \",\"president\":\"George Washington\",\"title\":\"November 6, 1792: Fourth Annual Message to Congress\"},{\"doc_name\":\"october-25-1791-third-annual-message-congress\",\"date\":\"1791-10-25\",\"transcript\":\" I meet you, upon the present occasion, with the feelings which   are naturally inspired by a strong impression of the prosperous situation of   our common Country, and by a persuasion equally strong that the labours of the   present45 Session, which has just commenced, will, under the guidance of a spirit   no less prudent than patriotic, issue in measures, conducive to the stability   and increase of national prosperity.   Numerous as are the Providential blessings which demand our grateful acknowledgments;   the abundance with which another year has again rewarded the industry of the   husbandman is too important to escape recollection.  Your own observations, in your respective situations, will have satisfied   you of the progressive state of Agriculture, Manufactures, Commerce and Navigation:   In tracing their causes, you will have remarked, with particular pleasure, the   happy effects of that revival of confidence, public as well as private, to which   the Constitution and Laws of the United States have so eminently contributed:   And you will have observed, with no less interest, new and decisive proofs of   the increasing reputation and credit of the Nation. But you nevertheless, cannot   fail to derive satisfaction from the confirmation of these circumstances, which   will be disclosed, in the several official communications, that will be made   to you in the course of your deliberations.  The rapid subscriptions to the Bank of the United States, which completed   the sum allowed to be subscribed, in a single day, is among the striking and   pleasing evidences which present themselves, not only of confidence in the Government,   but of resource in the community.  In the interval of your recess due attention has been paid to the execution   of the different objects which were specially provided for by the laws and Resolutions   of the last Session.  Among the most important of these is the defence and security of the Western   Frontiers. To accomplish it on the most humane principles was a primary wish.  Accordingly, at the same time that treaties have been provisionally concluded,   and other proper means used to attach the wavering, and to confirm in their   friendship, the well-disposed tribes of Indians; effectual measures have been   adopted to make those of a hostile description sensible that a pacification   was desired upon terms of moderation and justice.  These measures having proved unsuccessful, it became necessary to convince   the refractory of the power of the United States to punish their depredations.   Offensive operations have therefore been directed; to be conducted however,   as consistently as possible with the dictates of humanity. Some of these have   been crowned with full success, and others are yet depending. The expeditions   which have been completed were carried on under the authority, and at the expense   of the United States by the Militia of Kentucke; whose enterprise, intripidity   and good conduct, are entitled to peculiar commendation.  Overtures of peace are still continued to the deluded Tribes, and considerable   numbers of individuals belonging to them, have lately renounced all further   opposition, removed from their former situations, and placed themselves under   the immediate protection of the United States.  It is sincerely to be desired that all need of coercion, in future, may cease;   and that an intimate intercourse may succeed; calculated to advance the happiness   of the Indians, and to attach them firmly to the United States.  In order to this it seems necessary: That they should experience the benefits   of an impartial administration 46 of justice. That the mode of alienating their   lands the main source of discontent and war, should be so defined and regulated,   as to obviate imposition, and, as far as may be practicable, controversy concerning   the reality, and extent of the alienations which are made. That commerce with   them should be promoted under regulations tending to secure an equitable deportment   towards them, and that such rational experiments should be made, for imparting   to them the blessings of civilization, as may, from time to time suit their   condition. That the Executive of the United States should be enabled to employ   the means to which the Indians have been long accustomed for uniting their immediate   Interests with the preservation of Peace. And that efficatious provision should   be made for inflicting adequate penalties upon all those who, by violating their   rights, shall infringe the Treaties, and endanger the peace of the Union.   A System corrisponding with the mild principles of Religion and Philanthropy   towards an unenlightened race of Men, whose happiness materially depends on   the conduct of the United States, would be as honorable to the national character   as conformable to the dictates of sound policy.  The powers specially vested in me by the Act laying certain duties on distilled   spirits, which respect the subdivisions of the districts into Surveys, the appointment   of Officers, and the assignment of compensations, have likewise been carried   into effect. In a matter in which both materials and experience were wanting   to guide the calculation, it will be readily conceived that there must have   been difficulty in such an adjustment of the rates of compensation as would   conciliate a reasonable competency with a proper regard to the limits prescribed   by the law. It is hoped that the circumspection, which has been used will be   found in the result to have secured the last of the two objects; but it is probable,   that with a view to the first, in some instances, a revision of the provision   will be found adviseable.  The impressions with which this law has been received by the community, have   been, upon the whole, such as were to be expected among enlightened and well-disposed   Citizens, from the propriety and necessity of the measure. The novelty, however   of the tax, in a considerable part of the United States, and a misconception   of some of its provisions, have given occasion, in particular places to some   degree of discontent. But it is satisfactory to know that this disposition yields   to proper explanations and more just apprehensions of the true nature of the   law. and I entertain a full confidence, that it will, in all, give way to motives   which arise out of a just sense of duty, and a virtuous regard to the public   welfare.  If there are any circumstances, in the law, which consistently with its main   design, may be so varied as to remove any well intentioned objections, that   may happen to exist, it will consist with a wise moderation to make the proper   variations. It is desirable on all occasions, to unite with a steady and firm   adherence to constitutional and necessary Acts of Government, the fullest evidence   of a disposition, as far as may be practicable, to consult the wishes of every   part of the Community, and to lay the foundations of the public administration   in the affection 47 of the people.   Pursuant to the authority contained in the several Acts on that subject, a district   of ten miles square for the permanent seat of the Government of the United States   has been fixed, and announced by proclamation; which district will comprehend   lands on both sides of the River Potomack, and the towns of Alexandria and George   Town. A City has also been laid out agreeably to a plan which will be placed   before Congress: And as there is a prospect, favoured by the rate of sales which   have already taken place, of ample funds for carrying on the necessary public   buildings, there is every expectation of their due progress.  The completion of the Census of the Inhabitants, for which provision was made   by law, has been duly notified (excepting in one instance in which the return   has been informal, and another in which it has been omitted or miscarried) and   the returns of the Officers, who were charged with this duty, which will be   laid before you, will give you the pleasing assurance that the present population   of the United States borders on four Millions of persons.  It is proper also to inform you that a further loan of two millions and a   half of Florins has been completed in Holland; the terms of which are similar   to those of the one last announced, except as to a small reduction of charges.   Another on like terms, for six Millions of Florins, had been set on foot under   circumstances that assured immediate completion.  Gentlemen of the Senate:  Two treaties, which have been provisionally concluded with the Cherokees and   Six Nations of Indians, will be laid before you for your consideration and ratification.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:  In entering upon the discharge of your legislative trust, you must anticipate   with pleasure, that many of the difficulties, necessarily incident to the first   arrangements of a new Government, for an extensive Country, have been happily   surmounted by the zealous, and judicious exertions of your predecessors, in   co-operation with the other branch of the legislature. The important objects,   which remain to be accomplished, will, I am persuaded, be conducted upon principles   equally comprehensive, and equally well calculated for the advancement of the   general weal.  The time limited for receiving subscriptions to the loans proposed by the   Act making provision for the debt of the United States having expired, statements   from the proper department will, as soon as possible, apprize you of the exact   result. Enough, however is already known, to afford an assurance that the views   of that Act have been substantially fulfilled. The subscription in the domestic   debt of the United States, has embraced by far the greatest proportion of that   debt; affording at the same time proof of the general satisfaction of the public   Creditors with the System which has been proposed to their acceptance, and of   the spirit of accommodation to the convenience of the Government with which   they are actuated. The subscriptions in the debts of the respective States,   as far as the provisions of the law have permitted, may be said to be yet more   general. The part of the debt of the United States, which remains unsubscribed,   will naturally engage your further deliberations.  It is particularly pleasing to me to be able to announce to you, that the   revenues which have been established, promise to be adequate to their objects;   and may be permitted, if no unforeseen exigency occurs, to supercede, for the   present, the necessity of any new burthens upon our Constituents.  An Object which will claim your early attention, is, a provision for the current   service of the ensuing year, together with such ascertained demands upon the   Treasury as require to be immediately discharged; and such casualties as may   have arisen in the execution of the public business, for which no specific appropriations   may have yet been made; of all which a proper estimate will be laid before you.  Gentlement of the Senate,   and of the House of Representatives:  I shall content myself with a general reference to former communications for   several objects, upon which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto postponed   any definite resolution. Their importance will recall them to your attention;   and I trust that the progress already made in the most arduous arrangements   of the Government, will afford you leisure to resume them with advantage.  There are, however, some of them of which I cannot forbear a more particular   mention. These are, the Militia; the Post-Office and Post-roads; the Mint; Weights   and Measures; a provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States.  The first is certainly an object of primary importance, whether viewed in   reference to the national security, to the satisfaction of the community, or   to the preservation of order. In connection with this, the establishment of   competent Magazines and Arsenals, and the fortification of such places as are   peculiarly important and vulnerable, naturally present themselves to consideration.   The safety of the United States, under Divine protection, ought to rest on the   basis of systematic and solid arrangements; exposed as little as possible to   the hazard of fortuitous circumstances.  The importance of the Post-Office and Post-Roads, on a plan sufficiently liberal   and comprehensive, as they respect the expedition, safety and facility of communication,   is increased by the instrumentality in diffusing a knowledge of the laws and   proceedings of the government; which, while it contributes to the security of   the people, serves also to guard them against the effects of misrepresentation   and misconception. The establishment of additional cross-posts, especially to   some of the important points in the Western and Northern parts of the Union,   cannot fail to be of material Utility.  The disorders in the existing currency, and especially the scarcity of small   change, a scarcity so peculiarly distressing to the poorer classes, strongly   recommend the carrying into immediate effect the resolution already entered   into concerning the establishment of a Mint. Measures have been taken, pursuant   to that Resolution, for procuring some of the most necessary Artists, together   with the requisite Apparatus.  An uniformity in the weights and measures of the Country is among the important   objects submitted to you by the Constitution, and if it can be derived from   a standard at once invariable and universal, must be no less honorable to the   public Councils than conducive to the public convenience.  A provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States is particularly   urged, among other reasons, by the important considerations that they are pledged   as a fund for reimbursing the public debt; that if timely and judiciously applied,   they may save the necessity of burthening our citizens with new taxes for the   extinguishment of the principal; and that being free to discharge the principal   but in a limited proportion no opportunity ought to be lost for availing the   public of its right.\",\"president\":\"George Washington\",\"title\":\"October 25, 1791: Third Annual Message to Congress\"},{\"doc_name\":\"october-3-1789-thanksgiving-proclamation\",\"date\":\"1789-10-03\",\"transcript\":\"Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence    of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly    to implore his protection and favor, and Whereas both Houses of Congress have    by their joint Committee requested me \\\"to recommend to the People of    the United States a day of public thanks-giving and prayer to be observed by    acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God, especially    by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government    for their safety and happiness.\\\"Now therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th day of November next    to be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and    glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that    is, or that will be.

I constantly hoped that it would have been much earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at liberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this previous to the last election had even led to the preparation of an address to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations and the unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence impelled me to abandon the idea. I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as internal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible with the sentiment of duty or propriety, and am persuaded, whatever partiality may be retained for my services, that in the present circumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination to retire.\\n\\nThe impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were explained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust I will only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed toward the organization and administration of the Government the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable, Not unconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, has strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and every day the increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my services they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not forbid it.\\n\\nIn looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the career of my political life my feelings do not permit me to suspend the deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me; still more for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me, and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as an instructive example in our annals that under circumstances in which the passions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mislead; amidst appearances sometimes dubious; vicissitudes of fortune often discouraging; in situations in which not unfrequently want of success has countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support was the essential prop of the efforts and a guaranty of the plans by which they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall carry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free Constitution which is the work of your hands may be sacredly maintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of these States, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the affection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\\n\\nHere, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare which can not end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger natural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to offer to your solemn contemplation and to recommend to your frequent review some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you with the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive to bias his counsel. Nor can I forget as an encouragement to it your indulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar occasion.\\n\\nInterwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment.\\n\\nThe unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now dear to you. It is justly so, for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence, the support of your tranquillity at home, your peace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty which you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth, as this is the point in your political fortress against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.\\n\\nFor this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens by birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a common cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and liberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts, of common dangers, sufferings, and successes.\\n\\nBut these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves to your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more immediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds the most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the union of the whole.\\n\\nThe North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected by the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of the latter great additional resources of maritime and commercial enterprise and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The South, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the North, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its particular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes in different ways to nourish and increase the general mass of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like intercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive improvement of interior communications by land and water will more and more find, a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies requisite to its growth and comfort, and what is perhaps of still greater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, directed by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any other tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, whether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically precarious.\\n\\nWhile, then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular interest in union, all the parts combined can not fail to find in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater resource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations, and what is of inestimable value, they must derive from union an exemption from those broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict neighboring countries not tied together by the same governments, which their own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which opposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate and imbitter. Hence, likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military establishments which, under any form of government, are inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is that your union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the other.\\n\\nThese considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the union as a primary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common government can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To listen to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are authorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the auxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will afford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and full experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union affecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have demonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its bands.\\n\\nIn contemplating the causes which may disturb our union it occurs as matter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished for characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--Northern and Southern, Atlantic and Western-- whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts. You can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our Western country have lately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen in the negotiation by the Executive and in the unanimous ratification by the Senate of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at that event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded were the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the General Government and in the Atlantic States unfriendly to their interests in regard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of two treaties that with Great Britain and that with Spain--which secure to them everything they could desire in respect to our foreign relations toward confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the union by which they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers, if such there are, who would sever them from their brethren and connect them with aliens?\\n\\nTo the efficacy and permanency of your union a government for the whole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts can be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have experienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your first essay by the adoption of a Constitution of Government better calculated than your former for an intimate union and for the efficacious management of your common concerns. This Government, the offspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full investigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with energy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, has a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government. But the constitution which at any time exists till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established government.\\n\\nAll obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community, and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to snake the public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans, digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests.\\n\\nHowever combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things to become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying. afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\\n\\nToward the preservation of your Government and the permanency of your present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily discountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority, but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles, however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be to effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will impair the energy of the system, and thus to undermine what can not be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of governments as of other human institutions; that experience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of the existing constitution of a country; that facility in changes upon the credit of mere hypothesis and opinion exposes to perpetual change, from the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion; and remember especially that for the efficient management of your common interests in a country so extensive as ours a government of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable. Liberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly distributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed, little else than a name where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction, to confine each member of the society within the limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\\n\\nI have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the State, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.\\n\\nThis spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.\\n\\nThe alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual, and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.\\n\\nWithout looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\\n\\nIt serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-rounded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another; foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passion. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.\\n\\nThere is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks upon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in governments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose; and there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume.\\n\\nIt is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those intrusted with its administration to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just estimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into different depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the public weal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them. If in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this in one instance may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield.\\n\\nOf all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness--these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked, Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.\\n\\nIt is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric? Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions &#39;for the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened.\\n\\nAs a very important source of strength and security, cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as possible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but remembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding likewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of expense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars have occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burthen which we ourselves ought to bear. The execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives; but it is necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty it is essential that you should practically bear in mind that toward the payment of debts there must be revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that thee intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties), ought to be a decisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the Government in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the measures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.\\n\\nObserve good faith and justice toward all nations. Cultivate peace and harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct. And can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened, and at no distant period a great nation to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can doubt that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan would richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a steady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at least, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\\n\\nIn the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and passionate attachments for others should be excluded, and that in place of them just and amicable feelings toward all should be cultivated. The nation which indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur.\\n\\nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. The nation prompted by ill will and resentment sometimes impels to war the government contrary to the best calculations of policy. The government sometimes participates in the national propensity, and adopts through passion what reason would reject. At other times it makes the animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility, instigated by pride, ambition, and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.\\n\\nSo, likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification. It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained, and by exciting jealousy, ill will, and a disposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld; and it gives to ambitions, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country without odium, sometimes even with popularity, gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good the base or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.\\n\\nAs avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, to influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small or weak toward a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the satellite of the latter. Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence ( I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy, to be useful, must be impartial, else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense against it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their interests.\\n\\nThe great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in extending our commercial relations to have with them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us stop.\\n\\nEurope has a set of primary interests which to us have none or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.\\n\\nOur detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course. If we remain one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall counsel.\\n\\nWhy forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\\n\\nIt is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world, so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs that honesty is always. the best policy. I repeat, therefore, let those engagements be unwise to extend them.\\n\\nTaking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments on a respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies.\\n\\nHarmony, liberal intercourse with all nations are recommended by policy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand, neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of things; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce, but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in order to give trade a stable course, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the Government to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but temporary and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as experience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view that it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from another; that it must pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it may accept under that character; that by such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for nominal favors, and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.\\n\\nIn offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and affectionate friend I dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual current of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course which has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even flatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, some occasional good--that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism-- this hope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by which they have been dictated.\\n\\nHow far in the discharge of my official duties I have been guided by the principles which have been delineated the public records and other evidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To myself, the assurance of my own conscience is that I have at least believed myself to be guided by them.\\n\\nIn relation to the still subsisting war in Europe my proclamation of the 22d of April, 1793, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice and by that of your representatives in both Houses of Congress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, uninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\\n\\nAfter deliberate examination, with the aid of the best lights I could obtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the circumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and interest to take, a neutral position. Having taken it, I determined as far as should depend upon me to maintain it with moderation, perseverance, and firmness.\\n\\nThe considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is not necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, according to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from being denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually admitted by all.\\n\\nThe duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without anything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on every nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity toward other nations.\\n\\nThe inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be referred to your own reflections and experience. With me a predominant motive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and mature its yet recent institutions, and to progress without interruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.\\n\\nThough in reviewing the incidents of my Administration I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence, and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\\n\\nRelying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by that fervent love toward it which is so natural to a man who views in it the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several generations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of partaking in the midst of my fellow-citizens the benign influence of good laws under a free government--the ever-favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers.\",\"president\":\"George Washington\",\"title\":\"September 19, 1796: Farewell Address\"},{\"doc_name\":\"september-25-1794-proclamation-militia-service\",\"date\":\"1794-09-25\",\"transcript\":\" Whereas, from a hope that the combinations against the Constitution   and laws of the United States, in certain of the Western counties of Pennsylvania,   would yield to time and reflection, I thought it sufficient, in the first instance,   rather to take measures for calling forth the militia than immediately to embody   them; but the moment is now come, when the overtures of forgiveness, with no   other condition than a submission to law, have been only partially accepted;   when every form of conciliation not inconsistent with the being of Government   has been adopted, without effect; when the well-disposed in those counties are   unable by their influence and example to reclaim the wicked from their fury,   and are compelled to associate in their own defence; when the proffered lenity   has been perversely misinterpreted into an apprehension that the citizens will   march with reluctance; when the opportunity of examining the serious consequences   of a treasonable opposition has been employed in propagating principles of anarchy,   endeavoring through emissaries to alienate the friends of order from its support,   and inviting enemies to perpetrate similar acts of insurrection; when it is   manifest, that violence would continue to be exercised upon every attempt to   enforce the laws; when, therefore, Government is set at defiance, the contest   being whether a small proportion of the United States shall dictate to the whole   Union, and, at the expense of those who desire peace, indulge a desperate ambition;  Now, therefore, I, George Washington, President of the United States, in obedience   to that high and irresistible duty, consigned to me by the Constitution, &quot;to   take care that the laws be faithfully executed;&quot; deploring that the American   name should be sullied by the outrages of citizens on their: own Government;   commiserating such as remain obstinate from delusion; but resolved, in perfect   reliance on that gracious Providence which so signally displays its goodness   towards this country, to reduce the refractory to a due subordination to the   laws; do hereby declare and make known, that, with a satisfaction which can   be equalled only by the merits of the militia summoned into service from the   States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, I have received   intelligence of their patriotic alacrity, in obeying the call of the present,   though painful, yet commanding necessity; that a force, which, according to   every reasonable expectation, is adequate to the exigency, is already in motion   to the scene of disaffection; that those who have confided or shall confide   in the protection of Government, shall meet full succor under the standard and   from the arms of the United States; that those who having offended against the   laws have since entitled themselves to indemnity, will be treated with the most   liberal good faith, if they shall not have forfeited their claim by any subsequent   conduct, and that instructions are given accordingly.  And I do, moreover, exhort all individuals, officers, and bodies of men, to   contemplate with abhorrence the measures leading directly or indirectly to those   crimes, which produce this resort to military coercion; to check, in their respective   spheres, the efforts of misguided or designing men to substitute their misrepresentation   in the place of truth, and their discontents in the place of stable government;   and to call to mind, that as the people of the United States have been permitted,   under the Divine favor, in perfect freedom, after solemn deliberation, in an   enlightened age, to elect their own Government, so will their gratitude for   this inestimable blessing be best distinguished by firm exertions to maintain   the Constitution and the laws.

            "    \"Text\" : \"Mr. President and fellow citizens of New York: The facts with which I shall deal this evening are mainly old and familiar; nor is there anything new in the general use I shall make of them. If there shall be any novelty, it will be in the mode of presenting the facts, and the inferences and observations following that presentation. In his speech last autumn, at Columbus, Ohio, as reported in \\\"The New-York Times,\\\" Senator Douglas said: \\\"Our fathers, when they framed the Government under which we live, understood this question just as well, and even better, than we do now.\\\" I fully indorse this, and I adopt it as a text for this discourse. I so adopt it because it furnishes a precise and an agreed starting point for a discussion between Republicans and that wing of the Democracy headed by Senator Douglas. It simply leaves the inquiry: \\\"What was the understanding those fathers had of the question mentioned?\\\" What is the frame of government under which we live? The answer must be: \\\"The Constitution of the United States.\\\" That Constitution consists of the original, framed in 1787, (and under which the present government first went into operation,) and twelve subsequently framed amendments, the first ten of which were framed in 1789. Who were our fathers that framed the Constitution? I suppose the \\\"thirty-nine\\\" who signed the original instrument may be fairly called our fathers who framed that part of the present Government. It is almost exactly true to say they framed it, and it is altogether true to say they fairly represented the opinion and sentiment of the whole nation at that time. Their names, being familiar to nearly all, and accessible to quite all, need not now be repeated. I take these \\\"thirty-nine,\\\" for the present, as being \\\"our fathers who framed the Government under which we live.\\\" What is the question which, according to the text, those fathers understood \\\"just as well, and even better than we do now?\\\" It is this: Does the proper division of local from federal authority, or anything in the Constitution, forbid our Federal Government to control as to slavery in our Federal Territories? Upon this, Senator Douglas holds the affirmative, and Republicans the negative. This affirmation and denial form an issue; and this issue - this question - is precisely what the text declares our fathers understood \\\"better than we.\\\" Let us now inquire whether the \\\"thirty-nine,\\\" or any of them, ever acted upon this question; and if they did, how they acted upon it - how they expressed that better understanding? In 1784, three years before the Constitution - the United States then owning the Northwestern Territory, and no other, the Congress of the Confederation had before them the question of prohibiting slavery in that Territory; and four of the \\\"thirty-nine\\\" who afterward framed the Constitution, were in that Congress, and voted on that question. Of these, Roger Sherman, Thomas Mifflin, and Hugh Williamson voted for the prohibition, thus showing that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from federal authority, nor anything else, properly forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in federal territory. The other of the four - James M'Henry - voted against the prohibition, showing that, for some cause, he thought it improper to vote for it. In 1787, still before the Constitution, but while the Convention was in session framing it, and while the Northwestern Territory still was the only territory owned by the United States, the same question of prohibiting slavery in the territory again came before the Congress of the Confederation; and two more of the \\\"thirty-nine\\\" who afterward signed the Constitution, were in that Congress, and voted on the question. They were William Blount and William Few; and they both voted for the prohibition - thus showing that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from federal authority, nor anything else, properly forbids the Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory. This time the prohibition became a law, being part of what is now well known as the Ordinance of '87. The question of federal control of slavery in the territories, seems not to have been directly before the Convention which framed the original Constitution; and hence it is not recorded that the \\\"thirty-nine,\\\" or any of them, while engaged on that instrument, expressed any opinion on that precise question. In 1789, by the first Congress which sat under the Constitution, an act was passed to enforce the Ordinance of '87, including the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory. The bill for this act was reported by one of the \\\"thirty-nine,\\\" Thomas Fitzsimmons, then a member of the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania. It went through all its stages without a word of opposition, and finally passed both branches without yeas and nays, which is equivalent to a unanimous passage. In this Congress there were sixteen of the thirty-nine fathers who framed the original Constitution. They were John Langdon, Nicholas Gilman, Wm. S. Johnson, Roger Sherman, Robert Morris, Thos. Fitzsimmons, William Few, Abraham Baldwin, Rufus King, William Paterson, George Clymer, Richard Bassett, George Read, Pierce Butler, Daniel Carroll, James Madison. This shows that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, properly forbade Congress to prohibit slavery in the federal territory; else both their fidelity to correct principle, and their oath to support the Constitution, would have constrained them to oppose the prohibition. Again, George Washington, another of the \\\"thirty-nine,\\\" was then President of the United States, and, as such approved and signed the bill; thus completing its validity as a law, and thus showing that, in his understanding, no line dividing local from federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government, to control as to slavery in federal territory. No great while after the adoption of the original Constitution, North Carolina ceded to the Federal Government the country now constituting the State of Tennessee; and a few years later Georgia ceded that which now constitutes the States of Mississippi and Alabama. In both deeds of cession it was made a condition by the ceding States that the Federal Government should not prohibit slavery in the ceded territory. Besides this, slavery was then actually in the ceded country. Under these circumstances, Congress, on taking charge of these countries, did not absolutely prohibit slavery within them. But they did interfere with it - take control of it - even there, to a certain extent. In 1798, Congress organized the Territory of Mississippi. In the act of organization, they prohibited the bringing of slaves into the Territory, from any place without the United States, by fine, and giving freedom to slaves so bought. This act passed both branches of Congress without yeas and nays. In that Congress were three of the \\\"thirty-nine\\\" who framed the original Constitution. They were John Langdon, George Read and Abraham Baldwin. They all, probably, voted for it. Certainly they would have placed their opposition to it upon record, if, in their understanding, any line dividing local from federal authority, or anything in the Constitution, properly forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in federal territory. In 1803, the Federal Government purchased the Louisiana country. Our former territorial acquisitions came from certain of our own States; but this Louisiana country was acquired from a foreign nation. In 1804, Congress gave a territorial organization to that part of it which now constitutes the State of Louisiana. New Orleans, lying within that part, was an old and comparatively large city. There were other considerable towns and settlements, and slavery was extensively and thoroughly intermingled with the people. Congress did not, in the Territorial Act, prohibit slavery; but they did interfere with it - take control of it - in a more marked and extensive way than they did in the case of Mississippi. The substance of the provision therein made, in relation to slaves, was: First. That no slave should be imported into the territory from foreign parts. Second. That no slave should be carried into it who had been imported into the United States since the first day of May, 1798. Third. That no slave should be carried into it, except by the owner, and for his own use as a settler; the penalty in all the cases being a fine upon the violator of the law, and freedom to the slave. This act also was passed without yeas and nays. In the Congress which passed it, there were two of the \\\"thirty-nine.\\\" They were Abraham Baldwin and Jonathan Dayton. As stated in the case of Mississippi, it is probable they both voted for it. They would not have allowed it to pass without recording their opposition to it, if, in their understanding, it violated either the line properly dividing local from federal authority, or any provision of the Constitution. In 1819-20, came and passed the Missouri question. Many votes were taken, by yeas and nays, in both branches of Congress, upon the various phases of the general question. Two of the \\\"thirty-nine\\\" - Rufus King and Charles Pinckney - were members of that Congress. Mr. King steadily voted for slavery prohibition and against all compromises, while Mr. Pinckney as steadily voted against slavery prohibition and against all compromises. By this, Mr. King showed that, in his understanding, no line dividing local from federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, was violated by Congress prohibiting slavery in federal territory; while Mr. Pinckney, by his votes, showed that, in his understanding, there was some sufficient reason for opposing such prohibition in that case. The cases I have mentioned are the only acts of the \\\"thirty-nine,\\\" or of any of them, upon the direct issue, which I have been able to discover. To enumerate the persons who thus acted, as being four in 1784, two in 1787, seventeen in 1789, three in 1798, two in 1804, and two in 1819-20 - there would be thirty of them. But this would be counting John Langdon, Roger Sherman, William Few, Rufus King, and George Read each twice, and Abraham Baldwin, three times. The true number of those of the \\\"thirty-nine\\\" whom I have shown to have acted upon the question, which, by the text, they understood better than we, is twenty-three, leaving sixteen not shown to have acted upon it in any way. Here, then, we have twenty-three out of our thirty-nine fathers \\\"who framed the government under which we live,\\\" who have, upon their official responsibility and their corporal oaths, acted upon the very question which the text affirms they \\\"understood just as well, and even better than we do now;\\\" and twenty-one of them - a clear majority of the whole \\\"thirty-nine\\\" - so acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross political impropriety and willful perjury, if, in their understanding, any proper division between local and federal authority, or anything in the Constitution they had made themselves, and sworn to support, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the federal territories. Thus the twenty-one acted; and, as actions speak louder than words, so actions, under such responsibility, speak still louder. Two of the twenty-three voted against Congressional prohibition of slavery in the federal territories, in the instances in which they acted upon the question. But for what reasons they so voted is not known. They may have done so because they thought a proper division of local from federal authority, or some provision or principle of the Constitution, stood in the way; or they may, without any such question, have voted against the prohibition, on what appeared to them to be sufficient grounds of expediency. No one who has sworn to support the Constitution can conscientiously vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional measure, however expedient he may think it; but one may and ought to vote against a measure which he deems constitutional, if, at the same time, he deems it inexpedient. It, therefore, would be unsafe to set down even the two who voted against the prohibition, as having done so because, in their understanding, any proper division of local from federal authority, or anything in the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in federal territory. The remaining sixteen of the \\\"thirty-nine,\\\" so far as I have discovered, have left no record of their understanding upon the direct question of federal control of slavery in the federal territories. But there is much reason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not have appeared different from that of their twenty-three compeers, had it been manifested at all. For the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text, I have purposely omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any person, however distinguished, other than the thirty-nine fathers who framed the original Constitution; and, for the same reason, I have also omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any of the \\\"thirty-nine\\\" even, on any other phase of the general question of slavery. If we should look into their acts and declarations on those other phases, as the foreign slave trade, and the morality and policy of slavery generally, it would appear to us that on the direct question of federal control of slavery in federal territories, the sixteen, if they had acted at all, would probably have acted just as the twenty-three did. Among that sixteen were several of the most noted anti-slavery men of those times - as Dr. Franklin, Alexander Hamilton and Gouverneur Morris - while there was not one now known to have been otherwise, unless it may be John Rutledge, of South Carolina. The sum of the whole is, that of our thirty-nine fathers who framed the original Constitution, twenty-one - a clear majority of the whole - certainly understood that no proper division of local from federal authority, nor any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control slavery in the federal territories; while all the rest probably had the same understanding. Such, unquestionably, was the understanding of our fathers who framed the original Constitution; and the text affirms that they understood the question \\\"better than we.\\\" But, so far, I have been considering the understanding of the question manifested by the framers of the original Constitution. In and by the original instrument, a mode was provided for amending it; and, as I have already stated, the present frame of \\\"the Government under which we live\\\" consists of that original, and twelve amendatory articles framed and adopted since. Those who now insist that federal control of slavery in federal territories violates the Constitution, point us to the provisions which they suppose it thus violates; and, as I understand, that all fix upon provisions in these amendatory articles, and not in the original instrument. The Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott case, plant themselves upon the fifth amendment, which provides that no person shall be deprived of \\\"life, liberty or property without due process of law;\\\" while Senator Douglas and his peculiar adherents plant themselves upon the tenth amendment, providing that \\\"the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution\\\" \\\"are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\\\" Now, it so happens that these amendments were framed by the first Congress which sat under the Constitution - the identical Congress which passed the act already mentioned, enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory. Not only was it the same Congress, but they were the identical, same individual men who, at the same session, and at the same time within the session, had under consideration, and in progress toward maturity, these Constitutional amendments, and this act prohibiting slavery in all the territory the nation then owned. The Constitutional amendments were introduced before, and passed after the act enforcing the Ordinance of '87; so that, during the whole pendency of the act to enforce the Ordinance, the Constitutional amendments were also pending. The seventy-six members of that Congress, including sixteen of the framers of the original Constitution, as before stated, were pre- eminently our fathers who framed that part of \\\"the Government under which we live,\\\" which is now claimed as forbidding the Federal Government to control slavery in the federal territories. Is it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to affirm that the two things which that Congress deliberately framed, and carried to maturity at the same time, are absolutely inconsistent with each other? And does not such affirmation become impudently absurd when coupled with the other affirmation from the same mouth, that those who did the two things, alleged to be inconsistent, understood whether they really were inconsistent better than we - better than he who affirms that they are inconsistent? It is surely safe to assume that the thirty-nine framers of the original Constitution, and the seventy-six members of the Congress which framed the amendments thereto, taken together, do certainly include those who may be fairly called \\\"our fathers who framed the Government under which we live.\\\" And so assuming, I defy any man to show that any one of them ever, in his whole life, declared that, in his understanding, any proper division of local from federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the federal territories. I go a step further. I defy any one to show that any living man in the whole world ever did, prior to the beginning of the present century, (and I might almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present century,) declare that, in his understanding, any proper division of local from federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the federal territories. To those who now so declare, I give, not only \\\"our fathers who framed the Government under which we live,\\\" but with them all other living men within the century in which it was framed, among whom to search, and they shall not be able to find the evidence of a single man agreeing with them. Now, and here, let me guard a little against being misunderstood. I do not mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers did. To do so, would be to discard all the lights of current experience - to reject all progress - all improvement. What I do say is, that if we would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case, we should do so upon evidence so conclusive, and argument so clear, that even their great authority, fairly considered and weighed, cannot stand; and most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the question better than we. If any man at this day sincerely believes that a proper division of local from federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbids the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the federal territories, he is right to say so, and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument which he can. But he has no right to mislead others, who have less access to history, and less leisure to study it, into the false belief that \\\"our fathers who framed the Government under which we live\\\" were of the same opinion - thus substituting falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair argument. If any man at this day sincerely believes \\\"our fathers who framed the Government under which we live,\\\" used and applied principles, in other cases, which ought to have led them to understand that a proper division of local from federal authority or some part of the Constitution, forbids the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the federal territories, he is right to say so. But he should, at the same time, brave the responsibility of declaring that, in his opinion, he understands their principles better than they did themselves; and especially should he not shirk that responsibility by asserting that they \\\"understood the question just as well, and even better, than we do now.\\\" But enough! Let all who believe that \\\"our fathers, who framed the Government under which we live, understood this question just as well, and even better, than we do now,\\\" speak as they spoke, and act as they acted upon it. This is all Republicans ask - all Republicans desire - in relation to slavery. As those fathers marked it, so let it be again marked, as an evil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected only because of and so far as its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a necessity. Let all the guarantees those fathers gave it, be, not grudgingly, but fully and fairly, maintained. For this Republicans contend, and with this, so far as I know or believe, they will be content. And now, if they would listen - as I suppose they will not - I would address a few words to the Southern people. I would say to them: - You consider yourselves a reasonable and a just people; and I consider that in the general qualities of reason and justice you are not inferior to any other people. Still, when you speak of us Republicans, you do so only to denounce us a reptiles, or, at the best, as no better than outlaws. You will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers, but nothing like it to \\\"Black Republicans.\\\" In all your contentions with one another, each of you deems an unconditional condemnation of \\\"Black Republicanism\\\" as the first thing to be attended to. Indeed, such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable prerequisite - license, so to speak - among you to be admitted or permitted to speak at all. Now, can you, or not, be prevailed upon to pause and to consider whether this is quite just to us, or even to yourselves? Bring forward your charges and specifications, and then be patient long enough to hear us deny or justify. You say we are sectional. We deny it. That makes an issue; and the burden of proof is upon you. You produce your proof; and what is it? Why, that our party has no existence in your section - gets no votes in your section. The fact is substantially true; but does it prove the issue? If it does, then in case we should, without change of principle, begin to get votes in your section, we should thereby cease to be sectional. You cannot escape this conclusion; and yet, are you willing to abide by it? If you are, you will probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional, for we shall get votes in your section this very year. You will then begin to discover, as the truth plainly is, that your proof does not touch the issue. The fact that we get no votes in your section, is a fact of your making, and not of ours. And if there be fault in that fact, that fault is primarily yours, and remains until you show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice. If we do repel you by any wrong principle or practice, the fault is ours; but this brings you to where you ought to have started - to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle. If our principle, put in practice, would wrong your section for the benefit of ours, or for any other object, then our principle, and we with it, are sectional, and are justly opposed and denounced as such. Meet us, then, on the question of whether our principle, put in practice, would wrong your section; and so meet it as if it were possible that something may be said on our side. Do you accept the challenge? No! Then you really believe that the principle which \\\"our fathers who framed the Government under which we live\\\" thought so clearly right as to adopt it, and indorse it again and again, upon their official oaths, is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation without a moment's consideration. Some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional parties given by Washington in his Farewell Address. Less than eight years before Washington gave that warning, he had, as President of the United States, approved and signed an act of Congress, enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory, which act embodied the policy of the Government upon that subject up to and at the very moment he penned that warning; and about one year after he penned it, he wrote LaFayette that he considered that prohibition a wise measure, expressing in the same connection his hope that we should at some time have a confederacy of free States. Bearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon this same subject, is that warning a weapon in your hands against us, or in our hands against you? Could Washington himself speak, would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy, or upon you who repudiate it? We respect that warning of Washington, and we commend it to you, together with his example pointing to the right application of it. But you say you are conservative - eminently conservative - while we are revolutionary, destructive, or something of the sort. What is conservatism? Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried? We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by \\\"our fathers who framed the Government under which we live;\\\" while you with one accord reject, and scout, and spit upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting something new. True, you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be. You are divided on new propositions and plans, but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers. Some of you are for reviving the foreign slave trade; some for a Congressional Slave-Code for the Territories; some for Congress forbidding the Territories to prohibit Slavery within their limits; some for maintaining Slavery in the Territories through the judiciary; some for the \\\"gur-reat pur-rinciple\\\" that \\\"if one man would enslave another, no third man should object,\\\" fantastically called \\\"Popular Sovereignty;\\\" but never a man among you is in favor of federal prohibition of slavery in federal territories, according to the practice of \\\"our fathers who framed the Government under which we live.\\\" Not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our Government originated. Consider, then, whether your claim of conservatism for yourselves, and your charge or destructiveness against us, are based on the most clear and stable foundations. Again, you say we have made the slavery question more prominent than it formerly was. We deny it. We admit that it is more prominent, but we deny that we made it so. It was not we, but you, who discarded the old policy of the fathers. We resisted, and still resist, your innovation; and thence comes the greater prominence of the question. Would you have that question reduced to its former proportions? Go back to that old policy. What has been will be again, under the same conditions. If you would have the peace of the old times, readopt the precepts and policy of the old times. You charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves. We deny it; and what is your proof? Harper's Ferry! John Brown!! John Brown was no Republican; and you have failed to implicate a single Republican in his Harper's Ferry enterprise. If any member of our party is guilty in that matter, you know it or you do not know it. If you do know it, you are inexcusable for not designating the man and proving the fact. If you do not know it, you are inexcusable for asserting it, and especially for persisting in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof. You need to be told that persisting in a charge which one does not know to be true, is simply malicious slander. Some of you admit that no Republican designedly aided or encouraged the Harper's Ferry affair, but still insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such results. We do not believe it. We know we hold to no doctrine, and make no declaration, which were not held to and made by \\\"our fathers who framed the Government under which we live.\\\" You never dealt fairly by us in relation to this affair. When it occurred, some important State elections were near at hand, and you were in evident glee with the belief that, by charging the blame upon us, you could get an advantage of us in those elections. The elections came, and your expectations were not quite fulfilled. Every Republican man knew that, as to himself at least, your charge was a slander, and he was not much inclined by it to cast his vote in your favor. Republican doctrines and declarations are accompanied with a continual protest against any interference whatever with your slaves, or with you about your slaves. Surely, this does not encourage them to revolt. True, we do, in common with \\\"our fathers, who framed the Government under which we live,\\\" declare our belief that slavery is wrong; but the slaves do not hear us declare even this. For anything we say or do, the slaves would scarcely know there is a Republican party. I believe they would not, in fact, generally know it but for your misrepresentations of us, in their hearing. In your political contests among yourselves, each faction charges the other with sympathy with Black Republicanism; and then, to give point to the charge, defines Black Republicanism to simply be insurrection, blood and thunder among the slaves. Slave insurrections are no more common now than they were before the Republican party was organized. What induced the Southampton insurrection, twenty-eight years ago, in which, at least three times as many lives were lost as at Harper's Ferry? You can scarcely stretch your very elastic fancy to the conclusion that Southampton was \\\"got up by Black Republicanism.\\\" In the present state of things in the United States, I do not think a general, or even a very extensive slave insurrection is possible. The indispensable concert of action cannot be attained. The slaves have no means of rapid communication; nor can incendiary freemen, black or white, supply it. The explosive materials are everywhere in parcels; but there neither are, nor can be supplied, the indispensable connecting trains. Much is said by Southern people about the affection of slaves for their masters and mistresses; and a part of it, at least, is true. A plot for an uprising could scarcely be devised and communicated to twenty individuals before some one of them, to save the life of a favorite master or mistress, would divulge it. This is the rule; and the slave revolution in Hayti was not an exception to it, but a case occurring under peculiar circumstances. The gunpowder plot of British history, though not connected with slaves, was more in point. In that case, only about twenty were admitted to the secret; and yet one of them, in his anxiety to save a friend, betrayed the plot to that friend, and, by consequence, averted the calamity. Occasional poisonings from the kitchen, and open or stealthy assassinations in the field, and local revolts extending to a score or so, will continue to occur as the natural results of slavery; but no general insurrection of slaves, as I think, can happen in this country for a long time. Whoever much fears, or much hopes for such an event, will be alike disappointed. In the language of Mr. Jefferson, uttered many years ago, \\\"It is still in our power to direct the process of emancipation, and deportation, peaceably, and in such slow degrees, as that the evil will wear off insensibly; and their places be, pari passu, filled up by free white laborers. If, on the contrary, it is left to force itself on, human nature must shudder at the prospect held up.\\\" Mr. Jefferson did not mean to say, nor do I, that the power of emancipation is in the Federal Government. He spoke of Virginia; and, as to the power of emancipation, I speak of the slaveholding States only. The Federal Government, however, as we insist, has the power of restraining the extension of the institution - the power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any American soil which is now free from slavery. John Brown's effort was peculiar. It was not a slave insurrection. It was an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves, in which the slaves refused to participate. In fact, it was so absurd that the slaves, with all their ignorance, saw plainly enough it could not succeed. That affair, in its philosophy, corresponds with the many attempts, related in history, at the assassination of kings and emperors. An enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by Heaven to liberate them. He ventures the attempt, which ends in little else than his own execution. Orsini's attempt on Louis Napoleon, and John Brown's attempt at Harper's Ferry were, in their philosophy, precisely the same. The eagerness to cast blame on old England in the one case, and on New England in the other, does not disprove the sameness of the two things. And how much would it avail you, if you could, by the use of John Brown, Helper's Book, and the like, break up the Republican organization? Human action can be modified to some extent, but human nature cannot be changed. There is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation, which cast at least a million and a half of votes. You cannot destroy that judgment and feeling - that sentiment - by breaking up the political organization which rallies around it. You can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your heaviest fire; but if you could, how much would you gain by forcing the sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot-box, into some other channel? What would that other channel probably be? Would the number of John Browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation? But you will break up the Union rather than submit to a denial of your Constitutional rights. That has a somewhat reckless sound; but it would be palliated, if not fully justified, were we proposing, by the mere force of numbers, to deprive you of some right, plainly written down in the Constitution. But we are proposing no such thing. When you make these declarations, you have a specific and well-understood allusion to an assumed Constitutional right of yours, to take slaves into the federal territories, and to hold them there as property. But no such right is specifically written in the Constitution. That instrument is literally silent about any such right. We, on the contrary, deny that such a right has any existence in the Constitution, even by implication. Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy the Government, unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution as you please, on all points in dispute between you and us. You will rule or ruin in all events. This, plainly stated, is your language. Perhaps you will say the Supreme Court has decided the disputed Constitutional question in your favor. Not quite so. But waiving the lawyer's distinction between dictum and decision, the Court have decided the question for you in a sort of way. The Court have substantially said, it is your Constitutional right to take slaves into the federal territories, and to hold them there as property. When I say the decision was made in a sort of way, I mean it was made in a divided Court, by a bare majority of the Judges, and they not quite agreeing with one another in the reasons for making it; that it is so made as that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning, and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of fact - the statement in the opinion that \\\"the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution.\\\" An inspection of the Constitution will show that the right of property in a slave is not \\\"distinctly and expressly affirmed\\\" in it. Bear in mind, the Judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right is impliedly affirmed in the Constitution; but they pledge their veracity that it is \\\"distinctly and expressly\\\" affirmed there - \\\"distinctly,\\\" that is, not mingled with anything else - \\\"expressly,\\\" that is, in words meaning just that, without the aid of any inference, and susceptible of no other meaning. If they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such right is affirmed in the instrument by implication, it would be open to others to show that neither the word \\\"slave\\\" nor \\\"slavery\\\" is to be found in the Constitution, nor the word \\\"property\\\" even, in any connection with language alluding to the things slave, or slavery; and that wherever in that instrument the slave is alluded to, he is called a \\\"person;\\\" - and wherever his master's legal right in relation to him is alluded to, it is spoken of as \\\"service or labor which may be due,\\\" - as a debt payable in service or labor. Also, it would be open to show, by contemporaneous history, that this mode of alluding to slaves and slavery, instead of speaking of them, was employed on purpose to exclude from the Constitution the idea that there could be property in man. To show all this, is easy and certain. When this obvious mistake of the Judges shall be brought to their notice, is it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement, and reconsider the conclusion based upon it? And then it is to be remembered that \\\"our fathers, who framed the Government under which we live\\\" - the men who made the Constitution - decided this same Constitutional question in our favor, long ago - decided it without division among themselves, when making the decision; without division among themselves about the meaning of it after it was made, and, so far as any evidence is left, without basing it upon any mistaken statement of facts. Under all these circumstances, do you really feel yourselves justified to break up this Government unless such a court decision as yours is, shall be at once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of political action? But you will not abide the election of a Republican president! In that supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us! That is cool. A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters through his teeth, \\\"Stand and deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you will be a murderer!\\\" To be sure, what the robber demanded of me - my money - was my own; and I had a clear right to keep it; but it was no more my own than my vote is my own; and the threat of death to me, to extort my money, and the threat of destruction to the Union, to extort my vote, can scarcely be distinguished in principle. A few words now to Republicans. It is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great Confederacy shall be at peace, and in harmony, one with another. Let us Republicans do our part to have it so. Even though much provoked, let us do nothing through passion and ill temper. Even though the southern people will not so much as listen to us, let us calmly consider their demands, and yield to them if, in our deliberate view of our duty, we possibly can. Judging by all they say and do, and by the subject and nature of their controversy with us, let us determine, if we can, what will satisfy them. Will they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered to them? We know they will not. In all their present complaints against us, the Territories are scarcely mentioned. Invasions and insurrections are the rage now. Will it satisfy them, if, in the future, we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections? We know it will not. We so know, because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and insurrections; and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation. The question recurs, what will satisfy them? Simply this: We must not only let them alone, but we must somehow, convince them that we do let them alone. This, we know by experience, is no easy task. We have been so trying to convince them from the very beginning of our organization, but with no success. In all our platforms and speeches we have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone; but this has had no tendency to convince them. Alike unavailing to convince them, is the fact that they have never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them. These natural, and apparently adequate means all failing, what will convince them? This, and this only: cease to call slavery wrong, and join them in calling it right. And this must be done thoroughly - done in acts as well as in words. Silence will not be tolerated - we must place ourselves avowedly with them. Senator Douglas' new sedition law must be enacted and enforced, suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong, whether made in politics, in presses, in pulpits, or in private. We must arrest and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure. We must pull down our Free State constitutions. The whole atmosphere must be disinfected from all taint of opposition to slavery, before they will cease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us. I am quite aware they do not state their case precisely in this way. Most of them would probably say to us, \\\"Let us alone, do nothing to us, and say what you please about slavery.\\\" But we do let them alone - have never disturbed them - so that, after all, it is what we say, which dissatisfies them. They will continue to accuse us of doing, until we cease saying. I am also aware they have not, as yet, in terms, demanded the overthrow of our Free-State Constitutions. Yet those Constitutions declare the wrong of slavery, with more solemn emphasis, than do all other sayings against it; and when all these other sayings shall have been silenced, the overthrow of these Constitutions will be demanded, and nothing be left to resist the demand. It is nothing to the contrary, that they do not demand the whole of this just now. Demanding what they do, and for the reason they do, they can voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation. Holding, as they do, that slavery is morally right, and socially elevating, they cannot cease to demand a full national recognition of it, as a legal right, and a social blessing. Nor can we justifiably withhold this, on any ground save our conviction that slavery is wrong. If slavery is right, all words, acts, laws, and constitutions against it, are themselves wrong, and should be silenced, and swept away. If it is right, we cannot justly object to its nationality - its universality; if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its extension - its enlargement. All they ask, we could readily grant, if we thought slavery right; all we ask, they could as readily grant, if they thought it wrong. Their thinking it right, and our thinking it wrong, is the precise fact upon which depends the whole controversy. Thinking it right, as they do, they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition, as being right; but, thinking it wrong, as we do, can we yield to them? Can we cast our votes with their view, and against our own? In view of our moral, social, and political responsibilities, can we do this? Wrong as we think slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where it is, because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow it to spread into the National Territories, and to overrun us here in these Free States? If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our duty, fearlessly and effectively. Let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabored - contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong, vain as the search for a man who should be neither a living man nor a dead man - such as a policy of \\\"don't care\\\" on a question about which all true men do care - such as Union appeals beseeching true Union men to yield to Disunionists, reversing the divine rule, and calling, not the sinners, but the righteous to repentance - such as invocations to Washington, imploring men to unsay what Washington said, and undo what Washington did. Neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the Government nor of dungeons to ourselves. LET US HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MAKES MIGHT, AND IN THAT FAITH, LET US, TO THE END, DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT.\"\n",

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate - we can not hallow - this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\"\n",

            "    \"Text\" : \"At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. Then a statement, somewhat in detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phrase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention, and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured. On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thought were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it - all sought to avert it. While the inaugeral [sic] address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war - seeking to dissole [sic] the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive; and the other would accept war rather than let it perish. And the war came. One eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part o fit. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war, the magnitude, or the duration, which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered; that of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has his own purposes. \\\"Woe unto the world because of offences! For it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!\\\" If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those offences which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a Living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope-fervently do we pray-that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God will that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said \\\"the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether.\\\" With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan - to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.\"\n",

            "    \"Text\" : \"Fellow-citizens of the United States: In compliance with a custom as old as the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly, and to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed by the Constitution of the United States, to be taken by the President \\\"before he enters on the execution of his office.\\\" I do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement. Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States, that by the accession of a Republican Administration, their property, and their peace, and personal security, are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed, and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that \\\"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\\\" Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had made this, and many similar declarations, and had never recanted them. And more than this, they placed in the platform, for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves, and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read: \\\"Resolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and specially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend; and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what pretext, as among the gravest of crimes.\\\" I now reiterate these sentiments: and in doing so, I only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible, that the property, peace and security of no section are to be any wise endangered by the now incoming Administration. I add too, that al the protection which, consistently with the Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause-as cheerfully to one section as to another. There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions: \\\"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\\\" It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it, for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the intention of the law-giver is the law. All members of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution-to this provision as much as to any other. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause, \\\"shall be delivered up,\\\" their oaths are unanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they not, with nearly equal unanimity, frame, and pass a law, by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath? There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority; but surely that difference is not a very material one. IF the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him, or to others, by which authority it is done. And should any one, in any case, by content that his oath shall go unkept, on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept? Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a salve? And might it not be well, at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that \\\"the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States\\\"? I take the official oath to-day, with no mental reservations, and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws, by any hypercritical rules. And while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations, to conform to, and abide by, all those acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional. It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President under our national Constitution. During that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens, have, in succession, administered the executive branch of the government. They have conducted it through many perils; and, generally, with great success. Yet, with all this scope for [of] precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years, under great and peculiar difficulty. A disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably, attempted. I hold, that in contemplation of universal law, and of the Constitution, the Union of these Sates is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is safe to assert that no government proper, ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination. Continue to execute all the express provisions of our national Constitution, and Union will endure forever - it being impossible to destroy it, except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself. Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract, be peaceably unmade, by less than all the parties who made it? One party to a contract may violate it-break it, so to speak; but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it? Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that, in legal contemplation, the Union is perpetual, confirmed by the history of the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was formed in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was further matured and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778. And finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution, was \\\"to form a more perfect Union.\\\" But if [the] destruction of the Union by one, or by a part only, of the States, be lawfully possible, the Union is less perfect than before the Constitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity. It follows from these views that no State, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of the Union,-that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void, and that acts of violence within any State or States, against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances. I therefore consider that in view of the Constitution and the laws, the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part; and I shall perform it, so far as practicable, unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the requisite means, or, in some authoritative manner, direct the contrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself. In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority. The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the government, and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion-no using of force against or among the people anywhere. Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality, shall be so great and so universal, as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to face obnoxious strangers among the people for that object. While the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating, and so nearly impracticable with all, that I deem it better to forego, for the time, the uses of such offices. The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts of the Union. So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection. The course here indicated will be followed, unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper; and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles, and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections. That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will neither affirm or deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to them. To those, however, who really love the Union, may I not speak? Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric, with all its benefits, its memories and its hopes, would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? Will you hazard so desperate a step, while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly to, are greater than all the real ones you fly from? Will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake? All profess to be content in the Union, if all constitutional rights can be maintained. Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written in the Constitution, has been denied? I think not. Happily the human mind is so constituted, that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this. Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the Constitution has ever been denied. If, by the mere force of numbers, a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right, it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution-certainly would, if such a right were a vital one. But such is not our case. All the vital rights of minorities, and of individuals, are so plainly assured to them, by affirmations and negations, guarantees and prohibitions, in the Constitution, that controversies never arise concerning them. But no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration. Nor foresight can anticipate, nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions. Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by State authority? The Constitution does not expressly say. May Congress prohibit slavery in the territories? The Constitution does not expressly say. Must Congress protect slavery in the territories? The Constitution does not expressly say. From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities. If the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease. There is no other alternative; for continuing the government, is acquiescence on one side or the other. If a minority, in such case, will secede rather than acquiesce, they make a precedent which, in turn, will divide and ruin them; for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority. For instance, why may not any portion of a new confederacy, a year or two hence, arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it? All who cherish disunion sentiments, are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this. Is there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose a new Union, as to produce harmony only, and prevent renewed secession? Plainly, the central idea of secession, is the essence of anarchy. A majority, held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects it, does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy, or despotism in some form is all that is left. I do not forget the position assumed by some, that constitutional questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding in any case, upon the parties to a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government. And while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be over-ruled, and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice. At the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government upon vital questions, affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties, in personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. Nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges. It is a duty from which they may not shrink, to decide cases properly brought before them; and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes. One section of our country believes slavery is right, and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the suppression of the fugitive slave trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections, than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction, in one section; while the fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all, by the other. Physically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the presence, and beyond the reach of each other; but the different parts of our country cannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face; and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory, after separation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse, are again upon you. This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it. I cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national Constitution amended. While I made no recommendation of amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself; and I should under existing circumstances favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it. I will venture to add that to me the Convention mode seems preferable, in that it allow amendments to originate with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions, originated by others, not especially chosen for the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse. I understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution, which amendment, however, I have not seen, has passed Congress, to the effect that the federal government shall never interfere with the domestic institution so the States, including that of persons held to service. To avoid misconstruction of what I have said, I depart form my purpose not to speak of particular amendments, so far as to say that holding such a provision to now by implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable. The Chief Magistrate derives all his authority form the people, and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the States. The people themselves can do this also if they choose; but the executive as such, has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer the present government, as it came to his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him, to his successor. Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people? Is there any better or equal hope, in the world? In our present differences, is either party without faith of being in the right? If the Almighty Ruler of nations, with his eternal truth and justice, be on your side of the North or on yours of the South, that truth, and that justice, will surely prevail, by the judgment of this great tribunal, the American people. By the frame of the government under which we live, this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief; and have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals. While the people retain their virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of wickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years. My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well, upon this whole subject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be an object to hurry any of you, in hot haste, to a step which you would never take deliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated by it. Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it; while the new administration will have no immediate power, if it would, to change either. If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied, hold the right side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for precipitate action. Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him, who has never yet forsaken this favored land, are still competent to adjust, in the best way, all our present difficulty. In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail you. You can have no conflict, without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the most solemn one to \\\"preserve, protect and defend\\\" it. I am loth to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field, and patriot grave, to every living heart and heath-stone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\"\n",

            "    \"Text\" : \"The repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and the propriety of its restoration, constitute the subject of what I am about to say. As I desire to present my own connected view of this subject, my remarks will not be, specifically, an answer to Judge Douglas; yet, as I proceed, the main points he has presented will arise, and will receive such respectful attention as I may be able to give them. I wish further to say, that I do not propose to question the patriotism, or to assail the motives of any man, or class of men; but rather to strictly confine myself to the naked merits of the question. I also wish to be no less than National in all the positions I may take; and whenever I take ground which others have thought, or may think, narrow, sectional and dangerous to the Union, I hope to give a reason, which will appear sufficient, at least to some, why I think differently. And, as this subject is no other, than part and parcel of the larger general question of domestic-slavery, I wish to MAKE and to KEEP the distinction between the EXISTING institution, and the EXTENSION of it, so broad, and so clear, that no honest man can misunderstand me, and no dishonest one, successfully misrepresent me. In order to [get?] a clear understanding of what the Missouri Compromise is, a short history of the preceding kindred subjects will perhaps be proper. When we established our independence, we did not own, or claim, the country to which this compromise applies. Indeed, strictly speaking, the confederacy then owned no country at all; the States respectively owned the country within their limits; and some of them owned territory beyond their strict State limits. Virginia thus owned the North-Western territory---the country out of which the principal part of Ohio, all Indiana, all Illinois, all Michigan and all Wisconsin, have since been formed. She also owned (perhaps within her then limits) what has since been formed into the State of Kentucky. North Carolina thus owned what is now the State of Tennessee; and South Carolina and Georgia, in separate parts, owned what are now Mississippi and Alabama. Connecticut, I think, owned the little remaining part of Ohio---being the same where they now send Giddings to Congress, and beat all creation at making cheese. These territories, together with the States themselves, constituted all the country over which the confederacy then claimed any sort of jurisdiction. We were then living under the Articles of Confederation, which were superceded by the Constitution several years afterwards. The question of ceding these territories to the general government was set on foot. Mr. Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, and otherwise a chief actor in the revolution; then a delegate in Congress; afterwards twice President; who was, is, and perhaps will continue to be, the most distinguished politician of our history; a Virginian by birth and continued residence, and withal, a slave-holder; conceived the idea of taking that occasion, to prevent slavery ever going into the north-western territory. He prevailed on the Virginia Legislature to adopt his views, and to cede the territory, making the prohibition of slavery therein, a condition of the deed. Congress accepted the cession, with the condition; and in the first Ordinance (which the acts of Congress were then called) for the government of the territory, provided that slavery should never be permitted therein. This is the famed ordinance of '87 so often spoken of. Thenceforward, for sixty-one years, and until in 1848, the last scrap of this territory came into the Union as the State of Wisconsin, all parties acted in quiet obedience to this ordinance. It is now what Jefferson foresaw and intended---the happy home of teeming millions of free, white, prosperous people, and no slave amongst them. Thus, with the author of the Declaration of Independence, the policy of prohibiting slavery in new territory originated. Thus, away back of the constitution, in the pure fresh, free breath of the revolution, the State of Virginia, and the National congress put that policy in practice. Thus through sixty odd of the best years of the republic did that policy steadily work to its great and beneficent end. And thus, in those five states, and five millions of free, enterprising people, we have before us the rich fruits of this policy. But now new light breaks upon us. Now congress declares this ought never to have been; and the like of it, must never be again. The sacred right of self government is grossly violated by it! We even find some men, who drew their first breath, and every other breath of their lives, under this very restriction, now live in dread of absolute suffocation, if they should be restricted in the \\\"sacred right\\\" of taking slaves to Nebraska. That perfect liberty they sigh for---the liberty of making slaves of other people---Jefferson never thought of; their own father never thought of; they never thought of themselves, a year ago. How fortunate for them, they did not sooner become sensible of their great misery! Oh, how difficult it is to treat with respect, such assaults upon all we have ever really held sacred. But to return to history. In 1803 we purchased what was then called Louisiana, of France. It included the now states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, and Iowa; also the territory of Minnesota, and the present bone of contention, Kansas and Nebraska. Slavery already existed among the French at New Orleans; and, to some extent, at St. Louis. In 1812 Louisiana came into the Union as a slave state, without controversy. In 1818 or '19, Missouri showed signs of a wish to come in with slavery. This was resisted by northern members of Congress; and thus began the first great slavery agitation in the nation. This controversy lasted several months, and became very angry and exciting; the House of Representatives voting steadily for the prohibition of slavery in Missouri, and the Senate voting as steadily against it. Threats of breaking up the Union were freely made; and the ablest public men of the day became seriously alarmed. At length a compromise was made, in which, like all compromises, both sides yielded something. It was a law passed on the 6th day of March, 1820, providing that Missouri might come into the Union with slavery, but that in all the remaining part of the territory purchased of France, which lies north of 36 degrees and 30 minutes north latitude, slavery should never be permitted. This provision of law, is the Missouri Compromise. In excluding slavery North of the line, the same language is employed as in the Ordinance of '87. It directly applied to Iowa, Minnesota, and to the present bone of contention, Kansas and Nebraska. Whether there should or should not, be slavery south of that line, nothing was said in the law; but Arkansas constituted the principal remaining part, south of the line; and it has since been admitted as a slave state without serious controversy. More recently, Iowa, north of the line, came in as a free state without controversy. Still later, Minnesota, north of the line, had a territorial organization without controversy. Texas principally south of the line, and West of Arkansas; though originally within the purchase from France, had, in 1819, been traded off to Spain, in our treaty for the acquisition of Florida. It had thus become a part of Mexico. Mexico revolutionized and became independent of Spain. American citizens began settling rapidly, with their slaves in the southern part of Texas. Soon they revolutionized against Mexico, and established an independent government of their own, adopting a constitution, with slavery, strongly resembling the constitutions of our slave states. By still another rapid move, Texas, claiming a boundary much further West, than when we parted with her in 1819, was brought back to the United States, and admitted into the Union as a slave state. There then was little or no settlement in the northern part of Texas, a considerable portion of which lay north of the Missouri line; and in the resolutions admitting her into the Union, the Missouri restriction was expressly extended westward across her territory. This was in 1845, only nine years ago. Thus originated the Missouri Compromise; and thus has it been respected down to 1845. And even four years later, in 1849, our distinguished Senator, in a public address, held the following language in relation to it: \\\"The Missouri Compromise had been in practical operation for about a quarter of a century, and had received the sanction and approbation of men of all parties in every section of the Union. It had allayed all sectional jealousies and irritations growing out of this vexed question, and harmonized and tranquilized the whole country. It had given to Henry Clay, as its prominent champion, the proud sobriquet of the 'Great Pacificator' and by that title and for that service, his political friends had repeatedly appealed to the people to rally under his standard, as a presidential candidate, as the man who had exhibited the patriotism and the power to suppress, an unholy and treasonable agitation, and preserve the Union. He was not aware that any man or any party from any section of the Union, had ever urged as an objection to Mr. Clay, that he was the great champion of the Missouri Compromise. On the contrary, the effort was made by the opponents of Mr. Clay, to prove that he was not entitled to the exclusive merit of that great patriotic measure, and that the honor was equally due to others as well as to him, for securing its adoption---that it had its origin in the hearts of all patriotic men, who desired to preserve and perpetuate the blessings of our glorious Union---an origin akin that of the constitution of the United States, conceived in the same spirit of fraternal affection, and calculated to remove forever, the only danger, which seemed to threaten, at some distant day, to sever the social bond of union. All the evidences of public opinion at that day, seemed to indicate that this Compromise had been canonized in the hearts of the American people, as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would ever be reckless enough to disturb.\\\" I do not read this extract to involve Judge Douglas in an inconsistency. If he afterwards thought he had been wrong, it was right for him to change. I bring this forward merely to show the high estimate placed on the Missouri Compromise by all parties up to so late as the year 1849. But, going back a little, in point of time, our war with Mexico broke out in 1846. When Congress was about adjourning that session, President Polk asked them to place two millions of dollars under his control, to be used by him in the recess, if found practicable and expedient, in negociating a treaty of peace with Mexico, and acquiring some part of her territory. A bill was duly got up, for the purpose, and was progressing swimmingly, in the House of Representatives, when a member by the name of David Wilmot, a democrat from Pennsylvania, moved as an amendment \\\"Provided that in any territory thus acquired, there shall never be slavery.\\\" This is the origin of the far-famed 'Wilmot Proviso.' It created a great flutter; but it stuck like wax, was voted into the bill, and the bill passed with it through the House. The Senate, however, adjourned without final action on it and so both appropriation and proviso were lost, for the time. The war continued, and at the next session, the president renewed his request for the appropriation, enlarging the amount, I think, to three million. Again came the proviso; and defeated the measure. Congress adjourned again, and the war went on. In Dec., 1847, the new congress assembled. I was in the lower House that term. The \\\"Wilmot Proviso\\\" or the principle of it, was constantly coming up in some shape or other, and I think I may venture to say I voted for it at least forty times; during the short term I was there. The Senate, however, held it in check, and it never became law. In the spring of 1848 a treaty of peace was made with Mexico; by which we obtained that portion of her country which now constitutes the territories of New Mexico and Utah, and the now state of California. By this treaty the Wilmot Proviso was defeated, as so far as it was intended to be, a condition of the acquisition of territory. Its friends however, were still determined to find some way to restrain slavery from getting into the new country. This new acquisition lay directly West of our old purchase from France, and extended west to the Pacific ocean---and was so situated that if the Missouri line should be extended straight West, the new country would be divided by such extended line, leaving some North and some South of it. On Judge Douglas' motion a bill, or provision of a bill, passed the Senate to so extend the Missouri line. The Proviso men in the House, including myself, voted it down, because by implication, it gave up the Southern part to slavery, while we were bent on having it all free. In the fall of 1848 the gold mines were discovered in California. This attracted people to it with unprecedented rapidity, so that on, or soon after, the meeting of the new congress in Dec., 1849, she already had a population of nearly a hundred thousand, had called a convention, formed a state constitution, excluding slavery, and was knocking for admission into the Union. The Proviso men, of course were for letting her in, but the Senate, always true to the other side would not consent to her admission. And there California stood, kept out of the Union, because she would not let slavery into her borders. Under all the circumstances perhaps this was not wrong. There were other points of dispute, connected with the general question of slavery, which equally needed adjustment. The South clamored for a more efficient fugitive slave law. The North clamored for the abolition of a peculiar species of slave trade in the District of Columbia, in connection with which, in view from the windows of the capitol, a sort of negro-livery stable, where droves of negroes were collected, temporarily kept, and finally taken to Southern markets, precisely like droves of horses, had been openly maintained for fifty years. Utah and New Mexico needed territorial governments; and whether slavery should or should not be prohibited within them, was another question. The indefinite Western boundary of Texas was to be settled. She was received a slave state; and consequently the farther West the slavery men could push her boundary, the more slave country they secured. And the farther East the slavery opponents could thrust the boundary back, the less slave ground was secured. Thus this was just as clearly a slavery question as any of the others. These points all needed adjustment; and they were all held up, perhaps wisely to make them help to adjust one another. The Union, now, as in 1820, was thought to be in danger; and devotion to the Union rightfully inclined men to yield somewhat, in points where nothing else could have so inclined them. A compromise was finally effected. The south got their new fugitive-slave law; and the North got California, (the far best part of our acquisition from Mexico,) as a free State. The south got a provision that New Mexico and Utah, when admitted as States, may come in with or without slavery as they may then choose; and the north got the slave-trade abolished in the District of Columbia. The north got the western boundary of Texas, thence further back eastward than the south desired; but, in turn, they gave Texas ten millions of dollars, with which to pay her old debts. This is the Compromise of 1850. Preceding the Presidential election of 1852, each of the great political parties, democrats and whigs, met in convention, and adopted resolutions endorsing the compromise of '50; as a \\\"finality,\\\" a final settlement, so far as these parties could make it so, of all slavery agitation. Previous to this, in 1851, the Illinois Legislature had indorsed it. During this long period of time Nebraska had remained, substantially an uninhabited country, but now emigration to, and settlement within it began to take place. It is about one third as large as the present United States, and its importance so long overlooked, begins to come into view. The restriction of slavery by the Missouri Compromise directly applies to it; in fact, was first made, and has since been maintained, expressly for it. In 1853, a bill to give it a territorial government passed the House of Representatives, and, in the hands of Judge Douglas, failed of passing the Senate only for want of time. This bill contained no repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Indeed, when it was assailed because it did not contain such repeal, Judge Douglas defended it in its existing form. On January 4th, 1854, Judge Douglas introduces a new bill to give Nebraska territorial government. He accompanies this bill with a report, in which last, he expressly recommends that the Missouri Compromise shall neither be affirmed nor repealed. Before long the bill is so modified as to make two territories instead of one; calling the Southern one Kansas. Also, about a month after the introduction of the bill, on the judge's own motion, it is so amended as to declare the Missouri Compromise inoperative and void; and, substantially, that the People who go and settle there may establish slavery, or exclude it, as they may see fit. In this shape the bill passed both branches of congress, and became a law. This is the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. The foregoing history may not be precisely accurate in every particular; but I am sure it is sufficiently so, for all the uses I shall attempt to make of it, and in it, we have before us, the chief material enabling us to correctly judge whether the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is right or wrong. I think, and shall try to show, that it is wrong; wrong in its direct effect, letting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska---and wrong in its prospective principle, allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world, where men can be found inclined to take it. This declared indifference, but as I must think, covert real zeal for the spread of slavery, I can not but hate. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world---enables the enemies of free institutions, with plausibility, to taunt us as hypocrites---causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity, and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty---criticising the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self-interest. Before proceeding, let me say I think I have no prejudice against the Southern people. They are just what we would be in their situation. If slavery did not now exist amongst them, they would not introduce it. If it did now exist amongst us, we should not instantly give it up. This I believe of the masses north and south. Doubtless there are individuals, on both sides, who would not hold slaves under any circumstances; and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew, if it were out of existence. We know that some southern men do free their slaves, go north, and become tip-top abolitionists; while some northern ones go south, and become most cruel slave-masters. When southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery, than we; I acknowledge the fact. When it is said that the institution exists; and that it is very difficult to get rid of it, in any satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself. If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do, as to the existing institution. My first impulse would be to free all the slaves, and send them to Liberia,---to their own native land. But a moment's reflection would convince me, that whatever of high hope, (as I think there is) there may be in this, in the long run, its sudden execution is impossible. If they were all landed there in a day, they would all perish in the next ten days; and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the world to carry them there in many times ten days. What then? Free them all, and keep them among us as underlings? Is it quite certain that this betters their condition? I think I would not hold one in slavery, at any rate; yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon. What next? Free them, and make them politically and socially, our equals? My own feelings will not admit of this; and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not. Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment, is not the sole question, if indeed, it is any part of it. A universal feeling, whether well or ill-founded, can not be safely disregarded. We can not, then, make them equals. It does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted; but for their tardiness in this, I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the south. When they remind us of their constitutional rights, I acknowledge them, not grudgingly, but fully, and fairly; and I would give them any legislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives, which should not, in its stringency, be more likely to carry a free man into slavery, than our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one. But all this; to my judgment, furnishes no more excuse for permitting slavery to go into our own free territory, than it would for reviving the African slave trade by law. The law which forbids the bringing of slaves from Africa; and that which has so long forbid the taking them to Nebraska, can hardly be distinguished on any moral principle; and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that of the latter. The arguments by which the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is sought to be justified, are these: First, that the Nebraska country needed a territorial government. Second, that in various ways, the public had repudiated it, and demanded the repeal; and therefore should not now complain of it. And lastly, that the repeal establishes a principle, which is intrinsically right. I will attempt an answer to each of them in its turn. First, then, if that country was in need of a territorial organization, could it not have had it as well without as with the repeal? Iowa and Minnesota, to both of which the Missouri restriction applied, had, without its repeal, each in succession, territorial organizations. And even, the year before, a bill for Nebraska itself, was within an ace of passing, without the repealing clause; and this in the hands of the same men who are now the champions of repeal. Why no necessity then for the repeal? But still later, when this very bill was first brought in, it contained no repeal. But, say they, because the public had demanded, or rather commanded the repeal, the repeal was to accompany the organization, whenever that should occur. Now I deny that the public ever demanded any such thing---ever repudiated the Missouri Compromise---ever commanded its repeal. I deny it, and call for the proof. It is not contended, I believe, that any such command has ever been given in express terms. It is only said that it was done in principle. The support of the Wilmot Proviso, is the first fact mentioned, to prove that the Missouri restriction was repudiated in principle, and the second is, the refusal to extend the Missouri line over the country acquired from Mexico. These are near enough alike to be treated together. The one was to exclude the chances of slavery from the whole new acquisition by the lump; and the other was to reject a division of it, by which one half was to be given up to those chances. Now whether this was a repudiation of the Missouri line, in principle, depends upon whether the Missouri law contained any principle requiring the line to be extended over the country acquired from Mexico. I contend it did not. I insist that it contained no general principle, but that it was, in every sense, specific. That its terms limit it to the country purchased from France, is undenied and undeniable. It could have no principle beyond the intention of those who made it. They did not intend to extend the line to country which they did not own. If they intended to extend it, in the event of acquiring additional territory, why did they not say so? It was just as easy to say, that \\\"in all the country west of the Mississippi, which we now own, or may hereafter acquire there shall never be slavery,\\\" as to say, what they did say; and they would have said it if they had meant it. An intention to extend the law is not only not mentioned in the law, but is not mentioned in any contemporaneous history. Both the law itself, and the history of the times are a blank as to any principle of extension; and by neither the known rules for construing statutes and contracts, nor by common sense, can any such principle be inferred. Another fact showing the specific character of the Missouri law---showing that it intended no more than it expressed---showing that the line was not intended as a universal dividing line between free and slave territory, present and prospective---north of which slavery could never go---is the fact that by that very law, Missouri came in as a slave state, north of the line. If that law contained any prospective principle, the whole law must be looked to in order to ascertain what the principle was. And by this rule, the south could fairly contend that inasmuch as they got one slave state north of the line at the inception of the law, they have the right to have another given them north of it occasionally---now and then in the indefinite westward extension of the line. This demonstrates the absurdity of attempting to deduce a prospective principle from the Missouri Compromise line. When we voted for the Wilmot Proviso, we were voting to keep slavery out of the whole Missouri [Mexican?] acquisition; and little did we think we were thereby voting, to let it into Nebraska, laying several hundred miles distant. When we voted against extending the Missouri line, little did we think we were voting to destroy the old line, then of near thirty years standing. To argue that we thus repudiated the Missouri Compromise is no less absurd than it would be to argue that because we have, so far, forborne to acquire Cuba, we have thereby, in principle, repudiated our former acquisitions, and determined to throw them out of the Union! No less absurd than it would be to say that because I may have refused to build an addition to my house, I thereby have decided to destroy the existing house! And if I catch you setting fire to my house, you will turn upon me and say I INSTRUCTED you to do it! The most conclusive argument, however, that, while voting for the Wilmot Proviso, and while voting against the EXTENSION of the Missouri line, we never thought of disturbing the original Missouri Compromise, is found in the facts, that there was then, and still is, an unorganized tract of fine country, nearly as large as the state of Missouri, lying immediately west of Arkansas, and south of the Missouri Compromise line; and that we never attempted to prohibit slavery as to it. I wish particular attention to this. It adjoins the original Missouri Compromise line, by its northern boundary; and consequently is part of the country, into which, by implication, slavery was permitted to go, by that compromise. There it has lain open ever since, and there it still lies. And yet no effort has been made at any time to wrest it from the south. In all our struggles to prohibit slavery within our Mexican acquisitions, we never so much as lifted a finger to prohibit it, as to this tract. Is not this entirely conclusive that at all times, we have held the Missouri Compromise as a sacred thing; even when against ourselves, as well as when for us? Senator Douglas sometimes says the Missouri line itself was, in principle, only an extension of the line of the ordinance of '87---that is to say, an extension of the Ohio river. I think this is weak enough on its face. I will remark, however that, as a glance at the map will show, the Missouri line is a long way farther South than Page the Ohio; and that if our Senator, in proposing his extension, had stuck to the principle of jogging southward, perhaps it might not have been voted down so readily. But next it is said that the compromises of '50 and the ratification of them by both political parties, in '52, established a new principle, which required the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. This again I deny. I deny it, and demand the proof. I have already stated fully what the compromises of '50 are. The particular part of those measures, for which the virtual repeal of the Missouri compromise is sought to be inferred (for it is admitted they contain nothing about it, in express terms) is the provision in the Utah and New Mexico laws, which permits them when they seek admission into the Union as States, to come in with or without slavery as they shall then see fit. Now I insist this provision was made for Utah and New Mexico, and for no other place whatever. It had no more direct reference to Nebraska than it had to the territories of the moon. But, say they, it had reference to Nebraska, in principle. Let us see. The North consented to this provision, not because they considered it right in itself; but because they were compensated---paid for it. They, at the same time, got California into the Union as a free State. This was far the best part of all they had struggled for by the Wilmot Proviso. They also got the area of slavery somewhat narrowed in the settlement of the boundary of Texas. Also, they got the slave trade abolished in the District of Columbia. For all these desirable objects the North could afford to yield something; and they did yield to the South the Utah and New Mexico provision. I do not mean that the whole North, or even a majority, yielded, when the law passed; but enough yielded, when added to the vote of the South, to carry the measure. Now can it be pretended that the principle of this arrangement requires us to permit the same provision to be applied to Nebraska, without any equivalent at all? Give us another free State; press the boundary of Texas still further back, give us another step toward the destruction of slavery in the District, and you present us a similar case. But ask us not to repeat, for nothing, what you paid for in the first instance. If you wish the thing again, pay again. That is the principle of the compromises of '50, if indeed they had any principles beyond their specific terms---it was the system of equivalents. Again, if Congress, at that time, intended that all future territories should, when admitted as States, come in with or without slavery, at their own option, why did it not say so? With such an universal provision, all know the bills could not have passed. Did they, then---could they---establish a principle contrary to their own intention? Still further, if they intended to establish the principle that wherever Congress had control, it should be left to the people to do as they thought fit with slavery why did they not authorize the people of the District of Columbia at their adoption to abolish slavery within these limits? I personally know that this has not been left undone, because it was unthought of. It was frequently spoken of by members of Congress and by citizens of Washington six years ago; and I heard no one express a doubt that a system of gradual emancipation, with compensation to owners, would meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of the District. But without the action of Congress they could say nothing; and Congress said ``no.'' In the measures of 1850 Congress had the subject of slavery in the District expressly in hand. If they were then establishing the principle of allowing the people to do as they please with slavery, why did they not apply the principle to that people? Again, it is claimed that by the Resolutions of the Illinois Legislature, passed in 1851, the repeal of the Missouri compromise was demanded. This I deny also. Whatever may be worked out by a criticism of the language of those resolutions, the people have never understood them as being any more than an endorsement of the compromises of 1850; and a release of our Senators from voting for the Wilmot Proviso. The whole people are living witnesses, that this only, was their view. Finally, it is asked \\\"If we did not mean to apply the Utah and New Mexico provision, to all future territories, what did we mean, when we, in 1852, endorsed the compromises of '50?\\\" For myself, I can answer this question most easily. I meant not to ask a repeal, or modification of the fugitive slave law. I meant not to ask for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. I meant not to resist the admission of Utah and New Mexico, even should they ask to come in as slave States. I meant nothing about additional territories, because, as I understood, we then had no territory whose character as to slavery was not already settled. As to Nebraska, I regarded its character as being fixed, by the Missouri compromise, for thirty years---as unalterably fixed as that of my own home in Illinois. As to new acquisitions I said \\\"sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\\\" When we make new acquaintances, [acquisitions?] we will, as heretofore, try to manage them some how. That is my answer. That is what I meant and said; and I appeal to the people to say, each for himself, whether that was not also the universal meaning of the free States. And now, in turn, let me ask a few questions. If by any, or all these matters, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was commanded, why was not the command sooner obeyed? Why was the repeal omitted in the Nebraska bill of 1853? Why was it omitted in the original bill of 1854? Why, in the accompanying report, was such a repeal characterized as a departure from the course pursued in 1850? and its continued omission recommended? I am aware Judge Douglas now argues that the subsequent express repeal is no substantial alteration of the bill. This argument seems wonderful to me. It is as if one should argue that white and black are not different. He admits, however, that there is a literal change in the bill; and that he made the change in deference to other Senators, who would not support the bill without. This proves that those other Senators thought the change a substantial one; and that the Judge thought their opinions worth deferring to. His own opinions, therefore, seem not to rest on a very firm basis even in his own mind---and I suppose the world believes, and will continue to believe, that precisely on the substance of that change this whole agitation has arisen. I conclude then, that the public never demanded the repeal of the Missouri compromise. I now come to consider whether the repeal, with its avowed principle, is intrinsically right. I insist that it is not. Take the particular case. A controversy had arisen between the advocates and opponents of slavery, in relation to its establishment within the country we had purchased of France. The southern, and then best part of the purchase, was already in as a slave state. The controversy was settled by also letting Missouri in as a slave State; but with the agreement that within all the remaining part of the purchase, North of a certain line, there should never be slavery. As to what was to be done with the remaining part south of the line, nothing was said; but perhaps the fair implication was, that it should come in with slavery if it should so choose. The southern part, except a portion heretofore mentioned, afterwards did come in with slavery, as the State of Arkansas. All these many years since 1820, the Northern part had remained a wilderness. At length settlements began in it also. In due course, Iowa, came in as a free State, and Minnesota was given a territorial government, without removing the slavery restriction. Finally the sole remaining part, North of the line, Kansas and Nebraska, was to be organized; and it is proposed, and carried, to blot out the old dividing line of thirty-four years standing, and to open the whole of that country to the introduction of slavery. Now, this, to my mind, is manifestly unjust. After an angry and dangerous controversy, the parties made friends by dividing the bone of contention. The one party first appropriates her own share, beyond all power to be disturbed in the possession of it; and then seizes the share of the other party. It is as if two starving men had divided their only loaf; the one had hastily swallowed his half, and then grabbed the other half just as he was putting it to his mouth! Let me here drop the main argument, to notice what I consider rather an inferior matter. It is argued that slavery will not go to Kansas and Nebraska, in any event. This is a palliation---a lullaby. I have some hope that it will not; but let us not be too confident. As to climate, a glance at the map shows that there are five slave States---Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri---and also the District of Columbia, all north of the Missouri compromise line. The census returns of 1850 show that, within these, there are 867,276 slaves---being more than one-fourth of all the slaves in the nation. It is not climate, then, that will keep slavery out of these territories. Is there any thing in the peculiar nature of the country? Missouri adjoins these territories, by her entire western boundary, and slavery is already within every one of her western counties. I have even heard it said that there are more slaves, in proportion to whites, in the north western county of Missouri, than within any county of the State. Slavery pressed entirely up to the old western boundary of the State, and when, rather recently, a part of that boundary, at the north-west was moved out a little farther west, slavery followed on quite up to the new line. Now, when the restriction is removed, what is to prevent it from going still further? Climate will not. No peculiarity of the country will---nothing in nature will. Will the disposition of the people prevent it? Those nearest the scene, are all in favor of the extension. The yankees, who are opposed to it may be more numerous; but in military phrase, the battle-field is too far from their base of operations. But it is said, there now is no law in Nebraska on the subject of slavery; and that, in such case, taking a slave there, operates his freedom. That is good book-law; but is not the rule of actual practice. Wherever slavery is, it has been first introduced without law. The oldest laws we find concerning it, are not laws introducing it; but regulating it, as an already existing thing. A white man takes his slave to Nebraska now; who will inform the negro that he is free? Who will take him before court to test the question of his freedom? In ignorance of his legal emancipation, he is kept chopping, splitting and plowing. Others are brought, and move on in the same track. At last, if ever the time for voting comes, on the question of slavery, the institution already in fact exists in the country, and cannot well be removed. The facts of its presence, and the difficulty of its removal will carry the vote in its favor. Keep it out until a vote is taken, and a vote in favor of it, can not be got in any population of forty thousand, on earth, who have been drawn together by the ordinary motives of emigration and settlement. To get slaves into the country simultaneously with the whites, in the incipient stages of settlement, is the precise stake played for, and won in this Nebraska measure. The question is asked us, \\\"If slaves will go in, notwithstanding the general principle of law liberates them, why would they not equally go in against positive statute law?---go in, even if the Missouri restriction were maintained?\\\" I answer, because it takes a much bolder man to venture in, with his property, in the latter case, than in the former---because the positive congressional enactment is known to, and respected by all, or nearly all; whereas the negative principle that no law is free law, is not much known except among lawyers. We have some experience of this practical difference. In spite of the Ordinance of '87, a few negroes were brought into Illinois, and held in a state of quasi slavery; not enough, however to carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when they came to form a constitution. But in the adjoining Missouri country, where there was no ordinance of '87---was no restriction---they were carried ten times, nay a hundred times, as fast, and actually made a slave State. This is fact---naked fact. Another LULLABY argument is, that taking slaves to new countries does not increase their number---does not make any one slave who otherwise would be free. There is some truth in this, and I am glad of it, but it [is] not WHOLLY true. The African slave trade is not yet effectually suppressed; and if we make a reasonable deduction for the white people amongst us, who are foreigners, and the descendants of foreigners, arriving here since 1808, we shall find the increase of the black population out-running that of the white, to an extent unaccountable, except by supposing that some of them too, have been coming from Africa. If this be so, the opening of new countries to the institution, increases the demand for, and augments the price of slaves, and so does, in fact, make slaves of freemen by causing them to be brought from Africa, and sold into bondage. But, however this may be, we know the opening of new countries to slavery, tends to the perpetuation of the institution, and so does KEEP men in slavery who otherwise would be free. This result we do not FEEL like favoring, and we are under no legal obligation to suppress our feelings in this respect. Equal justice to the south, it is said, requires us to consent to the extending of slavery to new countries. That is to say, inasmuch as you do not object to my taking my hog to Nebraska, therefore I must not object to you taking your slave. Now, I admit this is perfectly logical, if there is no difference between hogs and negroes. But while you thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro, I wish to ask whether you of the south yourselves, have ever been willing to do as much? It is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world, only a small percentage are natural tyrants. That percentage is no larger in the slave States than in the free. The great majority, south as well as north, have human sympathies, of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain. These sympathies in the bosoms of the southern people, manifest in many ways, their sense of the wrong of slavery, and their consciousness that, after all, there is humanity in the negro. If they deny this, let me address them a few plain questions. In 1820 you joined the north, almost unanimously, in declaring the African slave trade piracy, and in annexing to it the punishment of death. Why did you do this? If you did not feel that it was wrong, why did you join in providing that men should be hung for it? The practice was no more than bringing wild negroes from Africa, to sell to such as would buy them. But you never thought of hanging men for catching and selling wild horses, wild buffaloes or wild bears. Again, you have amongst you, a sneaking individual, of the class of native tyrants, known as the \\\"SLAVE-DEALER.\\\" He watches your necessities, and crawls up to buy your slave, at a speculating price. If you cannot help it, you sell to him; but if you can help it, you drive him from your door. You despise him utterly. You do not recognize him as a friend, or even as an honest man. Your children must not play with his; they may rollick freely with the little negroes, but not with the \\\"slave-dealer's children\\\". If you are obliged to deal with him, you try to get through the job without so much as touching him. It is common with you to join hands with the men you meet; but with the slave dealer you avoid the ceremony---instinctively shrinking from the snaky contact. If he grows rich and retires from business, you still remember him, and still keep up the ban of non-intercourse upon him and his family. Now why is this? You do not so treat the man who deals in corn, cattle or tobacco. And yet again; there are in the United States and territories, including the District of Columbia, 433,643 free blacks. At $500 per head they are worth over two hundred millions of dollars. How comes this vast amount of property to be running about without owners? We do not see free horses or free cattle running at large. How is this? All these free blacks are the descendants of slaves, or have been slaves themselves, and they would be slaves now, but for SOMETHING which has operated on their white owners, inducing them, at vast pecuniary sacrifices, to liberate them. What is that SOMETHING? Is there any mistaking it? In all these cases it is your sense of justice, and human sympathy, continually telling you, that the poor negro has some natural right to himself---that those who deny it, and make mere merchandise of him, deserve kickings, contempt and death. And now, why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave? and estimate him only as the equal of the hog? Why ask us to do what you will not do yourselves? Why ask us to do for nothing, what two hundred million of dollars could not induce you to do? But one great argument in the support of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, is still to come. That argument is \\\"the sacred right of self government.\\\" It seems our distinguished Senator has found great difficulty in getting his antagonists, even in the Senate to meet him fairly on this argument---some poet has said \\\"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\\\" At the hazzard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation, I meet that argument---I rush in, I take that bull by the horns. I trust I understand, and truly estimate the right of self-government. My faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own, lies at the foundation of the sense of justice there is in me. I extend the principles to communities of men, as well as to individuals. I so extend it, because it is politically wise, as well as naturally just; politically wise, in saving us from broils about matters which do not concern us. Here, or at Washington, I would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of Virginia, or the cranberry laws of Indiana. The doctrine of self government is right---absolutely and eternally right---but it has no just application, as here attempted. Or perhaps I should rather say that whether it has such just application depends upon whether a negro is not or is a man. If he is not a man, why in that case, he who is a man may, as a matter of self-government, do just as he pleases with him. But if the negro is a man, is it not to that extent, a total destruction of self-government, to say that he too shall not govern himself? When the white man governs himself that is self-government; but when he governs himself, and also governs another man, that is more than self-government---that is despotism. If the negro is a man, why then my ancient faith teaches me that \\\"all men are created equal;\\\" and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man's making a slave of another. Judge Douglas frequently, with bitter irony and sarcasm, paraphrases our argument by saying \\\"The white people of Nebraska are good enough to govern themselves, but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable negroes!!\\\" Well I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are, and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere. I do not say the contrary. What I do say is, that no man is good enough to govern another man, without that other's consent. I say this is the leading principle---the sheet anchor of American republicanism. Our Declaration of Independence says: \\\"We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.\\\" I have quoted so much at this time merely to show that according to our ancient faith, the just powers of governments are derived from the consent of the governed. Now the relation of masters and slaves is, PRO TANTO, a total violation of this principle. The master not only governs the slave without his consent; but he governs him by a set of rules altogether different from those which he prescribes for himself. Allow ALL the governed an equal voice in the government, and that, and that only is self government. Let it not be said I am contending for the establishment of political and social equality between the whites and blacks. I have already said the contrary. I am not now combating the argument of NECESSITY, arising from the fact that the blacks are already amongst us; but I am combating what is set up as MORAL argument for allowing them to be taken where they have never yet been---arguing against the EXTENSION of a bad thing, which where it already exists, we must of necessity, manage as we best can. In support of his application of the doctrine of self-government, Senator Douglas has sought to bring to his aid the opinions and examples of our revolutionary fathers. I am glad he has done this. I love the sentiments of those old-time men; and shall be most happy to abide by their opinions. He shows us that when it was in contemplation for the colonies to break off from Great Britain, and set up a new government for themselves, several of the states instructed their delegates to go for the measure PROVIDED EACH STATE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO REGULATE ITS DOMESTIC CONCERNS IN ITS OWN WAY. I do not quote; but this in substance. This was right. I see nothing objectionable in it. I also think it probable that it had some reference to the existence of slavery amongst them. I will not deny that it had. But had it, in any reference to the carrying of slavery into NEW COUNTRIES? That is the question; and we will let the fathers themselves answer it. This same generation of men, and mostly the same individuals of the generation, who declared this principle---who declared independence---who fought the war of the revolution through---who afterwards made the constitution under which we still live---these same men passed the ordinance of '87, declaring that slavery should never go to the north-west territory. I have no doubt Judge Douglas thinks they were very inconsistent in this. It is a question of discrimination between them and him. But there is not an inch of ground left for his claiming that their opinions---their example---their authority---are on his side in this controversy. Again, is not Nebraska, while a territory, a part of us? Do we not own the country? And if we surrender the control of it, do we not surrender the right of self-government? It is part of ourselves. If you say we shall not control it because it is ONLY part, the same is true of every other part; and when all the parts are gone, what has become of the whole? What is then left of us? What use for the general government, when there is nothing left for it [to] govern? But you say this question should be left to the people of Nebraska, because they are more particularly interested. If this be the rule, you must leave it to each individual to say for himself whether he will have slaves. What better moral right have thirty-one citizens of Nebraska to say, that the thirty-second shall not hold slaves, than the people of the thirty-one States have to say that slavery shall not go into the thirty-second State at all? But if it is a sacred right for the people of Nebraska to take and hold slaves there, it is equally their sacred right to buy them where they can buy them cheapest; and that undoubtedly will be on the coast of Africa; provided you will consent to not hang them for going there to buy them. You must remove this restriction too, from the sacred right of self-government. I am aware you say that taking slaves from the States of Nebraska, does not make slaves of freemen; but the African slave-trader can say just as much. He does not catch free negroes and bring them here. He finds them already slaves in the hands of their black captors, and he honestly buys them at the rate of about a red cotton handkerchief a head. This is very cheap, and it is a great abridgement of the sacred right of self-government to hang men for engaging in this profitable trade! Another important objection to this application of the right of self-government, is that it enables the first FEW, to deprive the succeeding MANY, of a free exercise of the right of self-government. The first few may get slavery IN, and the subsequent many cannot easily get it OUT. How common is the remark now in the slave States---\\\"If we were only clear of our slaves, how much better it would be for us.\\\" They are actually deprived of the privilege of governing themselves as they would, by the action of a very few, in the beginning. The same thing was true of the whole nation at the time our constitution was formed. Whether slavery shall go into Nebraska, or other new territories, is not a matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there. The whole nation is interested that the best use shall be made of these territories. We want them for the homes of free white people. This they cannot be, to any considerable extent, if slavery shall be planted within them. Slave States are places for poor white people to remove FROM; not to remove TO. New free States are the places for poor people to go to and better their condition. For this use, the nation needs these territories. Still further; there are constitutional relations between the slave and free States, which are degrading to the latter. We are under legal obligations to catch and return their runaway slaves to them---a sort of dirty, disagreeable job, which I believe, as a general rule the slave-holders will not perform for one another. Then again, in the control of the government---the management of the partnership affairs---they have greatly the advantage of us. By the constitution, each State has two Senators---each has a number of Representatives; in proportion to the number of its people---and each has a number of presidential electors, equal to the whole number of its Senators and Representatives together. But in ascertaining the number of the people, for this purpose, five slaves are counted as being equal to three whites. The slaves do not vote; they are only counted and so used, as to swell the influence of the white people's votes. The practical effect of this is more aptly shown by a comparison of the States of South Carolina and Maine. South Carolina has six representatives, and so has Maine; South Carolina has eight presidential electors, and so has Maine. This is precise equality so far; and, of course they are equal in Senators, each having two. Thus in the control of the government, the two States are equals precisely. But how are they in the number of their white people? Maine has 581,813---while South Carolina has 274,567. Maine has twice as many as South Carolina, and 32,679 over. Thus each white man in South Carolina is more than the double of any man in Maine. This is all because South Carolina, besides her free people, has 384,984 slaves. The South Carolinian has precisely the same advantage over the white man in every other free State, as well as in Maine. He is more than the double of any one of us in this crowd. The same advantage, but not to the same extent, is held by all the citizens of the slave States, over those of the free; and it is an absolute truth, without an exception, that there is no voter in any slave State, but who has more legal power in the government, than any voter in any free State. There is no instance of exact equality; and the disadvantage is against us the whole chapter through. This principle, in the aggregate, gives the slave States, in the present Congress, twenty additional representatives---being seven more than the whole majority by which they passed the Nebraska bill. Now all this is manifestly unfair; yet I do not mention it to complain of it, in so far as it is already settled. It is in the constitution; and I do not, for that cause, or any other cause, propose to destroy, or alter, or disregard the constitution. I stand to it, fairly, fully, and firmly. But when I am told I must leave it altogether to OTHER PEOPLE to say whether new partners are to be bred up and brought into the firm, on the same degrading terms against me. I respectfully demur. I insist, that whether I shall be a whole man, or only, the half of one, in comparison with others, is a question in which I am somewhat concerned; and one which no other man can have a sacred right of deciding for me. If I am wrong in this---if it really be a sacred right of self-government, in the man who shall go to Nebraska, to decide whether he will be the EQUAL of me or the DOUBLE of me, then after he shall have exercised that right, and thereby shall have reduced me to a still smaller fraction of a man than I already am, I should like for some gentleman deeply skilled in the mysteries of sacred rights, to provide himself with a microscope, and peep about, and find out, if he can, what has become of my sacred rights! They will surely be too small for detection with the naked eye. Finally, I insist, that if there is ANY THING which it is the duty of the WHOLE PEOPLE to never entrust to any hands but their own, that thing is the preservation and perpetuity, of their own liberties, and institutions. And if they shall think, as I do, that the extension of slavery endangers them, more than any, or all other causes, how recreant to themselves, if they submit the question, and with it, the fate of their country, to a mere hand-full of men, bent only on temporary self-interest. If this question of slavery extension were an insignificant one---one having no power to do harm---it might be shuffled aside in this way. But being, as it is, the great Behemoth of danger, shall the strong gripe of the nation be loosened upon him, to entrust him to the hands of such feeble keepers? I have done with this mighty argument, of self-government. Go, sacred thing! Go in peace. But Nebraska is urged as a great Union-saving measure. Well I too, go for saving the Union. Much as I hate slavery, I would consent to the extension of it rather than see the Union dissolved, just as I would consent to any GREAT evil, to avoid a GREATER one. But when I go to Union saving, I must believe, at least, that the means I employ has some adaptation to the end. To my mind, Nebraska has no such adaptation. \\\"It hath no relish of salvation in it.\\\" It is an aggravation, rather, of the only one thing which ever endangers the Union. When it came upon us, all was peace and quiet. The nation was looking to the forming of new bonds of Union; and a long course of peace and prosperity seemed to lie before us. In the whole range of possibility, there scarcely appears to me to have been any thing, out of which the slavery agitation could have been revived, except the very project of repealing the Missouri compromise. Every inch of territory we owned, already had a definite settlement of the slavery question, and by which, all parties were pledged to abide. Indeed, there was no uninhabited country on the continent, which we could acquire; if we except some extreme northern regions, which are wholly out of the question. In this state of case, the genius of Discord himself, could scarcely have invented a way of again getting [setting?] us by the ears, but by turning back and destroying the peace measures of the past. The councils of that genius seem to have prevailed, the Missouri compromise was repealed; and here we are, in the midst of a new slavery agitation, such, I think, as we have never seen before. Who is responsible for this? Is it those who resist the measure; or those who, causelessly, brought it forward, and pressed it through, having reason to know, and, in fact, knowing it must and would be so resisted? It could not but be expected by its author, that it would be looked upon as a measure for the extension of slavery, aggravated by a gross breach of faith. Argue as you will, and long as you will, this is the naked FRONT and ASPECT, of the measure. And in this aspect, it could not but produce agitation. Slavery is founded in the selfishness of man's nature---opposition to it, is [in?] his love of justice. These principles are an eternal antagonism; and when brought into collision so fiercely, as slavery extension brings them, shocks, and throes, and convulsions must ceaselessly follow. Repeal the Missouri compromise---repeal all compromises---repeal the declaration of independence---repeal all past history, you still can not repeal human nature. It still will be the abundance of man's heart, that slavery extension is wrong; and out of the abundance of his heart, his mouth will continue to speak. The structure, too, of the Nebraska bill is very peculiar. The people are to decide the question of slavery for themselves; but WHEN they are to decide; or HOW they are to decide; or whether, when the question is once decided, it is to remain so, or is it to be subject to an indefinite succession of new trials, the law does not say, Is it to be decided by the first dozen settlers who arrive there? or is it to await the arrival of a hundred? Is it to be decided by a vote of the people? or a vote of the legislature? or, indeed by a vote of any sort? To these questions, the law gives no answer. There is a mystery about this; for when a member proposed to give the legislature express authority to exclude slavery, it was hooted down by the friends of the bill. This fact is worth remembering. Some yankees, in the east, are sending emigrants to Nebraska, to exclude slavery from it; and, so far as I can judge, they expect the question to be decided by voting, in some way or other. But the Missourians are awake too. They are within a stone's throw of the contested ground. They hold meetings, and pass resolutions, in which not the slightest allusion to voting is made. They resolve that slavery already exists in the territory; that more shall go there; that they, remaining in Missouri will protect it; and that abolitionists shall be hung, or driven away. Through all this, bowie-knives and six-shooters are seen plainly enough; but never a glimpse of the ballot-box. And, really, what is to be the result of this? Each party WITHIN, having numerous and determined backers WITHOUT, is it not probable that the contest will come to blows, and bloodshed? Could there be a more apt invention to bring about collision and violence, on the slavery question, than this Nebraska project is? I do not charge, or believe, that such was intended by Congress; but if they had literally formed a ring, and placed champions within it to fight out the controversy, the fight could be no more likely to come off, than it is. And if this fight should begin, is it likely to take a very peaceful, Union-saving turn? Will not the first drop of blood so shed, be the real knell of the Union? The Missouri Compromise ought to be restored. For the sake of the Union, it ought to be restored. We ought to elect a House of Representatives which will vote its restoration. If by any means, we omit to do this, what follows? Slavery may or may not be established in Nebraska. But whether it be or not, we shall have repudiated---discarded from the councils of the Nation---the SPIRIT of COMPROMISE; for who after this will ever trust in a national compromise? The spirit of mutual concession---that spirit which first gave us the constitution, and which has thrice saved the Union---we shall have strangled and cast from us forever. And what shall we have in lieu of it? The South flushed with triumph and tempted to excesses; the North, betrayed, as they believe, brooding on wrong and burning for revenge. One side will provoke; the other resent. The one will taunt, the other defy; one agrees [aggresses?], the other retaliates. Already a few in the North, defy all constitutional restraints, resist the execution of the fugitive slave law, and even menace the institution of slavery in the states where it exists. Already a few in the South, claim the constitutional right to take to and hold slaves in the free states---demand the revival of the slave trade; and demand a treaty with Great Britain by which fugitive slaves may be reclaimed from Canada. As yet they are but few on either side. It is a grave question for the lovers of the Union, whether the final destruction of the Missouri Compromise, and with it the spirit of all compromise will or will not embolden and embitter each of these, and fatally increase the numbers of both. But restore the compromise, and what then? We thereby restore the national faith, the national confidence, the national feeling of brotherhood. We thereby reinstate the spirit of concession and compromise---that spirit which has never failed us in past perils, and which may be safely trusted for all the future. The south ought to join in doing this. The peace of the nation is as dear to them as to us. In memories of the past and hopes of the future, they share as largely as we. It would be on their part, a great act---great in its spirit, and great in its effect. It would be worth to the nation a hundred years' purchase of peace and prosperity. And what of sacrifice would they make? They only surrender to us, what they gave us for a consideration long, long ago; what they have not now, asked for, struggled or cared for; what has been thrust upon them, not less to their own astonishment than to ours. But it is said we cannot restore it; that though we elect every member of the lower house, the Senate is still against us. It is quite true, that of the Senators who passed the Nebraska bill, a majority of the whole Senate will retain their seats in spite of the elections of this and the next year. But if at these elections, their several constituencies shall clearly express their will against Nebraska, will these senators disregard their will? Will they neither obey, nor make room for those who will? But even if we fail to technically restore the compromise, it is still a great point to carry a popular vote in favor of the restoration. The moral weight of such a vote can not be estimated too highly. The authors of Nebraska are not at all satisfied with the destruction of the compromise---an endorsement of this PRINCIPLE, they proclaim to be the great object. With them, Nebraska alone is a small matter---to establish a principle, for FUTURE USE, is what they particularly desire. That future use is to be the planting of slavery wherever in the wide world, local and unorganized opposition can not prevent it. Now if you wish to give them this endorsement---if you wish to establish this principle---do so. I shall regret it; but it is your right. On the contrary if you are opposed to the principle---intend to give it no such endorsement---let no wheedling, no sophistry, divert you from throwing a direct vote against it. Some men, mostly whigs, who condemn the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration, lest they be thrown in company with the abolitionist. Will they allow me as an old whig to tell them good humoredly, that I think this is very silly? Stand with anybody that stands RIGHT. Stand with him while he is right and PART with him when he goes wrong. Stand WITH the abolitionist in restoring the Missouri Compromise; and stand AGAINST him when he attempts to repeal the fugitive slave law. In the latter case you stand with the southern disunionist. What of that? you are still right. In both cases you are right. In both cases you oppose [expose?] the dangerous extremes. In both you stand on middle ground and hold the ship level and steady. In both you are national and nothing less than national. This is good old whig ground. To desert such ground, because of any company, is to be less than a whig---less than a man---less than an American. I particularly object to the NEW position which the avowed principle of this Nebraska law gives to slavery in the body politic. I object to it because it assumes that there CAN be MORAL RIGHT in the enslaving of one man by another. I object to it as a dangerous dalliance for a few [free?] people---a sad evidence that, feeling prosperity we forget right---that liberty, as a principle, we have ceased to revere. I object to it because the fathers of the republic eschewed, and rejected it. The argument of \\\"Necessity\\\" was the only argument they ever admitted in favor of slavery; and so far, and so far only as it carried them, did they ever go. They found the institution existing among us, which they could not help; and they cast blame upon the British King for having permitted its introduction. BEFORE the constitution, they prohibited its introduction into the north-western Territory---the only country we owned, then free from it. AT the framing and adoption of the constitution, they forbore to so much as mention the word \\\"slave\\\" or \\\"slavery\\\" in the whole instrument. In the provision for the recovery of fugitives, the slave is spoken of as a \\\"PERSON HELD TO SERVICE OR LABOR.\\\" In that prohibiting the abolition of the African slave trade for twenty years, that trade is spoken of as \\\"The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States NOW EXISTING, shall think proper to admit,\\\" &c. These are the only provisions alluding to slavery. Thus, the thing is hid away, in the constitution, just as an afflicted man hides away a wen or a cancer, which he dares not cut out at once, lest he bleed to death; with the promise, nevertheless, that the cutting may begin at the end of a given time. Less than this our fathers COULD not do; and NOW [MORE?] they WOULD not do. Necessity drove them so far, and farther, they would not go. But this is not all. The earliest Congress, under the constitution, took the same view of slavery. They hedged and hemmed it in to the narrowest limits of necessity. In 1794, they prohibited an out-going slave-trade---that is, the taking of slaves FROM the United States to sell. In 1798, they prohibited the bringing of slaves from Africa, INTO the Mississippi Territory---this territory then comprising what are now the States of Mississippi and Alabama. This was TEN YEARS before they had the authority to do the same thing as to the States existing at the adoption of the constitution. In 1800 they prohibited AMERICAN CITIZENS from trading in slaves between foreign countries---as, for instance, from Africa to Brazil. In 1803 they passed a law in aid of one or two State laws, in restraint of the internal slave trade. In 1807, in apparent hot haste, they passed the law, nearly a year in advance to take effect the first day of 1808---the very first day the constitution would permit---prohibiting the African slave trade by heavy pecuniary and corporal penalties. In 1820, finding these provisions ineffectual, they declared the trade piracy, and annexed to it, the extreme penalty of death. While all this was passing in the general government, five or six of the original slave States had adopted systems of gradual emancipation; and by which the institution was rapidly becoming extinct within these limits. Thus we see, the plain unmistakable spirit of that age, towards slavery, was hostility to the PRINCIPLE, and toleration, ONLY BY NECESSITY. But NOW it is to be transformed into a \\\"sacred right.\\\" Nebraska brings it forth, places it on the high road to extension and perpetuity; and, with a pat on its back, says to it, \\\"Go, and God speed you.\\\" Henceforth it is to be the chief jewel of the nation---the very figure-head of the ship of State. Little by little, but steadily as man's march to the grave, we have been giving up the OLD for the NEW faith. Near eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for SOME men to enslave OTHERS is a \\\"sacred right of self-government.\\\" These principles can not stand together. They are as opposite as God and mammon; and whoever holds to the one, must despise the other. When Pettit, in connection with his support of the Nebraska bill, called the Declaration of Independence \\\"a self-evident lie\\\" he only did what consistency and candor require all other Nebraska men to do. Of the forty odd Nebraska Senators who sat present and heard him, no one rebuked him. Nor am I apprized that any Nebraska newspaper, or any Nebraska orator, in the whole nation, has ever yet rebuked him. If this had been said among Marion's men, Southerners though they were, what would have become of the man who said it? If this had been said to the men who captured Andre, the man who said it, would probably have been hung sooner than Andre was. If it had been said in old Independence Hall, seventy-eight years ago, the very door-keeper would have throttled the man, and thrust him into the street. Let no one be deceived. The spirit of seventy-six and the spirit of Nebraska, are utter antagonisms; and the former is being rapidly displaced by the latter. Fellow countrymen---Americans south, as well as north, shall we make no effort to arrest this? Already the liberal party throughout the world, express the apprehension \\\"that the one retrograde institution in America, is undermining the principles of progress, and fatally violating the noblest political system the world ever saw.\\\" This is not the taunt of enemies, but the warning of friends. Is it quite safe to disregard it---to despise it? Is there no danger to liberty itself, in discarding the earliest practice, and first precept of our ancient faith? In our greedy chase to make profit of the negro, let us beware, lest we \\\"cancel and tear to pieces\\\" even the white man's charter of freedom. Our republican robe is soiled, and trailed in the dust. Let us repurify it. Let us turn and wash it white, in the spirit, if not the blood, of the Revolution. Let us turn slavery from its claims of \\\"moral right,\\\" back upon its existing legal rights, and its arguments of \\\"necessity.\\\" Let us return it to the position our fathers gave it; and there let it rest in peace. Let us re-adopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it, the practices, and policy, which harmonize with it. Let north and south---let all Americans---let all lovers of liberty everywhere---join in the great and good work. If we do this, we shall not only have saved the Union; but we shall have so saved it, as to make, and to keep it, forever worthy of the saving. We shall have so saved it, that the succeeding millions of free happy people, the world over, shall rise up, and call us blessed, to the latest generations. At Springfield, twelve days ago, where I had spoken substantially as I have here, Judge Douglas replied to me---and as he is to reply to me here, I shall attempt to anticipate him, by noticing some of the points he made there. He commenced by stating I had assumed all the way through, that the principle of the Nebraska bill, would have the effect of extending slavery. He denied that this was INTENDED, or that this EFFECT would follow. I will not re-open the argument upon this point. That such was the intention, the world believed at the start, and will continue to believe. This was the COUNTENANCE of the thing; and, both friends and enemies, instantly recognized it as such. That countenance can not now be changed by argument. You can as easily argue the color out of the negroes' skin. Like the \\\"bloody hand\\\" you may wash it, and wash it, the red witness of guilt still sticks, and stares horribly at you. Next he says, congressional intervention never prevented slavery, any where---that it did not prevent it in the north west territory, now [nor?] in Illinois---that in fact, Illinois came into the Union as a slave State---that the principle of the Nebraska bill expelled it from Illinois, from several old States, from every where. Now this is mere quibbling all the way through. If the ordinance of '87 did not keep slavery out of the north west territory, how happens it that the north west shore of the Ohio river is entirely free from it; while the south east shore, less than a mile distant, along nearly the whole length of the river, is entirely covered with it? If that ordinance did not keep it out of Illinois, what was it that made the difference between Illinois and Missouri? They lie side by side, the Mississippi river only dividing them; while their early settlements were within the same latitude. Between 1810 and 1820 the number of slaves in Missouri INCREASED 7,211; while in Illinois, in the same ten years, they DECREASED 51. This appears by the census returns. During nearly all of that ten years, both were territories---not States. During this time, the ordinance forbid slavery to go into Illinois; and NOTHING forbid it to go into Missouri. It DID go into Missouri, and did NOT go into Illinois. That is the fact. Can any one doubt as to the reason of it? But, he says, Illinois came into the Union as a slave State. Silence, perhaps, would be the best answer to this flat contradiction of the known history of the country. What are the facts upon which this bold assertion is based? When we first acquired the country, as far back as 1787, there were some slaves within it, held by the French inhabitants at Kaskaskia. The territorial legislation, admitted a few negroes, from the slave States, as indentured servants. One year after the adoption of the first State constitution the whole number of them was---what do you think? just 117---while the aggregate free population was 55,094---about 470 to one. Upon this state of facts, the people framed their constitution prohibiting the further introduction of slavery, with a sort of guaranty to the owners of the few indentured servants, giving freedom to their children to be born thereafter, and making no mention whatever, of any supposed slave for life. Out of this small matter, the Judge manufactures his argument that Illinois came into the Union as a slave State. Let the facts be the answer to the argument. The principles of the Nebraska bill, he says, expelled slavery from Illinois? The principle of that bill first planted it here---that is, it first came, because there was no law to prevent it---first came before we owned the country; and finding it here, and having the ordinance of '87 to prevent its increasing, our people struggled along, and finally got rid of it as best they could. But the principle of the Nebraska bill abolished slavery in several of the old States. Well, it is true that several of the old States, in the last quarter of the last century, did adopt systems of gradual emancipation, by which the institution has finally become extinct within their limits; but it MAY or MAY NOT be true that the principle of the Nebraska bill was the cause that led to the adoption of these measures. It is now more than fifty years, since the last of these States adopted its system of emancipation. If Nebraska bill is the real author of these benevolent works, it is rather deplorable, that he has, for so long a time, ceased working all together. Is there not some reason to suspect that it was the principle of the REVOLUTION, and not the principle of Nebraska bill, that led to emancipation in these old States? Leave it to the people of those old emancipating States, and I am quite sure they will decide, that neither that, nor any other good thing, ever did, or ever will come of Nebraska bill. In the course of my main argument, Judge Douglas interrupted me to say, that the principle [of] the Nebraska bill was very old; that it originated when God made man and placed good and evil before him, allowing him to choose for himself, being responsible for the choice he should make. At the time I thought this was merely playful; and I answered it accordingly. But in his reply to me he renewed it, as a serious argument. In seriousness then, the facts of this proposition are not true as stated. God did not place good and evil before man, telling him to make his choice. On the contrary, he did tell him there was one tree, of the fruit of which, he should not eat, upon pain of certain death. I should scarcely wish so strong a prohibition against slavery in Nebraska. But this argument strikes me as not a little remarkable in another particular---in its strong resemblance to the old argument for the \\\"Divine right of Kings.\\\" By the latter, the King is to do just as he pleases with his white subjects, being responsible to God alone. By the former the white man is to do just as he pleases with his black slaves, being responsible to God alone. The two things are precisely alike; and it is but natural that they should find similar arguments to sustain them. I had argued, that the application of the principle of self-government, as contended for, would require the revival of the African slave trade---that no argument could be made in favor of a man's right to take slaves to Nebraska, which could not be equally well made in favor of his right to bring them from the coast of Africa. The Judge replied, that the constitution requires the suppression of the foreign slave trade; but does not require the prohibition of slavery in the territories. That is a mistake, in point of fact. The constitution does NOT require the action of Congress in either case; and it does AUTHORIZE it in both. And so, there is still no difference between the cases. In regard to what I had said, the advantage the slave States have over the free, in the matter of representation, the Judge replied that we, in the free States, count five free negroes as five white people, while in the slave States, they count five slaves as three whites only; and that the advantage, at last, was on the side of the free States. Now, in the slave States, they count free negroes just as we do; and it so happens that besides their slaves, they have as many free negroes as we have, and thirty-three thousand over. Thus their free negroes more than balance ours; and their advantage over us, in consequence of their slaves, still remains as I stated it. In reply to my argument, that the compromise measures of 1850, were a system of equivalents; and that the provisions of no one of them could fairly be carried to other subjects, without its corresponding equivalent being carried with it, the Judge denied out-right, that these measures had any connection with, or dependence upon, each other. This is mere desperation. If they have no connection, why are they always spoken of in connection? Why has he so spoken of them, a thousand times? Why has he constantly called them a SERIES of measures? Why does everybody call them a compromise? Why was California kept out of the Union, six or seven months, if it was not because of its connection with the other measures? Webster's leading definition of the verb \\\"to compromise\\\" is \\\"to adjust and settle a difference, by mutual agreement with concessions of claims by the parties.\\\" This conveys precisely the popular understanding of the word compromise. We knew, before the Judge told us, that these measures passed separately, and in distinct bills; and that no two of them were passed by the votes of precisely the same members. But we also know, and so does he know, that no one of them could have passed both branches of Congress but for the understanding that the others were to pass also. Upon this understanding each got votes, which it could have got in no other way. It is this fact, that gives to the measures their true character; and it is the universal knowledge of this fact, that has given them the name of compromise so expressive of that true character. I had asked \\\"If in carrying the provisions of the Utah and New Mexico laws to Nebraska, you could clear away other objection, how can you leave Nebraska 'perfectly free' to introduce slavery BEFORE she forms a constitution---during her territorial government?---while the Utah and New Mexico laws only authorize it WHEN they form constitutions, and are admitted into the Union?\\\" To this Judge Douglas answered that the Utah and New Mexico laws, also authorized it BEFORE; and to prove this, he read from one of their laws, as follows: \\\"That the legislative power of said territory shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation consistent with the constitution of the United States and the provisions of this act.\\\" Now it is perceived from the reading of this, that there is nothing express upon the subject; but that the authority is sought to be implied merely, for the general provision of \\\"all rightful subjects of legislation.\\\" In reply to this, I insist, as a legal rule of construction, as well as the plain popular view of the matter, that the EXPRESS provision for Utah and New Mexico coming in with slavery if they choose, when they shall form constitutions, is an EXCLUSION of all implied authority on the same subject---that Congress, having the subject distinctly in their minds, when they made the express provision, they therein expressed their WHOLE meaning on that subject. The Judge rather insinuated that I had found it convenient to forget the Washington territorial law passed in 1853. This was a division of Oregon, organizing the northern part, as the territory of Washington. He asserted that, by this act, the ordinance of '87 theretofore existing in Oregon, was repealed; that nearly all the members of Congress voted for it, beginning in the H.R., with Charles Allen of Massachusetts, and ending with Richard Yates, of Illinois; and that he could not understand how those who now oppose the Nebraska bill, so voted then, unless it was because it was then too soon after both the great political parties had ratified the compromises of 1850, and the ratification therefore too fresh, to be then repudiated. Now I had seen the Washington act before; and I have carefully examined it since; and I aver that there is no repeal of the ordinance of '87, or of any prohibition of slavery, in it. In express terms, there is absolutely nothing in the whole law upon the subject---in fact, nothing to lead a reader to THINK of the subject. To my judgment, it is equally free from every thing from which such repeal can be legally implied; but however this may be, are men now to be entrapped by a legal implication, extracted from covert language, introduced perhaps, for the very purpose of entrapping them? I sincerely wish every man could read this law quite through, carefully watching every sentence, and every line, for a repeal of the ordinance of '87 or any thing equivalent to it. Another point on the Washington act. If it was intended to be modelled after the Utah and New Mexico acts, as Judge Douglas, insists, why was it not inserted in it, as in them, that Washington was to come in with or without slavery as she may choose at the adoption of her constitution? It has no such provision in it; and I defy the ingenuity of man to give a reason for the omission, other than that it was not intended to follow the Utah and New Mexico laws in regard to the question of slavery. The Washington act not only differs vitally from the Utah and New Mexico acts; but the Nebraska act differs vitally from both. By the latter act the people are left ``perfectly free'' to regulate their own domestic concerns, &c.; but in all the former, all their laws are to be submitted to Congress, and if disapproved are to be null. The Washington act goes even further; it absolutely prohibits the territorial legislation [legislature?], by very strong and guarded language, from establishing banks, or borrowing money on the faith of the territory. Is this the sacred right of self-government we hear vaunted so much? No sir, the Nebraska bill finds no model in the acts of '50 or the Washington act. It finds no model in any law from Adam till today. As Phillips says of Napoleon, the Nebraska act is grand, gloomy, and peculiar; wrapped in the solitude of its own originality; without a model, and without a shadow upon the earth. In the course of his reply, Senator Douglas remarked, in substance, that he had always considered this government was made for the white people and not for the negroes. Why, in point of mere fact, I think so too. But in this remark of the Judge, there is a significance, which I think is the key to the great mistake (if there is any such mistake) which he has made in this Nebraska measure. It shows that the Judge has no very vivid impression that the negro is a human; and consequently has no idea that there can be any moral question in legislating about him. In his view, the question of whether a new country shall be slave or free, is a matter of as utter indifference, as it is whether his neighbor shall plant his farm with tobacco, or stock it with horned cattle. Now, whether this view is right or wrong, it is very certain that the great mass of mankind take a totally different view. They consider slavery a great moral wrong; and their feelings against it, is not evanescent, but eternal. It lies at the very foundation of their sense of justice; and it cannot be trifled with. It is a great and durable element of popular action, and, I think, no statesman can safely disregard it. Our Senator also objects that those who oppose him in this measure do not entirely agree with one another. He reminds me that in my firm adherence to the constitutional rights of the slave States, I differ widely from others who are co-operating with me in opposing the Nebraska bill; and he says it is not quite fair to oppose him in this variety of ways. He should remember that he took us by surprise---astounded us---by this measure. We were thunderstruck and stunned; and we reeled and fell in utter confusion. But we rose each fighting, grasping whatever he could first reach---a scythe---a pitchfork---a chopping axe, or a butcher's cleaver. We struck in the direction of the sound; and we are rapidly closing in upon him. He must not think to divert us from our purpose, by showing us that our drill, our dress, and our weapons, are not entirely perfect and uniform. When the storm shall be past, he shall find us still Americans; no less devoted to the continued Union and prosperity of the country than heretofore. Finally, the Judge invokes against me, the memory of Clay and of Webster. They were great men; and men of great deeds. But where have I assailed them? For what is it, that their life-long enemy, shall now make profit, by assuming to defend them against me, their life-long friend? I go against the repeal of the Missouri compromise; did they ever go for it? They went for the compromise of 1850; did I ever go against them? They were greatly devoted to the Union; to the small measure of my ability, was I ever less so? Clay and Webster were dead before this question arose; by what authority shall our Senator say they would espouse his side of it, if alive? Mr. Clay was the leading spirit in making the Missouri compromise; is it very credible that if now alive, he would take the lead in the breaking of it? The truth is that some support from whigs is now a necessity with the Judge, and for thus it is, that the names of Clay and Webster are now invoked. His old friends have deserted him in such numbers as to leave too few to live by. He came to his own, and his own received him not, and Lo! he turns unto the Gentiles. A word now as to the Judge's desperate assumption that the compromises of '50 had no connection with one another; that Illinois came into the Union as a slave state, and some other similar ones. This is no other than a bold denial of the history of the country. If we do not know that the Compromises of '50 were dependent on each other; if we do not know that Illinois came into the Union as a free state---we do not know any thing. If we do not know these things, we do not know that we ever had a revolutionary war, or such a chief as Washington. To deny these things is to deny our national axioms, or dogmas, at least; and it puts an end to all argument. If a man will stand up and assert, and repeat, and re-assert, that two and two do not make four, I know nothing in the power of argument that can stop him. I think I can answer the Judge so long as he sticks to the premises; but when he flies from them, I can not work an argument into the consistency of a maternal gag, and actually close his mouth with it. In such a case I can only commend him to the seventy thousand answers just in from Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.\"\n",
